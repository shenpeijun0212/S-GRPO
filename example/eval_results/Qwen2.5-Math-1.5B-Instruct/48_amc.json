            "To determine the number of ways to split the integers \\(1\\) through \\(14\\) into \\(7\\) pairs such that in each pair, the greater number is at least \\(2\\) times the lesser number, we need to carefully analyze the possible pairs that can be formed.\n\nFirst, let's list the possible pairs:\n- If the lesser number is \\(1\\), the greater number can be \\(2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14\\). However, since the greater number must be at least \\(2\\) times the lesser number, the possible greater numbers are \\(2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14\\). This gives us the pairs \\((1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8), (1, 9), (1, 10), (1, 11), (1, 12), (1, 13), (1, 14)\\).\n- If the lesser number is \\(2\\), the greater number can be \\(4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14\\).

This gives us the pairs \\((5, 10), (5, 11), (5, 12), (5, 13), (5, 14)\\).\n- If the lesser number is \\(6\\), the greater number can be \\(12, 13, 14\\). This gives us the pairs \\((6, 12), (6, 13), (6, 14)\\).\n- If the lesser number is \\(7\\), the greater number can be \\(14\\). This gives us the pair \\((7, 14)\\).\n\nNow, we need to count the number of ways to form these pairs. We can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion or a combinatorial argument, but a simpler approach is to recognize that each number from \\(1\\) to \\(7\\) must be paired with a number that is at least twice its value, and each number from \\(8\\) to \\(14\\) must be paired with a number that is at least twice its value. This can be done in a unique way for each number, and the number of ways to pair them is simply the number of ways to arrange the pairs, which is \\(7!\\) (the number of ways to arrange 7 pairs).\n\nTherefore, the number of ways to split the integers \\(1\\) through \\(14\\) into \\(7\\) pairs such that in each pair, the greater number is at least \\(2\\) times the lesser number is \\(\\boxed{1}\\)."

The only way this can happen is if the first card picked up in the first pass is the smallest card, and the last card picked up in the second pass is the largest card. This is because if any other card is left after the first pass, it would not be possible to pick it up in the second pass in increasing order.\n\nTherefore, the first card picked up must be card 1, and the last card picked up must be card 13. This leaves us with the task of arranging the remaining 11 cards (cards 2 through 12) in any order. The number of ways to arrange 11 cards is given by \\(11!\\).\n\nThus, the number of ways to arrange the 13 cards such that they are picked up in exactly two passes is \\(11!\\).\n\nCalculating \\(11!\\):\n\\[\n11! = 11 \\times 10 \\times 9 \\times 8 \\times 7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 39916800\n\\]\n\nSo, the number of such arrangements is \\(\\boxed{39916800}\\)."

From the first question:\n\\[ T + \\frac{18}{2} = 22, \\]\n\\[ T + 9 = 22, \\]\n\\[ T = 13. \\]\nFrom the second question:\n\\[ L + \\frac{18}{2} = 15, \\]\n\\[ L + 9 = 15, \\]\n\\[ L = 6. \\]\nWe can now find the number of truth-tellers by using the total number of children:\n\\[ T + L + A = 31, \\]\n\\[ 13 + 6 + 18 = 37, \\]\nwhich is consistent with the total number of children. Therefore, the number of truth-tellers is \\( T = 13 \\).\n\n### Step 5: Determine the number of pieces of candy given to truth-tellers\nSince the principal gave a piece of candy to each of the 22 children who answered \"Yes\" to the first question, and all truth-tellers answered \"Yes\" to this question, the principal gave \\( T = 13 \\) pieces of candy to the truth-tellers.\n\nThus, the number of pieces of candy the principal gave to the children who always tell the truth is \\(\\boxed{13}\\)."

The rectangle has side lengths 4 and 8, and the square has a side length of 5. The square is positioned such that three of its vertices lie on three different sides of the rectangle.\n\nFirst, let's place the rectangle in the coordinate plane with vertices at \\((0,0)\\), \\((8,0)\\), \\((8,4)\\), and \\((0,4)\\). Assume the square is positioned such that one of its vertices is at \\((x,0)\\) on the bottom side of the rectangle, another vertex is at \\((8,y)\\) on the right side of the rectangle, and the third vertex is at \\((8-x,4)\\) on the top side of the rectangle. The side length of the square is 5, so the distance between \\((x,0)\\) and \\((8,y)\\) is 5, and the distance between \\((8,y)\\) and \\((8-x,4)\\) is also 5.\n\nSince the distance between \\((x,0)\\) and \\((8,y)\\) is 5, we have:\n\\[\n(8-x)^2 + y^2 = 25\n\\]\nSince the distance between \\((8,y)\\) and \\((8-x,4)\\) is 5, we have:\n\\[\nx^2 + (4-y)^2 = 25\n\\]\n\nWe also know that the distance between \\((x,0)\\) and \\((8-x,4)\\) is 5, so:\n\\[\nx^2 + 4^2 = 25 \\implies x^2 + 16 = 25 \\implies x^2 = 9 \\implies x = 3 \\text{ (since } x \\text{ must be positive)}\n\\]\nSubstituting \\(x = 3\\) into the first equation, we get:\n\\[\n(8-3)^2 + y^2 = 25 \\implies 5^2 + y^2 = 25 \\implies 25 + y^2 = 25 \\implies y^2 = 0 \\implies y = 0\n\\]\nThis is not possible since \\(y\\) must be positive.

The probability that \\( x_1 + x_2 + x_3 > 1 \\) is the volume of the region in the unit cube above the plane \\( x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = 1 \\), which is the complement of the tetrahedron, so the volume is \\( 1 - \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{5}{6} \\).

Let's hypothesize that \\(x_k = 0\\) for all \\(k \\geq 0\\). We need to check if this hypothesis satisfies the given condition for all \\(n\\):\n\\[S_n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} x_k 2^k = 1.\\]\nThen,\n\\[7S_n = 7 \\cdot 1 = 7 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2^n}.\\]\nThis is true for all \\(n \\geq 1\\), so our hypothesis is correct. Therefore, \\(x_k = 0\\) for all \\(k \\geq 0\\).\n\nNow, we need to find the value of the sum \\(x_{2019} + 2x_{2020} + 4x_{2021} + 8x_{2022}\\):\n\\[x_{2019} + 2x_{2020} + 4x_{2021} + 8x_{2022} = 0 + 2 \\cdot 0 + 4 \\cdot 0 + 8 \\cdot 0 = 0.\\]\n\nThus, the value of the sum is \\(\\boxed{0}\\)."

The number of terms in this sequence can be found by solving the equation:\n\\[ 7n \\leq 1000 \\implies n \\leq \\frac{1000}{7} \\approx 142.857. \\]\nSo, there are 142 multiples of 7 in the range from 1 to 1000.\n\nNow, we need to determine how these multiples of 7 are distributed across the 100 sets. Each set of 10 consecutive integers will contain exactly one multiple of 7 if the set starts with a number that is not a multiple of 7. If the set starts with a multiple of 7, it will contain either one or two multiples of 7 depending on the position of the set.\n\nTo find out how many sets contain exactly two multiples of 7, we need to count the sets that start with a multiple of 7. The multiples of 7 in the range from 1 to 1000 are 7, 14, 21, ..., 994. These are 142 numbers, and they are evenly distributed across the 100 sets. Therefore, each set of 10 numbers will contain exactly one multiple of 7 if it starts with a number that is not a multiple of 7, and it will contain two multiples of 7 if it starts with a multiple of 7.\n\nSince there are 142 multiples of 7 and they are evenly distributed across 100 sets, the number of sets that start with a multiple of 7 is:\n\\[ \\left\\lfloor \\frac{142}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 14 + 1 = 14. \\]\nThis is because the first 14 sets will each contain exactly one multiple of 7, and the remaining sets will each contain exactly two multiples of 7.\n\nThus, the number of sets that contain exactly two multiples of 7 is:\n\\[ 100 - 14 = 86. \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of sets that contain exactly two multiples of 7 is:\n\\[ \\boxed{86}. \\]"

The distance \\(d(A, B)\\) between two vertices \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) is the minimum number of edges one must traverse to connect them.\n\nThe possible values for \\(d(A, B)\\) are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Specifically:\n- \\(d(A, B) = 1\\) if \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are adjacent vertices (i.e., they are connected by an edge).\n- \\(d(A, B) = 2\\) if \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are vertices that are not adjacent but are connected by a path of two edges.\n- \\(d(A, B) = 3\\) if \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are vertices that are not adjacent and are connected by a path of three edges.\n- \\(d(A, B) = 4\\) if \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are vertices that are not adjacent and are connected by a path of four edges.\n- \\(d(A, B) = 5\\) if \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are opposite vertices (i.e., they are connected by a path of five edges).\n\nWe need to find the probability that \\(d(Q, R) > d(R, S)\\) for randomly chosen distinct vertices \\(Q\\), \\(R\\), and \\(S\\) of the icosahedron. First, we count the number of pairs \\((Q, R)\\) and \\((R, S)\\) such that \\(d(Q, R) > d(R, S)\\).\n\nThere are three cases to consider:\n1. \\(d(Q, R) = 5\\) and \\(d(R, S) = 4\\)\n2. \\(d(Q, R) = 5\\) and \\(d(R, S) = 3\\)\n3. \\(d(Q, R) = 5\\) and \\(d(R, S) = 2\\)\n4. \\(d(Q, R) = 5\\) and \\(d(R, S) = 1\\)\n5. \\(d(Q, R) = 4\\) and \\(d(R, S) = 3\\)\n6. \\(d(Q, R) = 4\\) and \\(d(R, S) = 2\\)\n7. \\(d(Q, R) = 4\\) and \\(d(R, S) = 1\\)\n8. \\(d(Q, R) = 3\\) and \\(d(R, S) = 2\\)\n9. \\(d(Q, R) = 3\\) and \\(d(R, S) = 1\\)\n10. \\(d(Q, R) = 2\\) and \\(d(R, S) = 1\\)\n\nWe need to count the number of valid configurations for each case. However, a simpler approach is to use symmetry and the fact that the icosahedron is a highly symmetric structure. By symmetry, the probability that \\(d(Q, R) > d(R, S)\\) is the same as the probability that \\(d(Q, R) < d(R, S)\\), and the probability that \\(d(Q, R) = d(R, S)\\) is relatively small. Therefore, the probability that \\(d(Q, R) > d(R, S)\\) is approximately \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\nTo find the exact probability, we can use combinatorial arguments or symmetry arguments. The exact probability is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\), so the probability that \\(d(Q, R) > d(R, S)\\) is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\nThus, the probability is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\), and the final answer is \\(1 + 2 = 3\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{3}\n\\]"

            "To determine the probability that Janet's running total equals 3 at some point during her four rolls of a standard 6-sided die, we need to consider all possible sequences of rolls and identify those sequences where the running total reaches 3 at some point.\n\nFirst, let's list all possible sequences of four rolls and count the number of sequences where the running total reaches 3 at some point. We will use a systematic approach to ensure we cover all possibilities.\n\nThe total number of possible sequences of four rolls is \\(6^4 = 1296\\).\n\nWe need to count the number of sequences where the running total is 3 at some point. We can do this by considering the possible values of the running total after each roll and checking if it can reach 3.\n\nLet's denote the running total after \\(k\\) rolls as \\(S_k\\). We need to find sequences where \\(S_i = 3\\) for some \\(i\\) in \\(\\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}\\).\n\n### Case 1: \\(S_1 = 3\\)\nThe only way to get a running total of 3 with the first roll is if the first roll is 3. There is only 1 sequence: (3).\n\n### Case 2: \\(S_2 = 3\\)\nThe running total can be 3 if the first roll is 1 and the second roll is 2, or the first roll is 2 and the second roll is 1, or the first roll is 3 and the second roll is 0 (which is not possible since the minimum roll is 1). So, there are 2 sequences: (1, 2) and (2, 1).\n\n### Case 3: \\(S_3 = 3\\)\nThe running total can be 3 if the first two rolls are (1, 2) and the third roll is 0 (not possible), or (2, 1) and the third roll is 0 (not possible), or the first roll is 1, the second roll is 1, and the third roll is 1. So, there is 1 sequence: (1, 1, 1).\n\n### Case 4: \\(S_4 = 3\\)\nThe running total can be 3 if the first three rolls are (1, 1, 1) and the fourth roll is 0 (not possible), or the first roll is 1, the second roll is 2, and the third roll is 0 (not possible), or the first roll is 2, the second roll is 1, and the third roll is 0 (not possible), or the first roll is 3, the second roll is 0 (not possible), or the first roll is 1, the second roll is 1, the third roll is 1, and the fourth roll is 0 (not possible).

            "To determine how many dates in 2023 will have each digit appearing an even number of times in the 8-digit display, we need to analyze the structure of the date format, which is YMMDD. Here, Y is the year (2023), MM is the month, and DD is the day. The year 2023 has the digits 2, 0, 2, and 3, which means the digits 2 and 3 appear twice, and the digits 0 and 1 appear once. The month MM can range from 01 to 12, and the day DD can range from 01 to 31. We need to ensure that each digit in the 8-digit number 2023MMDD appears an even number of times.\n\nFirst, let's consider the digits in the year 2023:\n- The digit 2 appears twice.\n- The digit 0 appears once.\n- The digit 3 appears twice.\n- The digit 1 appears once.\n\nFor the entire 8-digit number to have each digit appearing an even number of times, the digits in MM and DD must make up for the odd counts of 0 and 1 in 2023. This means that the digits in MM and DD must collectively contribute an odd number of 0s and 1s to make the total count of each digit even.\n\nLet's analyze the possible values for MM and DD:\n- The month MM can be any number from 01 to 12. Among these, the months that contain the digit 0 are 01, 02, 03, 04, 05, 06, 07, 08, 09, and 00 (which is not a valid month). So, the valid months are 01, 02, 03, 04, 05, 06, 07, 08, and 09. This gives us 9 possible months.\n- The month MM can be any number from 01 to 12, and the day DD can be any number from 01 to 31. Among these, the days that contain the digit 1 are 01, 02, 03, 04, 05, 06, 07, 08, 09, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, and 31. This gives us 31 possible days.\n\nNow, we need to count the number of valid (MM, DD) pairs such that the total count of each digit (0, 1, 2, 3) is even. This means that the number of 0s and 1s in MM and DD must collectively be odd. Let's break this down:\n- If MM has 0 as a digit, it can be 01, 02, 03, 04, 05, 06, 07, 08, or 09. This gives us 9 choices for MM.\n- If MM has 1 as a digit, it can be 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 21, 31. This gives us 12 choices for MM.\n- If MM has neither 0 nor 1 as a digit, it can be 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39. This gives us 16 choices for MM.\n\nFor each choice of MM, DD must be chosen such that the total count of each digit is even. This means that if MM has an even number of 0s and 1s, DD must have an odd number of 0s and 1s, and vice versa. The number of valid DD for each MM is half of the total number of days (since half of the days will have an odd number of 0s and 1s, and half will have an even number of 0s and 1s).\n\nTherefore, the total number of valid (MM, DD) pairs is:\n\\[ 9 \\times 16 + 12 \\times 16 + 16 \\times 16 = 144 + 192 + 256 = 592. \\]\n\nThus, the number of dates in 2023 for which each digit appears an even number of times in the 8-digit display is \\(\\boxed{32}\\)."

            "To find the maximum area of an isosceles trapezoid with legs of length 1 and one base twice as long as the other, we start by defining the lengths of the bases. Let the lengths of the bases be \\(a\\) and \\(2a\\). We will drop perpendiculars from the endpoints of the shorter base to the longer base, creating two right triangles and a rectangle in the middle. The height of the trapezoid is the same as the height of these right triangles.\n\nLet the height of the trapezoid be \\(h\\). The legs of the trapezoid are the hypotenuses of the right triangles, each with a base of \\(\\frac{2a - a}{2} = \\frac{a}{2}\\).

This problem can be approached using the concept of the Frobenius coin problem, which deals with finding the largest number that cannot be expressed as a non-negative integer combination of given coin values.\n\nFirst, we note that the coin values are 6, 10, and 15. We will use the fact that for two coprime integers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), the largest number that cannot be expressed as a non-negative integer combination of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) is given by \\( ab - a - b \\). However, since we have three coin values, we need to consider the problem more carefully.\n\nWe start by checking if any two of the coin values are coprime. The greatest common divisor (gcd) of 6 and 10 is 2, so they are not coprime. The gcd of 6 and 15 is 3, so they are not coprime. The gcd of 10 and 15 is 5, so they are not coprime. Since none of the pairs are coprime, we need to use a different approach.\n\nWe will use the fact that the largest number that cannot be formed using three coin values can be found by checking the combinations of the coin values. We will start by checking the largest number that cannot be formed using only the 6 and 10 cent coins, and then check if adding the 15 cent coin changes the result.\n\nThe largest number that cannot be formed using only 6 and 10 cent coins is given by the Frobenius number for 6 and 10, which is \\( 6 \\times 10 - 6 - 10 = 50 \\). However, we need to check if adding the 15 cent coin changes this result.\n\nWe will check the numbers from 51 upwards to see if they can be formed using the coins 6, 10, and 15.

            "To determine the number of standard six-sided dice \\( n \\) that can produce 936 possible distinct products, we need to analyze the prime factorization of the possible products. Each die can roll a number from 1 to 6, and the prime factorizations of these numbers are:\n\n\\[\n1 = 1, \\quad 2 = 2, \\quad 3 = 3, \\quad 4 = 2^2, \\quad 5 = 5, \\quad 6 = 2 \\cdot 3\n\\]\n\nThe product of the numbers rolled will be a number whose prime factorization is composed of the primes 2, 3, and 5. Let's denote the number of dice that show a 1 by \\( a \\), the number of dice that show a 2 by \\( b \\), the number of dice that show a 3 by \\( c \\), the number of dice that show a 4 by \\( d \\), the number of dice that show a 5 by \\( e \\), and the number of dice that show a 6 by \\( f \\). The total number of dice is \\( n = a + b + c + d + e + f \\).\n\nThe exponent of 2 in the prime factorization of the product is \\( b + 2d + f \\), the exponent of 3 is \\( c + d + f \\), and the exponent of 5 is \\( e + f \\). We need to find the number of distinct combinations of these exponents that can be formed.\n\nThe possible exponents for 2 range from 0 to \\( 2n \\) (since each die can contribute at most 2 factors of 2), but the actual range is from 0 to \\( 2n \\) because the maximum exponent of 2 is \\( 2n \\) (if all dice show 4). Similarly, the possible exponents for 3 range from 0 to \\( 2n \\) (since each die can contribute at most 1 factor of 3), and the possible exponents for 5 range from 0 to \\( n \\) (since each die can contribute at most 1 factor of 5).\n\nThe number of distinct products is the number of distinct combinations of these exponents. This is equivalent to the number of distinct values that the exponents of 2, 3, and 5 can take, which is the number of distinct values that \\( b + 2d + f \\), \\( c + d + f \\), and \\( e + f \\) can take.
