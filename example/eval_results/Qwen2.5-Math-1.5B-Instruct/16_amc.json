This gives us the pairs \\((1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8), (1, 9), (1, 10), (1, 11), (1, 12), (1, 13), (1, 14)\\).\n- If the lesser number is \\(2\\), the greater number can be \\(4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14\\).

This gives us the pair \\((7, 14)\\).\n\nNow, we need to count the number of ways to form these pairs. We can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion or a combinatorial argument, but a simpler approach is to recognize that each number from \\(1\\) to \\(7\\) must be paired with a number that is at least twice its value, and each number from \\(8\\) to \\(14\\) must be paired with a number that is at least twice its value. This can be done in a unique way for each number, and the number of ways to pair them is simply the number of ways to arrange the pairs, which is \\(7!\\) (the number of ways to arrange 7 pairs).\n\nTherefore, the number of ways to split the integers \\(1\\) through \\(14\\) into \\(7\\) pairs such that in each pair, the greater number is at least \\(2\\) times the lesser number is \\(\\boxed{1}\\)."

            "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the responses given by the children to the three questions and determine how many of each type of child (truth-teller, liar, and alternater) there are.

We know that the total number of children is 31, so we have:\n\n\\[ T + L + A = 31 \\]\n\nNext, we analyze the responses to the three questions:\n\n1. \"Are you a truth-teller?\" The truth-tellers will answer \"Yes,\" the liars will answer \"No,\" and the alternaters will alternate between \"Yes\" and \"No.\" Since the alternaters alternate, half of them will answer \"Yes\" and half will answer \"No.\" Therefore, the number of children who answered \"Yes\" to this question is:\n\n\\[ T + \\frac{A}{2} = 22 \\]\n\n2. \"Are you an alternater?\" The truth-tellers will answer \"No,\" the liars will answer \"Yes,\" and the alternaters will alternate between \"Yes\" and \"No.\" Therefore, the number of children who answered \"Yes\" to this question is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{A}{2} = 15 \\]\n\n3. \"Are you a liar?\" The truth-tellers will answer \"No,\" the liars will answer \"Yes,\" and the alternaters will alternate between \"Yes\" and \"No.\" Therefore, the number of children who answered \"Yes\" to this question is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{A}{2} = 9 \\]\n\nFrom the second and third questions, we can determine the number of alternaters:\n\n\\[ \\frac{A}{2} = 15 \\implies A = 30 \\]\n\\[ \\frac{A}{2} = 9 \\implies A = 18 \\]\n\nThere seems to be a contradiction here, but let's re-evaluate the problem. The correct interpretation is that the alternaters' responses to the second and third questions are consistent with the fact that they alternate. Therefore, the correct interpretation is that the number of alternaters is 18, and the number of children who answered \"Yes\" to the second question is 15, and the number of children who answered \"Yes\" to the third question is 9. This means that the number of truth-tellers is:\n\n\\[ T = 22 - \\frac{18}{2} = 22 - 9 = 13 \\]\n\nAnd the number of liars is:\n\n\\[ L = 31 - T - A = 31 - 13 - 18 = 0 \\]\n\nSo, the number of truth-tellers is 13.

Using the change of base formula again, we have:\n\n\\[\n\\log_7 2023 = \\frac{\\log_{10}2023}{\\log_{10}7}, \\quad \\log_{289} 2023 = \\frac{\\log_{10}2023}{\\log_{10}289}\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n\\log_7 2023 \\cdot \\log_{289} 2023 = \\frac{\\log_{10}2023}{\\log_{10}7} \\cdot \\frac{\\log_{10}2023}{\\log_{10}289} = \\frac{(\\log_{10}2023)^2}{\\log_{10}7 \\log_{10}289}\n\\]\n\nSince \\(\\log_{10}289 = 2 \\log_{10}17\\), we have:\n\n\\[\n\\log_7 2023 \\cdot \\log_{289} 2023 = \\frac{(\\log_{10}2023)^2}{\\log_{10}7 \\cdot 2 \\log_{10}17} = \\frac{(\\log_{10}2023)^2}{2 \\log_{10}7 \\log_{10}17}\n\\]\n\nWe need to check if this equals 1. Since \\(\\log_{10}2023 = \\log_{10}(7 \\cdot 17^2) = \\log_{10}7 + 2 \\log_{10}17\\), we have:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{(\\log_{10}7 + 2 \\log_{10}17)^2}{2 \\log_{10}7 \\log_{10}17} = 1\n\\]\n\nThis is true, so \\(x = 1\\) is indeed a solution. To find other solutions, we need to consider the quadratic nature of the equation. By solving the quadratic equation, we find that the other solution is \\(x = \\frac{1}{7}\\). Therefore, the product of all solutions is:\n\n\\[\n1 \\cdot \\frac{1}{7} = \\frac{1}{7}\n\\]\n\nThus, the product of all solutions to the equation is \\(\\boxed{\\frac{1}{7}}\\)."

We will consider the possible values of \\(d(Q, R)\\) and \\(d(R, S)\\) and count the number of favorable outcomes.\n\n1. If \\(d(Q, R) = 1\\), then \\(d(R, S)\\) can be 2, 3, or 4. There are 5 vertices at distance 2, 10 vertices at distance 3, and 1 vertex at distance 4 from \\(R\\). So, there are \\(5 + 10 + 1 = 16\\) favorable outcomes.\n2. If \\(d(Q, R) = 2\\), then \\(d(R, S)\\) can be 3 or 4. There are 10 vertices at distance 3 and 1 vertex at distance 4 from \\(R\\). So, there are \\(10 + 1 = 11\\) favorable outcomes.\n3. If \\(d(Q, R) = 3\\), then \\(d(R, S)\\) can be 4. There is 1 vertex at distance 4 from \\(R\\). So, there is 1 favorable outcome.\n4. If \\(d(Q, R) = 4\\), then there are no vertices at distance 4 from \\(R\\). So, there are 0 favorable outcomes.\n\nThe total number of favorable outcomes is \\(16 + 11 + 1 = 28\\). The total number of possible outcomes is \\(11 \\times 11 = 121\\) (since there are 11 choices for \\(R\\) and 11 choices for \\(S\\) after choosing \\(Q\\)).\n\nTherefore, the probability that \\(d(Q, R) > d(R, S)\\) is \\(\\frac{28}{121}\\). The values of \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) are 28 and 121, respectively, and their sum is \\(28 + 121 = 149\\).\n\nThe answer is \\(\\boxed{149}\\)."

            "To determine the value of \\( x \\) in Coinland, we need to find the largest amount of money that cannot be expressed using the given coin values of 6, 10, and 15 cents. This problem can be approached using the concept of the Frobenius coin problem, which deals with finding the largest number that cannot be expressed as a non-negative integer combination of given coin values.\n\nFirst, we note that the coin values are 6, 10, and 15. We will use the fact that for two coprime integers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), the largest number that cannot be expressed as a non-negative integer combination of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) is given by \\( ab - a - b \\). However, since we have three coin values, we need to consider the problem more carefully.\n\nWe start by checking if any two of the coin values are coprime. The greatest common divisor (gcd) of 6 and 10 is 2, so they are not coprime. The gcd of 6 and 15 is 3, so they are not coprime. The gcd of 10 and 15 is 5, so they are not coprime. Since none of the pairs are coprime, we need to use a different approach.\n\nWe will use the fact that the largest number that cannot be expressed using three coin values can be found by checking the combinations of the coin values. We will start by checking the largest number that cannot be expressed using only the 6 and 10 cent coins, and then check if adding the 15 cent coin changes the result.\n\nThe largest number that cannot be expressed using only 6 and 10 cent coins is given by the Frobenius number for 6 and 10, which is \\( 6 \\times 10 - 6 - 10 = 50 \\). However, we need to check if adding the 15 cent coin changes this result.\n\nWe will check the numbers from 51 upwards to see if they can be expressed using the coin values 6, 10, and 15. We can use a systematic approach to check each number:\n\n- 51: Not possible (51 = 3 \\times 15 + 6 \\times 1)\n- 52: Not possible (52 = 2 \\times 15 + 6 \\times 2)\n- 53: Not possible (53 = 3 \\times 15 + 6 \\times 1 + 10 \\times 1)\n- 54: Possible (54 = 9 \\times 6)\n- 55: Possible (55 = 3 \\times 15 + 10 \\times 1)\n- 56: Possible (56 = 2 \\times 15 + 6 \\times 2)\n- 57: Possible (57 = 3 \\times 15 + 6 \\times 1)\n- 58: Possible (58 = 2 \\times 15 + 6 \\times 2 + 10 \\times 1)\n- 59: Possible (59 = 3 \\times 15 + 6 \\times 1 + 10 \\times 1)\n- 60: Possible (60 = 4 \\times 15)\n\nFrom the above, we see that 59 is the largest number that cannot be expressed using the coin values 6, 10, and 15. Therefore, the value of \\( x \\) is 49.\n\nThe sum of the digits of 49 is \\( 4 + 9 = 13 \\).\n\nThus, the answer is \\(\\boxed{13}\\)."

Since the triangle has an angle of \\(120^\\circ\\), we can use the Law of Cosines to find \\(d\\).\n\nThe Law of Cosines states that for a triangle with sides \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) and angle \\(\\gamma\\) opposite side \\(c\\), we have:\n\\[ c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \\cos(\\gamma). \\]\nIn our case, let the side opposite the \\(120^\\circ\\) angle be \\(6+2d\\). Then, we have:\n\\[ (6+2d)^2 = 6^2 + (6+d)^2 - 2 \\cdot 6 \\cdot (6+d) \\cdot \\cos(120^\\circ). \\]\nSince \\(\\cos(120^\\circ) = -\\frac{1}{2}\\), the equation becomes:\n\\[ (6+2d)^2 = 36 + (6+d)^2 + 6(6+d). \\]\nExpanding both sides, we get:\n\\[ 36 + 24d + 4d^2 = 36 + 36 + 12d + d^2 + 36 + 6d, \\]\n\\[ 36 + 24d + 4d^2 = 108 + 18d + d^2. \\]\nRearranging terms, we have:\n\\[ 3d^2 + 6d - 72 = 0, \\]\n\\[ d^2 + 2d - 24 = 0. \\]\nThis quadratic equation can be factored as:\n\\[ (d+6)(d-4) = 0. \\]\nThus, \\(d = 4\\) (since \\(d = -6\\) would make the side lengths negative, which is not possible). Therefore, the side lengths of the triangle are 6, 10, and 14.\n\nNext, we use the formula for the area of a triangle given two sides and the included angle:\n\\[ \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2}ab \\sin(\\gamma). \\]\nHere, \\(a = 6\\), \\(b = 10\\), and \\(\\gamma = 120^\\circ\\).

            "To determine the number of standard six-sided dice \\( n \\) that can produce 936 possible distinct products, we need to analyze the prime factorization of the possible products. Each die can roll a number from 1 to 6, and the prime factorizations of these numbers are:\n\n\\[\n1 = 1, \\quad 2 = 2, \\quad 3 = 3, \\quad 4 = 2^2, \\quad 5 = 5, \\quad 6 = 2 \\cdot 3\n\\]\n\nThe product of the numbers rolled will be a number whose prime factorization is composed of the primes 2, 3, and 5. Let's denote the number of dice that show a 1 by \\( a \\), the number of dice that show a 2 by \\( b \\), the number of dice that show a 3 by \\( c \\), the number of dice that show a 4 by \\( d \\), the number of dice that show a 5 by \\( e \\), and the number of dice that show a 6 by \\( f \\). The total number of dice is \\( n = a + b + c + d + e + f \\).\n\nThe exponent of 2 in the prime factorization of the product is \\( b + 2d + f \\), the exponent of 3 is \\( c + d + f \\), and the exponent of 5 is \\( e + f \\). We need to find the number of distinct combinations of these exponents that can be formed.\n\nThe possible exponents for 2 range from 0 to \\( 2n \\) (since each die can contribute at most 2 factors of 2), but the actual range is from 0 to \\( 2n \\) because the maximum exponent is \\( 2n \\) when all dice show a 4. Similarly, the possible exponents for 3 range from 0 to \\( 2n \\), and the possible exponents for 5 range from 0 to \\( n \\).\n\nThe number of distinct products is the number of distinct combinations of these exponents. This is equivalent to the number of distinct values that the exponents of 2, 3, and 5 can take, which is the number of distinct values that the exponents can take in the range from 0 to the maximum possible value.\n\nThe maximum possible value for the exponent of 2 is \\( 2n \\), for the exponent of 3 is \\( 2n \\), and for the exponent of 5 is \\( n \\). The number of distinct values for each exponent is \\( 2n + 1 \\) for 2 and 3, and \\( n + 1 \\) for 5.
