The factors of \\(-6\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 3, \\pm 6\\) and the factors of \\(10\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 5, \\pm 10\\). Therefore, the possible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{1}{5}, \\pm \\frac{1}{10}, \\pm 2, \\pm 3, \\pm \\frac{3}{2}, \\pm \\frac{3}{5}, \\pm \\frac{3}{10}, \\pm 6\\).\n\nLet's test these possible roots.

            "To solve for the positive integer \\( n \\) given the conditions, we start by analyzing the least common multiple (LCM) and greatest common divisor (GCD) conditions.\n\nFirst, we know that the LCM of \\( n \\) and 18 is 180. The prime factorizations are:\n\\[ 18 = 2 \\cdot 3^2 \\]\n\\[ 180 = 2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5 \\]\nThe LCM of two numbers is the product of the highest powers of all prime factors present in either number. Therefore, \\( n \\) must include the factor \\( 2^2 \\) (since 18 only has \\( 2^1 \\) and the LCM has \\( 2^2 \\)), the factor \\( 5 \\) (since 18 does not have 5 and the LCM does), and can include at most \\( 3^2 \\) (since 18 already has \\( 3^2 \\)). So, we can write:\n\\[ n = 2^2 \\cdot 3^a \\cdot 5 \\cdot k \\]\nwhere \\( a \\leq 2 \\) and \\( k \\) is an integer that does not contain the prime factors 2, 3, or 5.\n\nNext, we use the GCD condition. The GCD of \\( n \\) and 45 is 15. The prime factorizations are:\n\\[ 45 = 3^2 \\cdot 5 \\]\n\\[ 15 = 3 \\cdot 5 \\]\nThe GCD of two numbers is the product of the lowest powers of all prime factors present in both numbers. Therefore, \\( n \\) must include the factor \\( 3 \\) and \\( 5 \\), but no higher power of 3 than \\( 3^1 \\) (since the GCD is \\( 3^1 \\cdot 5 \\)). So, we can write:\n\\[ n = 2^2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot k \\]\nwhere \\( k \\) is an integer that does not contain the prime factors 2, 3, or 5.\n\nCombining the two conditions, we see that \\( n \\) must be of the form:\n\\[ n = 2^2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 = 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 = 60 \\]\nWe need to verify that this \\( n \\) satisfies both conditions:\n1.

The GCD of 60 and 45 is:\n\\[ \\text{GCD}(60, 45) = \\text{GCD}(2^2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5, 3^2 \\cdot 5) = 3 \\cdot 5 = 15 \\]\nBoth conditions are satisfied, so \\( n = 60 \\).\n\nFinally, we find the sum of the digits of 60:\n\\[ 6 + 0 = 6 \\]\nThus, the sum of the digits of \\( n \\) is \\(\\boxed{6}\\)."

The numbers that are not greater than 4 are 1, 2, 3, and 4. So, the probability that a single die shows a number that is not greater than 4 is \\( \\frac{4}{6} = \\frac{2}{3} \\).

The probability for this case is:\n\\[ \\binom{4}{2} \\cdot \\left( \\frac{2}{6} \\right)^2 \\cdot \\left( \\frac{2}{3} \\right)^2 = 6 \\cdot \\left( \\frac{1}{3} \\right)^2 \\cdot \\left( \\frac{2}{3} \\right)^2 = 6 \\cdot \\frac{1}{9} \\cdot \\frac{4}{9} = \\frac{24}{81} = \\frac{8}{27}. \\]\n\nSo, the total probability \\( P(A \\cap B) \\) is:\n\\[ P(A \\cap B) = \\frac{32}{81} + \\frac{24}{81} = \\frac{56}{81}. \\]\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the denominator minus the numerator\nThe probability \\( P(A \\cap B) \\) is \\( \\frac{56}{81} \\).

            "To determine the area of the region inside both the square and the rectangle, we start by visualizing the given shapes. The rectangle has side lengths 4 and 8, and the square has a side length of 5.

Assume the square is positioned such that one of its vertices is at \\((x,0)\\) on the bottom side of the rectangle, another vertex is at \\((8,y)\\) on the right side of the rectangle, and the third vertex is at \\((8-x,4)\\) on the top side of the rectangle.\n\nSince the side length of the square is 5, the distance between \\((x,0)\\) and \\((8,y)\\) is 5. Similarly, the distance between \\((8,y)\\) and \\((8-x,4)\\) is 5. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the coordinates of the vertices of the square.\n\nFirst, we find the coordinates of the fourth vertex of the square, which is at \\((x,4)\\). The distance between \\((x,0)\\) and \\((x,4)\\) is 4, and the distance between \\((x,4)\\) and \\((8-y,4)\\) is \\(8-x\\).

This region is a quadrilateral with vertices at \\((3,0)\\), \\((8,3)\\), \\((3,4)\\), and \\((0,3)\\).\n\nWe can use the Shoelace Theorem to find the area of this quadrilateral.

However, a more straightforward approach is to use the fact that the problem is equivalent to finding the number of \\(4 \\times 4\\) 0-1 matrices with the given row and column sums.\n\nThe number of such matrices is given by the formula for the number of 0-1 matrices with specified row and column sums, which is the coefficient of \\(x_1 x_2 x_3 x_4\\) in the expansion of the polynomial \\((x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4)(x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4^2)(x_1 + x_2^3)(x_1^4)\\).\n\nHowever, a simpler combinatorial approach is to use the fact that the number of such matrices is the same as the number of ways to permute the rows and columns of a matrix with the given row and column sums. This is a well-known problem in combinatorics, and the answer is given by the formula for the number of 4x4 0-1 matrices with specified row and column sums, which is 90.\n\nTherefore, the number of such arrays is 90. The remainder when 90 is divided by 100 is \\(\\boxed{090}\\)."

Finally, we need to determine \\(m+n+p\\).\n\nFirst, recall that the centroid \\(G\\) of a triangle divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the longer segment being closer to the vertex. Therefore, \\(AG = \\frac{2}{3}AD\\) and \\(BG = \\frac{2}{3}BE\\).\n\nSince \\(\\triangleAGB\\) is equilateral, we have \\(AG = BG\\).

Using the fact that the centroid divides the medians in a 2:1 ratio, we can use the properties of the centroid and the equilateral triangle to find the relationship between the sides. The length of the median in an equilateral triangle is \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\) times the side length. Therefore, the length of the medians \\(AD\\) and \\(BE\\) in \\(\\triangle ABC\\) must be such that they form an equilateral triangle at the centroid.\n\nBy the properties of the centroid and the equilateral triangle, we can deduce that the cosine of angle \\(C\\) in \\(\\triangle ABC\\) is \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\).

The probability that \\( x_1 + x_2 + x_3 > 1 \\) given that \\( t_1 + t_2 + t_3 \\leq 1 \\) is the volume of the region in the unit cube \\((0,1) \\times (0,1) \\times (0,1)\\) where \\( x_1 + x_2 + x_3 > 1 \\) and \\( t_1 + t_2 + t_3 \\leq 1 \\). This is the volume of the region above the plane \\( x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = 1 \\) and below the plane \\( t_1 + t_2 + t_3 = 1 \\), which is a tetrahedron with volume \\(\\frac{1}{6} \\times \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{1}{36}\\). Therefore, the probability that she stops after the third step and her position is greater than 1 is \\(\\frac{1}{6} \\times \\frac{1}{36} = \\frac{1}{216}\\).\n\nAdding up the probabilities from all cases, we get:\n\\[\n0 + \\frac{1}{8} + \\frac{1}{216} = \\frac{27}{216} + \\frac{1}{216} = \\frac{28}{216} = \\frac{7}{54}\n\\]\nThe denominator plus the numerator of the probability is \\(54 + 7 = 61\\).\n\nThus, the answer is \\(\\boxed{61}\\)."

The side length of the square is 1, so the area of the square is:\n\\[ 1 \\times 1 = 1. \\]\n\nNext, we need to find the area of one of the hexagons. A regular hexagon can be divided into 6 equilateral triangles. The side length of each equilateral triangle is the same as the side length of the hexagon.

Let's list all the factor pairs of 36:\n\\[ (1, 36), (-1, -36), (2, 18), (-2, -18), (3, 12), (-3, -12), (4, 9), (-4, -9), (6, 6), (-6, -6) \\]\n\nHowever, we are only interested in the pairs where \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) are distinct. Therefore, we exclude the pair \\((6, 6)\\) and \\((-6, -6)\\). The remaining pairs are:\n\\[ (1, 36), (-1, -36), (2, 18), (-2, -18), (3, 12), (-3, -12), (4, 9), (-4, -9) \\]\n\nFor each pair \\((p, q)\\), the value of \\( k \\) is given by \\( k = -(p + q) \\). Let's calculate \\( k \\) for each pair:\n\\[ (1, 36) \\implies k = -(1 + 36) = -37 \\]\n\\[ (-1, -36) \\implies k = -(-1 - 36) = 37 \\]\n\\[ (2, 18) \\implies k = -(2 + 18) = -20 \\]\n\\[ (-2, -18) \\implies k = -(-2 - 18) = 20 \\]\n\\[ (3, 12) \\implies k = -(3 + 12) = -15 \\]\n\\[ (-3, -12) \\implies k = -(-3 - 12) = 15 \\]\n\\[ (4, 9) \\implies k = -(4 + 9) = -13 \\]\n\\[ (-4, -9) \\implies k = -(-4 - 9) = 13 \\]\n\nThus, the possible values of \\( k \\) are \\( -37, 37, -20, 20, -15, 15, -13, 13 \\). These are all distinct values.\n\nTherefore, the number of values of \\( k \\) for which the polynomial \\( x^2 + kx + 36 \\) has two distinct integer roots is \\(\\boxed{8}\\)."

            "To determine how many of the given sets contain exactly two multiples of 7, we first need to understand the distribution of multiples of 7 within each set. Each set consists of 10 consecutive integers, and we need to find out how many of these sets contain exactly two multiples of 7.\n\nA set of 10 consecutive integers will contain exactly two multiples of 7 if and only if the first integer in the set is not a multiple of 7, and the set spans exactly two multiples of 7. This means that the first multiple of 7 in the set must be such that the next multiple of 7 (which is 7 more than the first) is also within the set, but the one after that (which is 14 more than the first) is not within the set.\n\nLet's denote the first integer in the set by \\( n \\). The set is then \\(\\{n, n+1, n+2, \\ldots, n+9\\}\\). For this set to contain exactly two multiples of 7, \\( n \\) must be such that \\( n \\) is not a multiple of 7, but \\( n+7 \\) is a multiple of 7, and \\( n+14 \\) is not a multiple of 7. This means \\( n \\) must be of the form \\( 7k + r \\) where \\( r \\) is one of the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 (since \\( n \\) is not a multiple of 7, \\( r \\) cannot be 0).\n\nNow, we need to count how many such sets there are. The sets range from \\(\\{1, 2, \\ldots, 10\\}\\) to \\(\\{991, 992, \\ldots, 1000\\}\\). We need to find the range of \\( n \\) such that the set \\(\\{n, n+1, \\ldots, n+9\\}\\) contains exactly two multiples of 7.\n\nThe smallest \\( n \\) that fits this criterion is 1 (since \\(\\{1, 2, \\ldots, 10\\}\\) contains 1 and 8, which are the multiples of 7). The largest \\( n \\) that fits this criterion is 993 (since \\(\\{993, 994, \\ldots, 999\\}\\) contains 994 and 995, which are the multiples of 7).\n\nSo, \\( n \\) ranges from 1 to 993, but we need to exclude the numbers that are multiples of 7. The multiples of 7 in this range are 7, 14, 21, ..., 994. This is an arithmetic sequence with the first term 7 and the last term 994, and the number of terms in this sequence is \\(\\frac{994}{7} = 142\\).\n\nTherefore, the number of integers from 1 to 993 that are not multiples of 7 is \\(993 - 142 = 851\\). However, we need to count only the numbers of the form \\(7k + r\\) where \\(r\\) is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. This means we need to count the numbers in the range 1 to 993 that are congruent to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 modulo 7. This is exactly one-sixth of the numbers from 1 to 993, because the numbers are uniformly distributed among the residues modulo 7.\n\nSo, the number of such sets is \\(\\frac{993 - 142}{6} = \\frac{851}{6} = 141.8333\\), but since we are dealing with whole sets, we round down to the nearest whole number, which is 142.\n\nThus, the number of sets that contain exactly two multiples of 7 is \\(\\boxed{42}\\)."

Since \\(e\\) must be a positive integer, \\(c\\) must be at least 16. If \\(c = 16\\), then \\(e = 16 - 15 = 1\\), but this is not possible because \\(e\\) must be greater than or equal to \\(c\\). Therefore, we try the next possible value for \\(c\\), which is 17:\n\\[ e = 17 - 15 = 2 \\]\nSo, the numbers are \\(19, 19, 17, 18, 2\\).

This means:\n\n\\[\n\\log_{10}x = 1 - 2 \\log_{10}17 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad \\log_{10}x = -\\log_{10}7\n\\]\n\nSo, \\(x = 10^{1 - 2 \\log_{10}17} = 10^{1} \\cdot 10^{-2 \\log_{10}17} = \\frac{10}{17^2} = \\frac{10}{289}\\) or \\(x = 10^{-\\log_{10}7} = \\frac{1}{7}\\).\n\nThe product of the solutions is:\n\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{10}{289}\\right) \\left(\\frac{1}{7}\\right) = \\frac{10}{2023}\n\\]\n\nThus, the product of all solutions to the equation is \\(\\boxed{\\frac{1}{7}}\\)."

First, we count the number of pairs \\((Q, R)\\) such that \\(d(Q, R) = 1\\), \\(d(Q, R) = 2\\), \\(d(Q, R) = 3\\), and \\(d(Q, R) = 4\\).\n\n- There are 12 vertices, and each vertex is connected to 5 other vertices by an edge, so there are \\(12 \\times 5 \/ 2 = 30\\) edges (i.e., pairs \\((Q, R)\\) such that \\(d(Q, R) = 1\\)).\n- For each vertex \\(Q\\), there are 5 vertices at distance 2 (the vertices connected to the 5 vertices adjacent to \\(Q\\) but not equal to \\(Q\\)).

            "To determine how many dates in 2023 will have each digit appearing an even number of times in the 8-digit display, we need to analyze the structure of the date format, which is YMMDD, where Y is the year, M is the month, and D is the day.\n\nThe year 2023 has the digits 2, 0, 2, and 3. The month M can range from 01 to 12, and the day D can range from 01 to 31. We need to ensure that each digit in the 8-digit number YMMDD appears an even number of times.\n\nFirst, let's list the digits we have: 2, 0, 2, 3, M1, M2, D1, D2. We need to count the occurrences of each digit and ensure they are all even.\n\n1. The digit 2 appears at least twice (from the year 2023).\n2. The digit 0 appears at least once (from the year 2023).\n3. The digit 3 appears at most once (from the year 2023).\n4. The digits M1, M2, D1, and D2 must be such that each digit in the entire 8-digit number appears an even number of times.\n\nSince the digit 3 can only appear at most once, M and D must be chosen such that the digit 3 does not appear in M or D. This means M and D must be chosen from the months and days that do not include the digit 3. The months that do not include the digit 3 are 04, 05, 06, 07, 08, 09, 10, 11, and the days that do not include the digit 3 are 01, 02, 04, 05, 06, 07, 08, 09, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, and 31 (excluding the days that include the digit 3).\n\nHowever, we need to ensure that the total count of each digit is even. Let's analyze the possible values for M and D:\n\n- If M is 04, 05, 06, 07, 08, 09, 10, 11, the digit 0 appears once, which is odd. So, M cannot be one of these months.\n- If M is 01, 02, 04, 05, 06, 07, 08, 09, 10, 11, the digit 0 appears once, which is odd. So, M cannot be one of these months either.\n\nThe only months that do not include the digit 0 are 11. So, M must be 11. Now, we need to choose D such that the digit 3 does not appear in D and the total count of each digit is even. The possible values for D are 01, 02, 04, 05, 06, 07, 08, 09, 10, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31 (excluding the days that include the digit 3).\n\nWe need to count the number of valid D values. The valid days are 01, 02, 04, 05, 06, 07, 08, 09, 10, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31. There are 26 valid days.\n\nTherefore, the number of valid dates in 2023 is 1 (for M = 11) * 26 (for D) = 26.\n\nThe answer is \\(\\boxed{12}\\)."

The greatest common divisor (gcd) of 6 and 10 is 2, so they are not coprime. The gcd of 6 and 15 is 3, so they are not coprime. The gcd of 10 and 15 is 5, so they are not coprime. Since no two of the coin values are coprime, we need to use a different approach.\n\nWe will use the fact that the largest number that cannot be formed using the coin values 6, 10, and 15 can be found by checking the numbers manually or using a systematic approach.

This means there are \\( n+1 \\) possible values for \\( a \\), \\( n+1 \\) possible values for \\( b \\), and 1 possible value for \\( c \\). Therefore, the total number of possible products is:\n\\[ (n+1)(n+1) \\cdot 1 = (n+1)^2 \\]\n\nWe are given that the number of possible values of the product is 936. So, we need to solve the equation:\n\\[ (n+1)^2 = 936 \\]\n\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get:\n\\[ n+1 = \\sqrt{936} \\]\n\\[ n+1 = 30.6 \\]\n\nSince \\( n \\) must be an integer, we round 30.6 to the nearest whole number, which is 31. Therefore:\n\\[ n+1 = 31 \\]\n\\[ n = 30 \\]\n\nTo verify, we check if \\( (30+1)^2 = 936 \\):\n\\[ 31^2 = 961 \\]\n\nSince 961 is slightly more than 936, we need to check if \\( n = 29 \\) might work:\n\\[ (29+1)^2 = 30^2 = 900 \\]\n\nSince 900 is less than 936, the correct value of \\( n \\) must be 30. Therefore, the value of \\( n \\) is:\n\\[ \\boxed{3} \\]"

We need to analyze the sign of the expression \\(\\frac{x(2 - x)}{x - 3}\\) over the intervals determined by the roots \\(x = 0\\), \\(x = 2\\), and \\(x = 3\\).\n\nWe can use a sign chart to determine where the expression is non-negative:\n\n- For \\(x < 0\\), \\(x(2 - x) > 0\\) and \\(x - 3 < 0\\), so \\(\\frac{x(2 - x)}{x - 3} < 0\\).\n- For \\(0 < x < 2\\), \\(x(2 - x) > 0\\) and \\(x - 3 < 0\\), so \\(\\frac{x(2 - x)}{x - 3} < 0\\).\n- For \\(2 < x < 3\\), \\(x(2 - x) < 0\\) and \\(x - 3 < 0\\), so \\(\\frac{x(2 - x)}{x - 3} > 0\\).\n- For \\(x > 3\\), \\(x(2 - x) < 0\\) and \\(x - 3 > 0\\), so \\(\\frac{x(2 - x)}{x - 3} < 0\\).\n\nThus, the expression \\(\\frac{x(2 - x)}{x - 3} \\geq 0\\) when \\(2 \\leq x < 3\\). Since \\(x = \\log n\\), we need \\(2 \\leq \\log n < 3\\). This translates to:\n\n\\[\n10^2 \\leq n < 10^3 \\implies 100 \\leq n < 1000\n\\]\n\nThe integers \\(n\\) that satisfy this inequality are \\(100, 101, 102, \\ldots, 999\\). To find the number of integers in this range, we calculate:\n\n\\[\n999 - 100 + 1 = 900\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of integers \\(n\\) for which the given expression represents a real number is \\(\\boxed{900}\\)."
