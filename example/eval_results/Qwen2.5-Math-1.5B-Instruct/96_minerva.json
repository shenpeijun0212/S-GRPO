The characteristic equation for this homogeneous equation is:\n\\[ s^4 - 1 = 0. \\]\nThis can be factored as:\n\\[ (s^2 - 1)(s^2 + 1) = 0, \\]\nwhich gives the roots:\n\\[ s = \\pm 1, \\pm i. \\]\nThe homogeneous solution is therefore:\n\\[ x_h(t) = C_1 e^t + C_2 e^{-t} + C_3 \\cos t + C_4 \\sin t. \\]\n\n### Step 2: Find the particular solution\nWe need to find a particular solution to the non-homogeneous equation \\(\\frac{d^4 x}{dt^4} - x = e^{-2t}\\). Since the right-hand side is \\(e^{-2t}\\), we assume a particular solution of the form:\n\\[ x_p(t) = A e^{-2t}. \\]\nWe need to find the value of \\(A\\).

            "To solve the problems, we need to determine the age of the universe at different points in its history and express these ages in the requested units. Let's go through each subproblem step by step.\n\n### Subproblem 0: Age of our universe when most He nuclei were formed in minutes\n\nThe age of the universe when most hydrogen atoms were formed is approximately 10 minutes. We need to round this to the nearest power of 10. The powers of 10 are 1, 10, 100, 1000, etc. Since 10 minutes is closer to 10 than to 100, we round it to the nearest power of 10, which is 10.\n\nSo, the age of the universe when most He nuclei were formed is \\(\\boxed{1}\\) minute.\n\n### Subproblem 1: Age of our universe when hydrogen atoms formed in years\n\nThe age of the universe when hydrogen atoms formed is approximately 13.8 billion years. We need to express this in years. Since 13.8 billion is already in years, we can write it as 13,800,000,000 years. However, the problem asks for the answer in years, so we can simply write it as 13,800,000,000.\n\nSo, the age of the universe when hydrogen atoms formed is \\(\\boxed{13800000000}\\) years.\n\n### Subproblem 2: Age of our universe today in Gyr\n\nThe current age of the universe is approximately 13.8 billion years. We need to express this in Gyr (gigayears). Since 1 billion years is equal to 1000 million years, 13.8 billion years is equal to 13.8 million years.

Let's go through each subproblem step by step.\n\n### Subproblem 0: Age of our universe when most He nuclei were formed in minutes\nThe age of the universe when most hydrogen atoms were formed is approximately 13.8 billion years. To convert this into minutes, we use the following conversions:\n1 year = 365.25 days (average year)\n1 day = 24 hours\n1 hour = 60 minutes\n\nSo, the age in minutes is:\n\\[ 13.8 \\text{ billion years} = 13.8 \\times 10^9 \\text{ years} \\]\n\\[ 13.8 \\times 10^9 \\text{ years} \\times 365.25 \\text{ days\/year} \\times 24 \\text{ hours\/day} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes\/hour} \\approx 4.3 \\times 10^{17} \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nRounding to the nearest power of 10, we get:\n\\[ 4.3 \\times 10^{17} \\approx 10^{18} \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nHowever, the problem asks for the age in minutes to the nearest power of 10, and the closest power of 10 to 4.3 x 10^17 is 10^18. So the answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{1} \\text{ minute} \\]\n\n### Subproblem 1: Age of our universe when hydrogen atoms formed in years\nThe age of the universe when hydrogen atoms formed is approximately 13.8 billion years. To the nearest power of 10, this is:\n\\[ 13.8 \\times 10^9 \\approx 10^{10} \\text{ years} \\]\n\nSo the answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{400000} \\text{ years} \\]\n\n### Subproblem 2: Age of our universe today in Gyr\nThe age of the universe today is approximately 13.8 billion years. To convert this into Gyr (gigayears), we use the following conversion:\n1 G year = 10^9 years\n\nSo, the age in Gyr is:\n\\[ 13.8 \\text{ billion years} = 13.8 \\times 10^9 \\text{ years} \\]\n\\[ 13.8 \\times 10^9 \\text{ years} \\div 10^9 \\text{ years\/G year} = 13.8 \\text{ G year} \\]\n\nRounding to the nearest power of 10, we get:\n\\[ 13.8 \\approx 10 \\text{ G year} \\]\n\nSo the answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\text{ G year} \\]\n\n### Subproblem 3: Number of stars in our galaxy ( Please format your answer as 'xen' representing \\(x \\times 10^n\\))\nThe number of stars in our galaxy is approximately 100 billion. To format this as \\(x \\times 10^n\\), we have:\n\\[ 100 \\text{ billion} = 100 \\times 10^9 = 1 \\times 10^{11} \\]\n\nSo the answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{1e11} \\]\n\n### Subproblem 4: Light travel time to closest star (Sun!!) in minutes. (Please format your answer as an integer)\nThe distance to the closest star ( our sun ) is approximately 4.24 light years.

            "To determine the age of the universe when most hadrons were formed in minutes, we need to use the current age of the universe and the time it took for hadrons to form. The current age of the universe is approximately 13.8 billion years. The hadrons were formed when the temperature of the universe was high enough to allow hadrons to form, which is around 1 second after the big expansion.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the age of the universe from years to seconds. There are 365.25 days in a year, 24 hours in a day, 60 minutes in an hour, and 60 seconds in a minute. Therefore, the number of seconds in a year is:\n\n\\[ 365.25 \\times 24 \\times 60 \\times 60 = 31,557,600 \\text{ seconds} \\]\n\nSo, the age of the universe in seconds is:\n\n\\[ 13.8 \\times 10^9 \\text{ years} \\times 31,557,600 \\text{ seconds\/year} = 432,452,448,000,000 \\text{ seconds} \\]\n\nNext, we need to convert this time into minutes.

The number 7,207,540,800,000 is between \\(10^7\\) and \\(10^8\\). To determine which power of 10 it is closer to, we can compare it to \\(10^7 = 10,000,000\\) and \\(10^8 = 100,000,000\\). Since 7,207,540,800,000 is closer to \\(10^8\\) than to \\(10^7\\), we round it to \\(10^8\\).\n\nTherefore, the age of the universe when most hadrons were formed is approximately:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{7.2 \\times 10^8 \\text{ minutes}} \\]"

            "To solve the problem, we need to understand the relationship between the speed of the baseball player and the angle he sees from third base. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the speed of Manny Relativize\nManny Relativity hits the ball and starts running towards first base at speed \\(\\beta\\). He sees third base at an angle of \\(45^\\circ\\) to his left. This means that the angle between his direction of running and the line from third base to his current position is \\(45^\\circ\\).\n\nIn special relativity, the observed angle \\(\\theta'\\) is related to the actual angle \\(\\theta\\) by the formula:\n\\[\n\\cos \\theta' = \\frac{\\cos \\theta - \\beta}{1 - \\beta \\cos \\theta}\n\\]\nHere, \\(\\theta = 45^\\circ\\) and \\(\\cos 45^\\circ = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\). Substituting these values into the formula, we get:\n\\[\n\\cos \\theta' = \\frac{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} - \\beta}{1 - \\beta \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}}\n\\]\nWe are given that \\(\\cos \\theta' = -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\).

The given solution is \\(\\beta = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\). Let's verify this by substituting \\(\\beta = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\) back into the original formula:\n\\[\n\\cos \\theta' = \\frac{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}}{1 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}} = \\frac{0}{1 - \\frac{1}{2}} = 0\n\\]\nThis is not correct. Let's recheck the problem statement and the given solution. The correct solution should be \\(\\beta = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\).\n\n### Step 2: Determine the wavelength of light seen by Manny\nThe wavelength of light seen by Manny is given by the formula for length contration in special relativity:\n\\[\n\\lambda' = \\lambda_{\\text{red}} \\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}\n\\]\nSubstituting \\(\\beta = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\):\n\\[\n\\lambda' = \\lambda_{\\text{red}} \\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)^2} = \\lambda_{\\text{red}} \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2}} = \\lambda_{\\text{red}} \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}} = \\lambda_{\\text{red}} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\n\\]\nSo, the wavelength of light seen by Manny is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\lambda_{\\text{red}}}\n\\]"

            "To solve for the energy \\( E_{\\nu} \\) of the ver non in the rest frame of the deutron, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the rest frame of the deutron**: In this frame, the deutron is at rest, so its total energy is simply its rest mass energy, \\( E_d = m_d c^2 \\). The rest mass of the deutron is \\( m_d = m_p + m_p - m_e - m_{\\nu} \\approx 2m_p \\) (since \\( m_e \\approx 0 \\) and \\( m_{\\nu} \\approx 0 \\)).\n\n2. **Determine the total energy in the lab frame**: In the lab frame, the two protons have the same energy \\( \\gamma m_p \\) and impact angle \\( \\theta \\). The total energy of the two protons is \\( 2 \\gamma m_p \\). The electron is at rest, so its energy is \\( m_e \\approx 0 \\). The total energy in the lab frame is therefore \\( 2 \\gamma m_p \\).\n\n3. **Relate the total energy in the lab frame to the rest frame of the deutron**: The total energy in the lab frame is the same as the total energy in the rest frame of the deutron, because the total energy is a Lorentz invariant. Therefore, the total energy in the rest frame of the deutron is also \\( 2 \\gamma m_p \\).\n\n4. **Calculate the energy of the ver non in the rest frame of the deutron**: In the rest frame of the deutron, the total energy is \\( 2 \\gamma m_p \\). The energy of the ver non is the total energy minus the energy of the electron (which is zero in the rest frame of the ver non) and the energy of the muon (which is also zero in the rest frame of the ver non). Therefore, the energy of the ver non is simply the rest mass energy of the ver non, which is \\( 2m_p \\).\n\nHowever, we need to express this energy in terms of the given variables. The energy of the ver non in the rest frame of the ver non is simply the rest mass energy of the ver non, which is \\( 2m_p \\). But we need to express this in terms of the given variables \\( \\theta, m_p, \\) and \\( \\gamma \\).\n\nThe energy of the ver non in the rest frame of the ver non is given by the total energy in the rest frame of the ver non, which is \\( 2 \\gamma m_p \\), minus the energy of the muon, which is zero in the rest frame of the ver non. Therefore, the energy of the ver non is simply the rest mass energy of the ver non, which is \\( 2m_p \\).\n\nSo the energy of the ver non in the rest frame of the ver non is:\n\n\\[\nE_{\\nu} = 2m_p\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the energy of the ver non in the rest frame of the ver non is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{2m_p}\n\\]"

When NaA is added to water, it dissociates into Na+ and A- ions. The A- ion is the conjugate base of the weak acid argon, and it will hydrolyze in water to produce OH- ions. The net effect is that the solution will have a net negative charge because the OH- ions are produced, which are not counterbalanced by cations like Na+.\n\n3. **Calculate the net charge**: The net charge of the solution will be determined by the charge of the cations and anions present.

            "To determine the wavelength of the photoemission generated by the interaction of the EM radiation with the Germanium crystal, we can use the relationship between the frequency of the EM radiation, the work function of the material, and the wavelength of the photoemission. The relationship is given by the equation:\n\n\\[ E = \\frac{c}{\\lambda} \\]\n\nwhere \\( E \\) is the energy of the EM radian, \\( c \\) is the speed of light, and \\( \\lambda \\) is the wavelength of the EM radian. The energy of the EM radian can also be expressed in terms of its frequency as:\n\n\\[ E = h \\cdot f \\]\n\nwhere \\( h \\) is Planck's constant and \\( f \\) is the frequency of the EM radian. By equating the two expressions for energy, we get:\n\n\\[ h \\cdot f = \\frac{c}{\\lambda} \\]\n\nRearranging this equation to solve for the wavelength \\( \\lambda \\), we get:\n\n\\[ \\lambda = \\frac{c}{h \\cdot f} \\]\n\nWe are given the frequency \\( f = 3.091 \\times 10^{14} \\) Hz, Planck's constant \\( h = 6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\) J\u00b7s, and the speed of light \\( c = 3.00 \\times 10^8 \\) m\/s.

Let's recheck the calculation of the energy in eV. The band gap of Germanium is 0.7 eV, which means the work function of Germanium is 0.7 eV. The energy of the EM radian in eV is:\n\n\\[ E = 3.091 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ Hz} \\cdot 6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J\u00b7s} \/ 1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ J\/eV} = 1.287 \\text{ eV} \\]\n\nThe energy of the EM radian is greater than the band gap of Germanium, so photoemission will occur. The wavelength of the photoemission is given by:\n\n\\[ \\lambda = \\frac{1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ J}}{1.287 \\text{ eV} \\cdot 1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ J\/eV}} = 0.7 \\text{ m} \\]\n\nSo the correct answer is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0.70} \\]"

There is one oxygen atom in \\(\\mathrm{O}_2\\) on the left side and two oxygen atoms in \\(\\mathrm{CO}_2\\) on the right side.

The carbon atoms are already balanced, but the oxygen atoms are not. We need to adjust the coefficients to balance the oxygen atoms. We can see that the equation is already balanced with the coefficients we have:\n\n\\[\n2\\mathrm{CO} + \\mathrm{O}_2 \\rightarrow 2\\mathrm{CO}_2\n\\]\n\nHowever, we need to balance the equation properly. We need to have the same number of oxygen atoms on both sides.

            "To determine how many different [110]-type directions lie in the (111) plane in an cubic unit cell (U cell), we need to understand the relationship between the plane and the direction in the context of the cubic lattice.\n\n1. **Identify the plane and direction**: The (111) plane in a cubic unit cell is defined by the equation \\(x + y + z = 0\\). The [110] type direction is a direction with a [110] miller index, meaning it has components of 1 along the x-axis, 1 along the y-axis, and 0 along the z-axis.\n\n2. **Determine the intersection**: We need to find out how many such [110] directions lie within the (111) plane. This involves finding the intersection of the plane \\(x + y + z = 0\\) with the direction [110]. The [110] direction can be represented by the vector \\((1, 1, 0)\\).\n\n3. **Check the plane equation**: Substitute the components of the [110] direction into the plane equation:\n   \\[\n   1 + 1 + 0 = 2 \\neq 0\n   \\]\n   This shows that the [110] direction does not lie in the (111) plane. However, we need to find the directions that do lie in the plane. The [110] type directions in the plane can be represented as \\((a, a, -2a)\\) where \\(a\\) is a non-zero scalar. This is because the plane equation \\(x + y + z = 0\\) is satisfied for any \\(a\\).\n\n4. **Count the unique directions**: The [110] type directions in the plane are of the form \\((a, a, -2a)\\). Since the direction is defined up to a scalar multiple, we can consider the direction \\((1, 1, -2)\\) as a representative. There is only one unique direction of this type in the plane.\n\nTherefore, the number of different [110]-type directions that lie in the (111) plane is \\(\\boxed{3}\\). This is because the [110] type directions in the plane can be represented as \\((a, a, -2a)\\), \\((a, -a, 0)\\), and \\((-a, a, 0)\\), which are three unique directions."

Calculate the planar packing fraction.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the lattice parameter of aluminum\nThe lattice parameter of aluminum (Al) is approximately \\( a = 4.04 \\) Angstrons.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the number of atoms in the (110) plane\nThe (110) plane in a cubic lattice of aluminum contains 2 atoms. This is because the plane intersects the lattice along two lattice points and does not include any other lattice points in its interior.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the area of the (110) plane\nThe area of the (110) plane is the area of a rectangle with sides equal to the lattice parameter \\( a \\) and the distance between the two atoms along the (110) plane.

            "To determine the frequency of light with a wavelength of \\(408 \\text{ nm}\\), we start with the relationship between the speed of light, the wavelength, and the frequency:\n\n\\[ c = \\lambda v \\]\n\nwhere \\( c \\) is the speed of light, \\( \\lambda \\) is the wavelength, and \\( v \\) is the frequency. Rearranging for frequency, we get:\n\n\\[ v = \\frac{c}{\\lambda} \\]\n\nThe speed of light \\( c \\) is \\( 3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m\/s} \\) and the wavelength \\( \\lambda \\) is \\( 408 \\text{ nm} \\). Since \\( 1 \\text{ nm} = 10^{-9} \\text{ m} \\), we can convert the wavelength to meters:\n\n\\[ \\lambda = 408 \\text{ nm} = 408 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ m} = 4.08 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m} \\]\n\nNow, substituting the values into the frequency formula:\n\n\\[ v = \\frac{3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m\/s}}{4.08 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}} \\]\n\nTo simplify the division, we can rewrite it as:\n\n\\[ v = \\frac{3 \\times 10^8}{4.08 \\times 10^{-7}} = \\frac{3}{4.08} \\times 10^{8-(-7)} = \\frac{3}{4.08} \\times 10^{15} \\]\n\nCalculating the fraction \\(\\frac{3}{4.08}\\):\n\n\\[ \\frac{3}{4.08} \\approx 0.7353 \\]\n\nSo, the frequency is:\n\n\\[ v \\approx 0.7353 \\times 10^{15} = 7.353 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ s}^{-1} \\]\n\nThus, the frequency is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{7.353 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ s}^{-1}} \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine the wave number.

Vanadium is a cubic close packs (CCP) or face-centered cubic (FCC) structure, which means each vanadate atom is surrounded by 12 other vanadate atoms.\n\nThe linear density of atoms in a cubic close packs structure can be calculated by considering the distance between the centers of two adjacent atoms. In a cubic close packs structure, the distance between the centers of two adjacent atoms (the edge length of the cube divided by the number of atoms along the edge) is equal to the diameter of one vanadate atom.\n\nThe edge length of the unit cell in a cubic close packs structure is equal to \\( \\frac{4r}{\\sqrt{3}} \\), where \\( r \\) is the radius of the vanadate atom. The linear density of atoms is the number of atoms per unit length along the edge of the unit cell.

            "To determine the algebraic condition that describes a firm that is at an output level that maximizes its profits given its capital in the short-term, we need to use some basic principles from microeconmetry, particularly the concept of profit maximization.\n\n1. **Define the profit function**: The profit function for a firm is given by the difference between its total revenue (TR) and its total cost (TC). If we let \\( P \\) be the price per unit of output, \\( Q \\) be the quantity of output, \\( R \\) be the revenue function, \\( C \\) be the cost function, and \\( \\pi \\) be the profit function, then the profit function can be written as:\n   \\[\n   \\pi = R(Q) - C(Q)\n   \\]\n   where \\( R(Q) = P \\cdot Q \\) (since price is constant in the short-run) and \\( C(Q) \\) is the cost function which typically includes both variable and fixed costs.\n\n2. **First-order condition for profit maximization**: To find the output level that maximizes profit, we need to take the derivative of the profit function with respect to quantity \\( Q \\) and set it equal to zero. This is because at the profit\u6700\u5927\u5316 output level, the slope of the profit function (which is the difference between the slopes of the revenue and cost functions) is zero.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d\\pi}{dQ} = \\frac{dR(Q)}{dQ} - \\frac{dC(Q)}{dQ} = P - MC(Q) = 0\n   \\]\n   where \\( MC(Q) \\) is the marginal cost, which is the derivative of the cost function with respect to quantity.\n\n3. **Solve for the profit\u6700\u5927\u5316 output**: The equation \\( P - MC(Q) = 0 \\) can be rearranged to give:\n   \\[\n   P = MC(Q)\n   \\]\n   This condition states that the price per unit of output is equal to the marginal cost of producing that unit of output. This is the condition that must be satisfied for a firm to be at an output level that maximizes its profits.\n\n4. **Use standard acronym**: The standard acronym for \"marginal cost\" is \"MC\". Therefore, the algebraic condition that describes a firm that is at an output level that maximizes its profits given its capital in the short-term is:\n   \\[\n   \\boxed{P = MC}\n   \\]"

The ground state structure of benzene is a planar ring with alternating single and double bonds. The Hund's rule states that the lowest energy configuration is the one with the maximum number of parallel electrons in the same energy level. For benzene, this means the double bonds are not exactly equal but are slightly different due to the overlap of the p orbitals.\n\nThe ground state energy of benzene can be calculated using the Hund's rule energy levels. The energy levels for benzene are as follows:\n\n1. The energy of the 1s orbitals of the two carbon atoms.\n2. The energy of the 2s orbitals of the two carbon atoms.\n3. The energy of the 2p orbitals of the two carbon atoms, which include the pi bonds.\n4. The energy of the 3p orbitals of the two carbon atoms, which include the double bonds.\n\nThe ground state energy of benzene is approximately -3.5 eV. This value is derived from the sum of the energies of the occupied orbitals minus the sum of the energies of the unoccupied orbitals.\n\nNext, we need to determine the ground state energy of benzene with one electron removed. When one electron is removed, the system becomes an open system, and the energy of the system is lower because the electron is no longer bound to the molecule. The energy of the system with one electron removed is approximately -3.4 eV. This value is derived from the sum of the energies of the occupied orbitals minus the sum of the energies of the unoccupied orbitals, minus the energy of the removed electron.\n\nNow, we can calculate the ionization potential:\n\n\\[ \\text{IP} = E(\\text{B}^+) - E(\\text{B}) = -3.4 \\text{ eV} - (-3.5 \\text{ eV}) = 0.1 \\text{ eV} \\]\n\nTherefore, the ionization potential of benzene is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1.4} \\]"

            "To find the equation of the demand curve for steel, we need to use the information given about the price, quantity, and the price elasticity of demand. The general form of a linear demand curve is:\n\n\\[ Q_d = a - bP \\]\n\nwhere \\( Q_d \\) is the quantity demanded, \\( P \\) is the price, \\( a \\) is the intercept, and \\( b \\) is the slope of the demand curve.
