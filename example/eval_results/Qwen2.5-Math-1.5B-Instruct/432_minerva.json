This involves the concept of the critical angle, which is the angle of incidence in the water for which the angle of refraction in the air is 90 degrees.

Here, the light is incident on the water surface from air, and it exits into air. The index of refraction of air is approximately 1, and the index of refraction of water is 1.3. Therefore, Snell's law can be written as:\n\n\\[ 1 \\cdot \\sin \\theta_w = 1.3 \\cdot \\sin \\theta_a \\]\n\nRearranging to solve for \\(\\theta_a\\), we get:\n\n\\[ \\sin \\theta_a = \\frac{\\sin \\theta_w}{1.3} \\]\n\nTaking the arcsine of both sides, we obtain:\n\n\\[ \\theta_a = \\arcsin \\left( \\frac{\\sin \\theta_w}{1.3} \\right) \\]\n\nSo the expression for \\(\\theta_a\\) in terms of \\(\\theta_w\\) is:\n\n\\[ \\theta_a = \\arcsin \\left( \\frac{\\sin \\theta_w}{1.3} \\right) \\]\n\n### Subproblem 1: Finding the critical angle\n\nThe critical angle is the angle of incidence in the water for which the angle of refraction in the air is 90 degrees. At this angle, the light is just starting to total internal reflection. Using Snell's law again, we have:\n\n\\[ 1 \\cdot \\sin \\theta_c = 1.3 \\cdot \\sin 90^\\circ \\]\n\nSince \\(\\sin 90^\\circ = 1\\), this simplifies to:\n\n\\[ \\sin \\theta_c = 1.3 \\]\n\nHowever, the sine of an angle cannot be greater than 1. Therefore, the critical angle \\(\\theta_c\\) is the angle whose sine is 1, which is 90 degrees, but we need to find the angle whose sine is \\(\\frac{1}{1.3}\\).

            "To determine the mass of the black hole, we can use the relationship between the orbital period, the orbital radius, and the mass of the black hole. The formula for the orbital period \\(T\\) of a star orbiting a black hole is given by:\n\n\\[ T = 2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{r^3}{GM}} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\(T\\) is the orbital period,\n- \\(r\\) is the orbital radius,\n- \\(G\\) is the gravitational constant,\n- \\(M\\) is the mass of the black hole.\n\nWe need to solve for \\(M\\). Rearranging the formula, we get:\n\n\\[ M = \\frac{4\\pi^2 r^3}{GM} \\]\n\nFirst, we need to convert the orbital radius from seconds of arc to kilometers. Since 1 second of arc is approximately \\(3.086 \\times 10^{-18}\\) kilometers (the distance to the Earth in kilometers), the orbital radius \\(r\\) is:\n\n\\[ r = 0.12 \\times 3.086 \\times 10^{-18} \\text{ km} = 3.7032 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ km} \\]\n\nNext, we need to convert the distance to the black hole from kiloparsallars to kilometers. Since 1 kpc is approximately \\(3.086 \\times 10^{16}\\) kilometers, the distance to the black hole is:\n\n\\[ d = 8 \\text{ kpc} = 8 \\times 3.086 \\times 10^{16} \\text{ km} = 2.4688 \\times 10^{17} \\text{ km} \\]\n\nThe gravitational constant \\(G\\) is approximately \\(6.674 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ m}^3 \\text{ kg}^{-1} \\text{ s}^{-2}\\).

            "To determine how fast Manny Relativize is running, we need to analyze the geometry of the situation and use the principles of special relativity.

Therefore, we can write:\n   \\[\n   v_i = iR + sL i + \\frac{1}{sC} v_o\n   \\]\n   Rearranging this equation, we get:\n   \\[\n   v_i = i(R + sL) + \\frac{1}{sC} v_o\n   \\]\n   Solving for \\( i \\), we get:\n   \\[\n   i = \\frac{v_i - \\frac{1}{sC} v_o}{R + sL}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Express \\( v_o \\) in terms of \\( V_i \\):**\n   Substitute the expression for \\( i \\) into the equation for \\( v_o \\):\n   \\[\n   v_o = \\frac{1}{C} \\int i \\, dt = \\frac{1}{C} \\int \\frac{v_i - \\frac{1}{sC} v_o}{R + sL} \\, dt\n   \\]\n   Taking the derivative of both sides with respect to time, we get:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{dv_o}{dt} = \\frac{1}{C} \\frac{d}{dt} \\left( \\int \\frac{v_i - \\frac{1}{sC} v_o}{R + sL} \\, dt \\right) = \\frac{1}{C} \\frac{v_i - \\frac{1}{sC} v_o}{R + sL}\n   \\]\n   This gives us the differential equation:\n   \\[\n   (R + sL) \\frac{dv_o}{dt} + \\frac{1}{sC} v_o = \\frac{v_i}{C}\n   \\]\n   Multiplying through by \\( sC \\) to clear the fraction, we get:\n   \\[\n   sC (R + sL) \\frac{dv_o}{dt} + v_o = \\frac{sC v_i}{C}\n   \\]\n   Simplifying, we get:\n   \\[\n   sC (R + sL) \\frac{dv_o}{dt} + v_o = s v_i\n   \\]\n   Rearranging terms, we get:\n   \\[\n   sC R \\frac{dv_o}{dt} + s^2 C L \\frac{dv_o}{dt} + v_o = s v_i\n   \\]\n   This is a second-order differential equation. To find the transfer function, we take the Laplace transform of both sides, assuming zero initial conditions:\n   \\[\n   sC R s V_o(s) + s^2 C L V_o(s) + V_o(s) = s V_i(s)\n   \\]\n   Factoring out \\( V_o(s) \\) on the left side, we get:\n   \\[\n   V_o(s) (sC R s + s^2 C L + 1) = s V_i(s)\n   \\]\n   Solving for \\( \\frac{V_o(s)}{V_i(s)} \\), we get:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{V_o(s)}{V_i(s)} = \\frac{s}{s^2 C L + s C R + 1}\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the transfer function is:\n   \\[\n   \\boxed{\\frac{1}{s^2 + \\frac{R}{C} s + \\frac{1}{LC}}}\n   \\]"

            "To solve the problem, we need to understand the relationship between the speed of the baseball player and the angle he sees from third base. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the speed of Manny Relativize\nManny Relativize is running towards first base at a speed \\(\\beta\\) such that he sees third base at an angle of \\(45^\\circ\\) to his left. This means that the angle between his direction of motion and the line from third base to his current position is \\(45^\\circ\\).\n\nWe use the velocity addition formula in special relativity to find \\(\\beta\\). The formula for the angle \\(\\theta\\) between the direction of motion and the line of sight is given by:\n\\[\n\\cos \\theta = \\frac{1 - \\beta}{1 + \\beta}\n\\]\nHere, \\(\\theta = 45^\\circ\\), so \\(\\cos 45^\\circ = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\). Substituting this into the formula, we get:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{1 - \\beta}{1 + \\beta}\n\\]\nTo solve for \\(\\beta\\), we cross-multiply:\n\\[\n1 + \\beta = \\sqrt{2}(1 - \\beta)\n\\]\nExpanding and rearranging terms, we get:\n\\[\n1 + \\beta = \\sqrt{2} - \\sqrt{2}\\beta\n\\]\n\\[\n\\beta + \\sqrt{2}\\beta = \\sqrt{2} - 1\n\\]\n\\[\n\\beta(1 + \\sqrt{2}) = \\sqrt{2} - 1\n\\]\n\\[\n\\beta = \\frac{\\sqrt{2} - 1}{1 + \\sqrt{2}}\n\\]\nTo simplify this expression, we multiply the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator:\n\\[\n\\beta = \\frac{(\\sqrt{2} - 1)(1 - \\sqrt{2})}{(1 + \\sqrt{2})(1 - \\sqrt{2})} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2} - 2 - 1 + \\sqrt{2}}{1 - 2} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{2} - 3}{-1} = 3 - 2\\sqrt{2}\n\\]\nHowever, we can also use the given solution directly, which is \\(\\beta = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\). This is a known result from special relativity for this specific angle. So, the speed of Manny Relativize is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}c}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Determine the wavelength Manny sees\nThe wavelength \\(\\lambda\\) of light as seen by an observer moving with velocity \\(v\\) relative to the source is given by the formula:\n\\[\n\\lambda' = \\lambda \\sqrt{\\frac{1 - \\beta}{1 + \\beta}}\n\\]\nHere, \\(\\beta = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\) and \\(\\lambda_{\\text{red}}\\) is the wavelength of the light as seen by the player. Substituting \\(\\beta = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\) into the formula, we get:\n\\[\n\\lambda' = \\lambda_{\\text{red}} \\sqrt{\\frac{1 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}}{1 + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}}} = \\lambda_{\\text{red}} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\frac{\\sqrt{2} - 1}{\\sqrt{2}}}{\\frac{\\sqrt{2} + 1}{\\sqrt{2}}}} = \\lambda_{\\text{red}} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sqrt{2} - 1}{\\sqrt{2} + 1}}\n\\]\nTo simplify the expression inside the square root, we multiply the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator:\n\\[\n\\lambda' = \\lambda_{\\text{red}} \\sqrt{\\frac{(\\sqrt{2} - 1)(\\sqrt{2} - 1)}{(\\sqrt{2} + 1)(\\sqrt{2} - 1)}} = \\lambda_{\\text{red}} \\sqrt{\\frac{2 - 2\\sqrt{2} + 1}{2 - 1}} = \\lambda_{\\text{red}} \\sqrt{3 - 2\\sqrt{2}}\n\\]\nWe know that \\(3 - 2\\sqrt{2} = (\\sqrt{2} - 1)^2\\), so:\n\\[\n\\lambda' = \\lambda_{\\text{red}} \\sqrt{(\\sqrt{2} - 1)^2} = \\lambda_{\\text{red}} (\\sqrt{2} - 1)\n\\]\nTherefore, the wavelength that Manny sees is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{(\\sqrt{2} - 1)\\lambda_{\\text{red}}}\n\\]"

            "To determine the band gap \\(E_g\\) of the pure algebraic material that appears red in transmitted light, we need to follow a step-by-step approach. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Identify the type of material:**\n   - The material is pure and appears red in transmitted light. This indicates that it is a conductor or an insulating material, but not aq valent material.\n   - The key characteristic of the material is that it exhibits a finite band gap. This means that chargecarers (carers) and Fermi- holes ( Fermi holes) are separated by a certain energy range, and light with energies within this range will not be able to move between the band gap.\n   - Since the material appears red in transmitted light, it must be a conductor or an insulating material. However, the band gap is a characteristic of sem conductors, which means it must be a p-type or n-type material.\n\n2. **Determine the band gap energy:**\n   - The band gap energy \\(E_g\\) for a material that appears red in transmitted light is typically around 1.1 eV for a p-type material and 3.4 eV for an n-type material. However, since the material is pure and appears red, it is likely a p-type material with a band gap around 1.1 eV.\n   - To be more precise, we can use the fact that the material is pure and the band gap is finite. The band gap for a pure algebraic material that appears red in transmitted light is typically around 1.1 eV.\n\nTherefore, the approximate band gap \\(E_g\\) for this material is \\(\\boxed{1.1}\\) eV."

Similarly, we can find other vectors by permuting the components and ensuring they satisfy the plane equation. The possible [110] directions in the (111) plane are [11-2], [1-21], and [-211].

Since \\(1 \\text{ nm} = 10^{-9} \\text{ m}\\), we have:\n\n\\[ \\lambda = 408 \\text{ nm} = 408 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ m} = 4.08 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m} \\]\n\nNow, we can substitute the values of \\( c \\) and \\( \\lambda \\) into the equation \\( c = \\lambda \\cdot f \\) and solve for \\( f \\):\n\n\\[ 3.00 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m\/s} = 4.08 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m} \\cdot f \\]\n\nTo isolate \\( f \\), we divide both sides of the equation by \\( 4.08 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m} \\):\n\n\\[ f = \\frac{3.00 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m\/s}}{4.08 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}} \\]\n\nWe can simplify the division of the powers of 10:\n\n\\[ f = \\frac{3.00}{4.08} \\times 10^{8 - (-7)} \\text{ s}^{-1} = \\frac{3.00}{4.08} \\times 10^{15} \\text{ s}^{-1} \\]\n\nNow, we calculate the numerical value of the fraction:\n\n\\[ \\frac{3.00}{4.08} \\approx 0.735 \\]\n\nSo, the frequency is:\n\n\\[ f \\approx 0.735 \\times 10^{15} \\text{ s}^{-1} = 7.35 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ s}^{-1} \\]\n\nTherefore, the frequency of the light is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{7.35 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ s}^{-1}} \\]"

The bond energy of a molecule is related to the electronegativity difference between the atoms in the bond. The general relationship is that the bond energy of a bond between two atoms is proportional to the electronegativity difference between the two atoms. Specifically, the bond energy \\(E\\) can be approximated by the formula:\n\n\\[ E \\approx k \\Delta x \\]\n\nwhere \\(k\\) is a proportionality constant. For simplicity, we can use the fact that the bond energy is approximately proportional to the electronegativity difference. Therefore, we can use the bond energies directly to find the electronegativity differences.\n\nFirst, let's find the electronegativity difference for the system \\({H}-{F}\\). The bond energy of the \\({H}-{F}\\) bond is 565 kJ\/mol. We need to find the electronegativity difference \\(\\Delta x_{HF}\\) such that:\n\n\\[ 565 \\approx k \\Delta x_{HF} \\]\n\nNext, let's find the electronegativity difference for the system \\({C}-{F}\\). The bond energy of the \\({C}-{F}\\) bond is not directly given, but we can use the bond energy of \\({C}-{C}\\) as a reference. The bond energy of \\({C}-{C}\\) is 335 kJ\/mol, and we can assume that the electronegativity difference for a triple bond (which is similar to a \\({C}-{F}\\) bond in terms of electronegativity difference) is approximately the same as the difference for a double bond (which is similar to a \\({H}-{F}\\) bond). Therefore, we can use the bond energy of \\({H}-{F}\\) to estimate the bond energy of \\({C}-{F}\\). However, since the bond energy of \\({C}-{F}\\) is not given, we will use the given bond energy of \\({H}-{F}\\) as a reference and assume a similar proportionality.\n\nNow, let's calculate the difference in electronegativity between \\({H}-{F}\\) and \\({C}-{F}\\):\n\n\\[ \\Delta x_{HF} = \\frac{565}{k} \\]\n\\[ \\Delta x_{CF} = \\frac{565}{k} \\]\n\nSince the bond energy of \\({C}-{F}\\) is not given, we will assume that the electronegativity difference for \\({C}-{F}\\) is similar to that of \\({H}-{F}\\) for the purpose of this calculation. Therefore, the difference in electronegativity between \\({H}-{F}\\) and \\({C}-{F}\\) is:\n\n\\[ \\Delta x = \\Delta x_{HF} - \\Delta x_{CF} = \\frac{565}{k} - \\frac{565}{k} = 0 \\]\n\nHowever, since the bond energy of \\({C}-{F}\\) is not given, we will use the given bond energy of \\({H}-{F}\\) as a reference and assume a similar proportionality. Therefore, the difference in electronegativity between \\({H}-{F}\\) and \\({C}-{F}\\) is:\n\n\\[ \\Delta x = \\frac{565}{335} - \\frac{565}{335} = 0.79 \\]\n\nTherefore, the difference in relative electronegativity \\(\\Delta x\\) in \\(e V\\) for the systems \\({H}-{F}\\) and \\({C}-{F}\\) is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0.79} \\]"

The total demand for apples in a day is 150 apples when the price is 75 cents per apple.\n\nLet's denote the price of apples by \\( p \\) cents. The local orchard will produce up to 50 apples at a price of \\( p \\) cents, and the store will produce the remaining apples at a price of 75 cents per apple. The total quantity of apples produced and sold will be the sum of the apples produced by the orchard and the apples produced by the store.\n\nThe quantity of apples produced by the orchard is 50 if the price \\( p \\) is less than or equal to 75 cents.

This is because if MC is less than AC, the firm can produce more by expanding production, and if MC is greater than AC, the firm can produce less by decreasing production. Therefore, the firm will produce at a level where MC = AC to minimize costs.\n\n2. **Apply this to the long run**: In the long run, the firm can adjust both its output and its capital level. The condition that describes a firm that is at a capital level that minimizes its costs in the long run is that the short-run marginal cost (SRMC) equals the short-run average cost (SRAC). This is because the firm will produce at a level where the additional cost of producing one more unit (SRMC) is equal to the average cost of all units produced (SRAC), which ensures that the cost per unit is minimized.\n\nTherefore, the condition that involves the short-run marginal cost (SRMC) and is related to cost minimization in the long run is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{SRMC = SRAC}\n\\]"

The structure of benzene is a planar ring with alternating single and double bonds. The Hund's rule states that the lowest energy configuration for benzene is the one with the double bonds alternating, which is known as the symmetric pi conjugation.\n\nThe energy of benzene can be calculated using the Hund's rule and the given values of \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\). The energy of a system of conjugated pi electrons can be approximated using the Huckel method. For benzene, the energy of the system can be written as:\n\n\\[ E(\\text{B}) = 6\\alpha + 2\\beta \\]\n\nSubstituting the given values \\(\\alpha = -11.2 \\text{ eV}\\) and \\(\\beta = -0.7 \\text{ eV}\\):\n\n\\[ E(\\text{B}) = 6(-11.2) + 2(-0.7) = -67.2 - 1.4 = -68.6 \\text{ eV} \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine the ground state energy of benzene with one electron removed, \\(E(\\text{B}^+)\\). When one electron is removed, the system becomes an open shell, and the energy of the system will be higher than the ground state of the full molecule.

Therefore, the possible results of the measurement are simply the eigenvalues \\(E_1\\) and \\(E_2\\).\n\nThus, the possible results of the measurement are \\(\\boxed{E_1 \\text{ and } E_2}\\)."
