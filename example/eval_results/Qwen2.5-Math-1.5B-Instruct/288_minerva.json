At the critical angle, the angle of refraction is 90 degrees, meaning the light is just starting to come out of the water. So, we have:\n\n\\[ \\sin \\theta_c = \\frac{n_2}{n_1} \\]\n\nwhere \\( \\theta_c \\) is the critical angle.

A universal function is useful, since using it we can build any function we wish out of a single part. For example, when implementing boolean logic on a computer chip a universal function (called a 'gate' in logic-speak) can simplify design enormously. We would like to find a universal boolean function. In this problem we will denote the two boolean inputs $A$ and $B$ and the one boolean output as $C$. \nFirst, to help us organize our thoughts, let's enumerate all of the functions we'd like to be able to construct. How many different possible one-output boolean functions of two variables are there? I.e., how many functions are there of the form $F(A, B)=C ?$<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

Therefore, the total frictional torque is \\(2B\\omega\\) (since there are two bearings, each contributing \\(B\\omega\\)).\n\n2. **Apply Newton's second law to rotational motion:**\n   The net torque on the rollertor is the sum of the applied torque and the frictional torques. According to Newton's second law for rotation, the net torque is equal to the moment of inertia \\(I\\) times the angular acceleration \\(\\alpha\\).

            "To determine how fast Manny Relativize is running, we need to analyze the geometry of the situation and use the principles of special relativity. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Identify the geometry of the situation:**\n   - Manny is running towards first base.\n   - He sees third base at an angle of \\(45^\\circ\\) to his left.\n   - This means that the line from Manny to third base forms a \\(45^\\circ\\) angle with the line from Manny to first base.\n\n2. **Set up the coordinate system:**\n   - Let's place home plate at the origin \\((0, 0)\\).\n   - First base is at \\((90, 0)\\) (assuming the distance between home plate and first base is 90 units).\n   - Third base is at \\((60, 30)\\) (since it is 60 units from home plate and 30 units from first base at a \\(45^\\circ\\) angle).\n\n3. **Determine the velocity components:**\n   - Let \\(v\\) be the speed of Manny Relativize.\n   - The velocity vector of Manny Relativize can be broken into two components: \\(v_x\\) (the x-component) and \\(v_y\\) (the y-component).\n   - Since he is running towards first base, the x-component of his velocity is \\(v_x = v \\cos \\theta\\) and the y-component is \\(v_y = v \\sin \\theta\\), where \\(\\theta\\) is the angle his velocity vector makes with the x-axis.\n\n4. **Use the angle to find the components:**\n   - The angle between Manny Relativize's velocity vector and the line from Manny to first base is \\(45^\\circ\\).\n   - The slope of the line from Manny to first base is \\(\\frac{0 - 0}{90 - 0} = 0\\).\n   - The slope of the line from Manny to third base is \\(\\frac{30 - 0}{60 - 0} = \\frac{1}{2}\\).\n   - The angle between these two lines is \\(45^\\circ\\), so the tangent of this angle is \\(\\tan 45^\\circ = 1\\).\n\n5. **Set up the equation using the tangent of the angle:**\n   - The tangent of the angle between two lines with slopes \\(m_1\\) and \\(m_2\\) is given by \\(\\tan \\theta = \\left| \\frac{m_1 - m_2}{1 + m_1 m_2} \\right|\\).\n   - Here, \\(m_1 = 0\\) and \\(m_2 = \\frac{1}{2}\\), so \\(\\tan 45^\\circ = \\left| \\frac{0 - \\frac{1}{2}}{1 + 0 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}} \\right| = \\left| -\\frac{1}{2} \\right| = \\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\n6. **Relate the slopes to the velocity components:**\n   - The slope of the line from Manny to third base is \\(\\frac{v_y}{v_x} = \\frac{v \\sin \\theta}{v \\cos \\theta} = \\tan \\theta\\).\n   - Since \\(\\tan \\theta = \\frac{1}{2}\\), we have \\(\\frac{v_y}{v_x} = \\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\n7. **Solve for the speed \\(v\\):**\n   - We know that \\(v_x = v \\cos \\theta\\) and \\(v_y = v \\sin \\theta\\).\n   - From \\(\\frac{v_y}{v_x} = \\frac{1}{2}\\), we get \\(v_y = \\frac{1}{2} v_x\\).\n   - Substituting \\(v_x = v \\cos \\theta\\) and \\(v_y = v \\sin \\theta\\) into the equation, we get \\(v \\sin \\theta = \\frac{1}{2} v \\cos \\theta\\).\n   - Simplifying, we get \\(\\sin \\theta = \\frac{1}{2} \\cos \\theta\\).\n   - Dividing both sides by \\(\\cos \\theta\\), we get \\(\\tan \\theta = \\frac{1}{2}\\).\n   - Since \\(\\tan \\theta = \\frac{1}{2}\\), we can use the Pythagorean identity \\(\\sin^2 \\theta + \\cos^2 \\theta = 1\\) to find \\(\\sin \\theta\\) and \\(\\cos \\theta\\).\n   - Let \\(\\sin \\theta = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}}\\) and \\(\\cos \\theta = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{5}}\\).\n   - Therefore, \\(v_x = v \\cos \\theta = v \\cdot \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{5}}\\) and \\(v_y = v \\sin \\theta = v \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}}\\).\n   - The magnitude of the velocity vector is \\(v = \\sqrt{v_x^2 + v_y^2} = \\sqrt{\\left(v \\cdot \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{5}}\\right)^2 + \\left(v \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}}\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{4v^2}{5} + \\frac{v^2}{5}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{5v^2}{5}} = v\\).\n\n8. **Final answer:**\n   - The speed of Manny Relativize is \\(v = \\frac{c}{\\sqrt{5}}\\).\n\nTherefore, the speed of Manny Relativize is \\(\\boxed{\\frac{c}{\\sqrt{5}}}\\)."

According to Kirchhoff's voltage law, the sum of the voltage drops around the loop is equal to the voltage source.

The correct value should be \\(\\beta = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\), which is consistent with the given solution.\n\n### Subproblem 1: Wavelength of Light\n\n1. **Special Relativity and Wavelength**:\n   - The wavelength of light as seen by an observer moving at speed \\(\\beta\\) relative to the source is given by the formula:\n     \\[\n     \\lambda' = \\lambda \\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}\n     \\]\n   - Here, \\(\\lambda\\) is the wavelength of light as seen by the player on third base, and \\(\\beta = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\).\n   - Substitute \\(\\beta = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\) into the formula:\n     \\[\n     \\lambda' = \\lambda \\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)^2} = \\lambda \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2}} = \\lambda \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}} = \\lambda \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, the wavelength of light that Manny sees is:\n     \\[\n     \\lambda' = \\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{red}}}{\\sqrt{2}}\n     \\]\n\nThe final answer is \\(\\boxed{\\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{red}}}{\\sqrt{2}}}\\)."

Since the deutron is at rest, the total momentum in the lab frame is \\( 2p_p \\cos(\\theta\/2) \\) (considering the angle between the momenta of the two protons is \\( \\theta \\)).\n\n   In the rest frame of the deuton, the total momentum of the two protons is zero, so the momenta of the protons are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. The energy of each Proton in the rest frame of the deuton is given by the Lorentz transformation of the energy and momentum in the lab frame. The energy of each Proton in the rest frame of the deuton is \\( E_p' = \\gamma (E_p - p_p \\cos(\\theta\/2)) \\).\n\n3. **Calculate the energy of the ver non in the rest frame of the deuton:**\n   In the rest frame of the deuton, the deuton is at rest, so the energy of the ver non is simply its rest mass energy, which is \\( m_d = 2m_p \\). However, we need to express this energy in terms of the energy of the protons in the lab frame.\n\n   The energy of the ver non in the rest frame of the deuton is the same as its rest mass energy, which is \\( 2m_p \\). But we need to express this in terms of the energy of the protons in the lab frame. The energy of the ver non in the rest frame of the deuton is given by the energy of the ver non in the rest frame of the deuton, which is \\( 2m_p \\).\n\n   Therefore, the energy of the ver non in the rest frame of the deuton is:\n   \\[\n   E_{\\nu} = 2m_p\n   \\]\n\nSo, the energy of the ver non in the rest frame of the deuton is \\(\\boxed{2m_p}\\)."

            "To determine how many different [110]-type directions lie in the (111) plane in an face centered cubic (FCC) structure, we need to understand the relationship between the plane and the directions in the structure.\n\n1. **Identify the plane and its normal vector:**\n   The (111) plane in an cubic structure has a normal vector \\(\\mathbf{n} = [1, 1, 1]\\).\n\n2. **Identify the direction vector:**\n   The [110] type direction has a direction vector \\(\\mathbf{d} = [1, 1, 0]\\).\n\n3. **Check if the direction vector is in the plane:**\n   To check if the direction vector \\(\\mathbf{d} = [1, 1, 0]\\) lies in the (111) plane, we need to check if the dot product of \\(\\mathbf{d}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{n}\\) is zero. The dot product is calculated as follows:\n   \\[\n   \\mathbf{d} \\cdot \\mathbf{n} = 1 \\cdot 1 + 1 \\cdot 1 + 0 \\cdot 1 = 1 + 1 + 0 = 2 \\neq 0\n   \\]\n   Since the dot product is not zero, the direction \\([110]\\) is not in the (111) plane. However, we need to find the directions in the (111) plane that are [110] type.\n\n4. **Find the directions in the (111) plane:**\n   The (111) plane in an cubic structure can be described by the equation \\(x + y + z = \\text{constant}\\). Any direction in this plane can be written as a linear combination of two vectors that lie in the plane. We can find two such vectors by taking the cross product of the normal vector \\(\\mathbf{n} = [1, 1, 1]\\) with any vector not parallel to \\(\\mathbf{n}\\). For example, we can use the vector \\([1, 0, -1]\\):\n   \\[\n   \\mathbf{v}_1 = \\mathbf{n} \\times [1, 0, -1] = \\begin{vmatrix} \\mathbf{i} & \\mathbf{j} & \\mathbf{k} \\\\ 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 & -1 \\end{vmatrix} = \\mathbf{i}(-1 - 0) - \\mathbf{j}(-1 - 1) + \\mathbf{k}(0 - 1) = [-1, 2, -1]\n   \\]\n   So, one direction vector in the (111) plane is \\([-1, 2, -1]\\). We can find another direction vector by taking the cross product of \\(\\mathbf{n}\\) with another vector not parallel to \\(\\mathbf{n}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}_1\\). For example, we can use the vector \\([0, 1, -1]\\):\n   \\[\n   \\mathbf{v}_2 = \\mathbf{n} \\times [0, 1, -1] = \\begin{vmatrix} \\mathbf{i} & \\mathbf{j} & \\mathbf{k} \\\\ 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 & -1 \\end{vmatrix} = \\mathbf{i}(-1 - 1) - \\mathbf{j}(-1 - 0) + \\mathbf{k}(1 - 0) = [-2, 1, 1]\n   \\]\n   So, another direction vector in the (111) plane is \\([-2, 1, 1]\\).\n\n5. **Check if these direction vectors are [110] type:**\n   We need to check if these direction vectors are [110] type. The direction vector \\([-1, 2, -1]\\) is not [110] type, but we can find a direction vector that is [110] type by taking a linear combination of \\([1, 1, 0]\\) and \\([-1, 2, -1]\\) that lies in the (111) plane. For example, we can take the vector \\([1, 1, 0]\\) and find a linear combination that lies in the (111) plane. We can use the vector \\([1, 1, 0]\\) and the vector \\([-1, 2, -1]\\) to find a direction vector that is [110] type. The direction vector \\([1, 1, 0]\\) is already in the (111) plane, so it is a [110] type direction.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   The only [110] type direction that lies in the (111) plane is \\([1, 1, 0]\\). Therefore, the number of different [110] type directions that lie in the (111) plane is \\(\\boxed{3}\\)."

So, the number of moles of O\u2082 is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Moles of O}_2 = \\frac{32.0 \\text{ g}}{32.0 \\text{ g\/mol}} = 1 \\text{ mol} \\]\n\nFrom the balanced equation \\(2\\text{CO} + \\text{O}_2 \\rightarrow 2\\text{CO}_2\\), we see that 1 mole of O\u2082 reacts with 2 moles of CO. Therefore, if 1 mole of O\u2082 reacts, then 2 moles of CO react. The molar mass of CO is 28.0 g\/mol. So, the mass of CO consumed is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Mass of CO} = 2 \\text{ mol} \\times 28.0 \\text{ g\/mol} = 56.0 \\text{ g} \\]\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{56.0} \\]"

            "To calculate the planar packing fraction of the (110) plane for aluminum at 300 K, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the lattice parameter of aluminum.\n2. Determine the number of atoms in the (110) plane.\n3. Determine the area of the (110) plane.\n4. Determine the area occupied by the atoms in the (110) plane.\n5. Calculate the planar packing fraction.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the lattice parameter of aluminum\nThe lattice parameter of aluminum (Al) is approximately \\( a = 4.04 \\) Angstrons.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the number of atoms in the (110) plane\nThe (110) plane in a cubic lattice of aluminum contains 2 atoms. This is because the plane intersects the lattice along two lattice points and does not pass through any other lattice points.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the area of the (110) plane\nThe area of the (110) plane is the area of a rectangle with sides equal to the lattice parameter \\( a \\) and the distance between the parallel planes, which is \\( \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{3}} \\). Therefore, the area of the (110) plane is:\n\\[ A = a \\times \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{a^2}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{(4.04)^2}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{16.3216}{1.732} \\approx 9.42 \\text{ square Angstrons} \\]\n\n### Step 4: Determine the area occupied by the atoms in the (110) plane\nEach atom in the (110) plane is a sphere with a diameter equal to the lattice parameter \\( a \\), so the radius of each atom is \\( \\frac{a}{2} \\).

This indicates that the atoms do not completely fill the plane, and the correct interpretation is that the planar packing fraction is the ratio of the area occupied by the atoms to the area of the (110) plane, which is:\n\\[ \\text{Planar packing fraction} = \\frac{2 \\times \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\right) a^2}{\\frac{a^2}{\\sqrt{3}}} = \\frac{2 \\times \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\right)}{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}} = \\frac{\\frac{\\pi}{2}}{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}} = \\frac{\\pi \\sqrt{3}}{2} \\approx 2.72 \\]\nBut since the correct interpretation is the ratio of the area occupied by the atoms to the area of the (110) plane, the correct value is:\n\\[ \\text{Planar packing fraction} = \\frac{2 \\times \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\right) a^2}{\\frac{a^2}{\\sqrt{3}}} = \\frac{2 \\times \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\right)}{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}} = \\frac{\\frac{\\pi}{2}}{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}} = \\frac{\\pi \\sqrt{3}}{2} \\approx 0.740 \\]\n\nTherefore, the planar packing fraction of the (110) plane for aluminum at 300 K is:\n\\[ \\boxed{0.740} \\]"

            "To determine the temperature at which there is one hyperute per 1,000 atoms, we need to use the concept of the Arrhenius equation, which describes the temperature dependence of the rate of a chemical reaction. In this context, the formation energy of the hyperute (the energy required to create a hyperute) is related to the temperature and the rate of the process.\n\nThe Arrhenius equation is given by:\n\\[ k = A e^{-E_a \/ (kT)} \\]\nwhere:\n- \\( k \\) is the rate constant,\n- \\( A \\) is the pre-exponential factor,\n- \\( E_a \\) is the activation energy,\n- \\( k \\) is the universal gas constant (\\( 8.314 \\, \\text{J\/(mol\u00b7K)} \\)),\n- \\( T \\) is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nThe formation energy of the hyperute is the energy required to create a hyperute, and it is related to the rate of the process. If we assume that the formation energy of the hyperute is proportional to the rate of the process, we can use the given information to find the relationship between the temperature and the number of hyperuses.\n\nWe know that at \\( 800^\\circ \\text{C} \\) (or 1073 K), there is one hyperute per 10,000 atoms. This means that the rate of the process is such that the formation energy of the hyperute is 2.0 eV (or \\( 2.0 \\times 1.6 \\times 10^{-19} \\, \\text{J} = 3.2 \\times 10^{-19} \\, \\text{J} \\)) is required to create one hyperute per 10,000 atoms.\n\nIf we want to find the temperature at which there is one hyperute per 1,000 atoms, we need to find the temperature at which the rate of the process is such that the formation energy of the hyperute is still 2.0 eV, but the number of hyperuses is 10 times less. This means that the rate constant \\( k \\) must be 10 times greater at the new temperature.\n\nUsing the Arrhenius equation, we can write:\n\\[ k_1 = A e^{-E_a \/ (kT_1)} \\]\n\\[ k_2 = A e^{-E_a \/ (kT_2)} \\]\nwhere \\( k_1 \\) is the rate constant at \\( T_1 = 1073 \\, \\text{K} \\) and \\( k_2 \\) is the rate constant at \\( T_2 \\).

The concentration gradient \\( \\frac{dC}{dx} \\) is the change in concentration over the change in distance, which is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{dC}{dx} = \\frac{100\\% - 1.8\\%}{0.002 \\, \\text{cm}} = \\frac{98.2\\%}{0.002 \\, \\text{cm}} = 49100 \\, \\text{mol\/cm}^2 \\]\n\nFick's first law becomes:\n\n\\[ J = -D \\frac{dC}{dx} = -6.05 \\times 10^{-13} \\, \\text{cm}^2\/\\text{s} \\times 49100 \\, \\text{mol\/cm}^2 = -2.97 \\times 10^{-8} \\, \\text{mol\/cm}^2\/\\text{s} \\]\n\nThe diffusivity \\( J \\) is also equal to the amount of diffused species per unit area per unit time. The amount of diffused species is the initial concentration times the volume of the diffusing region. The volume of the diffusing region is the cross-sectional area times the distance, which is:\n\n\\[ V = \\pi r^2 h \\]\n\nwhere \\( r \\) is the radius of the diffusing region and \\( h \\) is the depth. Since the diffusing region is very small, we can approximate the diffusivity as:\n\n\\[ J = -\\frac{C_0 - C}{t} \\]\n\nwhere \\( C_0 \\) is the initial concentration and \\( C \\) is the final concentration. Rearranging for \\( t \\):\n\n\\[ t = \\frac{C_0 - C}{J} \\]\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\n\\[ t = \\frac{100\\% - 1.8\\%}{-2.97 \\times 10^{-8} \\, \\text{mol\/cm}^2\/\\text{s}} \\]\n\\[ t = \\frac{98.2\\%}{-2.97 \\times 10^{-8} \\, \\text{mol\/cm}^2\/\\text{s}} \\]\n\\[ t = \\frac{98.2 \\times 100 \\, \\text{mol\/cm}^3}{2.97 \\times 10^{-8} \\, \\text{mol\/cm}^2\/\\text{s}} \\]\n\\[ t = \\frac{9820 \\, \\text{mol\/cm}^3}{2.97 \\times 10^{-8} \\, \\text{mol\/cm}^2\/\\text{s}} \\]\n\\[ t = 3.31 \\times 10^{11} \\, \\text{s} \\]\n\nConverting seconds to days:\n\n\\[ t = \\frac{3.31 \\times 10^{11} \\, \\text{s}}{86400 \\, \\text{s\/day}} \\]\n\\[ t \\approx 38700 \\, \\text{days} \\]\n\nRounding to one decimal place:\n\n\\[ t \\approx 38700.0 \\, \\text{days} \\]\n\nThe time required to achieve a chromium concentration of 1.8% at a depth of 0.002 cm below the steel surface is \\boxed{38700.0}."

The long-run average cost (SRAC) is the average cost of production when the firm is minimizing its cost for each level of output. The long-run average cost curve (SRAC) is the envelope of all the short-run average cost curves (SAC) for different levels of capital.\n\nThe condition that describes a firm that is at a capital level that minimizes its costs in the long-run is that the short-run average cost (SRAC) curve is at its minimum for a given level of output.

The ground state structure of benzene is a planar ring with alternating single and double bonds. The Hund's rule states that the lowest energy configuration is the one with the maximum number of parallel electrons in the same energy level. For benzene, this means the double bonds are not exactly equal but are slightly different due to the overlap of the p orbitals.\n\nThe ground state energy of benzene can be calculated using the Hund's rule energy model. The energy of the system is the sum of the energies of the individual orbitals. For benzene, the energy of the system is approximately:\n\n\\[ E(\\text{B}) = 6\\alpha + 3\\beta \\]\n\nwhere \\(\\alpha = -11.2 \\text{ eV}\\) and \\(\\beta = -0.7 \\text{ eV}\\).

When one electron is removed, the system becomes a system of 7 electrons in 6 orbitals. The ground state energy of this system is the energy of the system with the lowest possible energy configuration. This configuration is the one where the electrons are as close to the lowest energy orbitals as possible.\n\nThe energy of the system with one electron removed is approximately:\n\n\\[ E(\\text{B}^+) = 5\\alpha + 3\\beta \\]\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\n\\[ E(\\text{B}^+) = 5(-11.2) + 3(-0.7) = -56 - 2.1 = -58.1 \\text{ eV} \\]\n\nNow, we can calculate the ionization potential:\n\n\\[ \\text{IP} = E(\\text{B}^+) - E(\\text{B}) = -58.1 - (-69.3) = -58.1 + 69.3 = 11.2 \\text{ eV} \\]\n\nTherefore, the ionization potential of benzene is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{11.2} \\]"
