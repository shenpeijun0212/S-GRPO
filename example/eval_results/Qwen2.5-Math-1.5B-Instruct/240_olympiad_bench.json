            "To determine the number \\( N \\) that Xenia thought of, we need to understand the constraints and the information provided by each move.

This means that \\( N \\) is a common solution to the system of congruences:\n\n\\[ N \\equiv a_1 \\pmod{1} \\]\n\\[ N \\equiv a_2 \\pmod{2} \\]\n\\[ \\vdots \\]\n\\[ N \\equiv a_{20} \\pmod{20} \\]\n\nSince \\( N \\) is a positive integer not exceeding 5000, and it satisfies all these congruences, we can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) to find a unique solution modulo the least common multiple (LCM) of the numbers 1 through 20. The LCM of the numbers 1 through 20 is 232792560, but since \\( N \\) is constrained to be less than or equal to 5000, we only need to consider the solution within this range.\n\nTo determine \\( N \\) uniquely, Sergey needs to ask questions that will allow him to narrow down the possibilities for \\( N \\) to a single value.

By asking about the set \\( S \\) of indices, Sergey can determine which \\( a_k \\) corresponds to which index by process of elimination and the properties of congruences.\n\nThe number of moves required is equal to the number of distinct prime factors of the LCM of the numbers 1 through 20, because each move can effectively eliminate one possible value of \\( N \\) within the range of 1 to 5000. The LCM of the numbers 1 through 20 is \\( 2^4 \\times 3^2 \\times 5 \\times 7 \\times 11 \\times 13 \\times 17 \\times 19 \\), which has 8 distinct prime factors. Therefore, Sergey needs 8 moves to determine \\( N \\) uniquely.\n\nThus, the number of moves Sergey needs to determine for sure the number Xenia thought of is \\(\\boxed{8}\\)."

The weight of a number is the number of 1's in its binary representation.\n\nFirst, consider the binary representation of numbers from 0 to \\(2^{2017} - 1\\). These numbers are all the possible combinations of 2017 bits (each bit can be either 0 or 1).

Half of these numbers have an even weight and the other half have an odd weight. This is because for any number with a given weight, there is a corresponding number with the opposite weight obtained by flipping the rightmost 1 to 0 or the leftmost 0 to 1. This operation changes the parity of the weight.\n\nTherefore, the number of integers from 0 to \\(2^{2017} - 1\\) with even weight is \\(2^{2016}\\), and the number of integers with odd weight is also \\(2^{2016}\\).\n\nNow, we need to consider the number \\(2^{2017}\\) itself.

A collection is tight if:\n1. The union of the subsets is a proper subset of \\(X\\).\n2. No element of \\(X\\) lies in exactly one of the subsets.\n\nThis means that every element of \\(X\\) must lie in at least two of the subsets, or in all of them.

If we have a collection of subsets where every element of \\(X\\) lies in at least two subsets, then no sub collection can be tight because the union of any sub collection will still include elements that lie in an even number of subsets, and thus cannot be a proper subset of \\(X\\) without including elements that lie in exactly one subset.\n\nThe maximum number of subsets we can have without forming a tight sub collection is when each element of \\(X\\) lies in exactly two subsets.

Each edge will be part of exactly two subsets, and the union of all subsets will be the entire graph, which is not a proper subset of \\(X\\).

This means that \\( f \\) must be zero for all configurations of points that satisfy these conditions and non-zero for all other configurations.\n\nFirst, let's consider the geometric properties of a regular \\( 2n \\)-gon. A regular \\( 2n \\)-gon has \\( 2n \\) vertices, and these vertices are symmetrically placed on a circle.

We need to find planes that cover all these points but do not pass through the origin.\n\nOne way to approach this is to consider the planes that are parallel to the coordinate planes and pass through the points where one of the coordinates is fixed at 1. Specifically, we can use the planes \\( x = 1 \\), \\( y = 1 \\), and \\( z = 1 \\). These planes will cover all points in \\( S \\) because any point \\((x, y, z)\\) in \\( S \\) must have at least one of its coordinates be at least 1, and thus it will lie on one of these planes.\n\nTo verify that these three planes are sufficient, consider any point \\((x, y, z)\\) in \\( S \\). Since \\( x + y + z > 0 \\), at least one of \\( x \\), \\( y \\), or \\( z \\) must be at least 1. If \\( x \\geq 1 \\), then the point lies on the plane \\( x = 1 \\).

Therefore, every point in \\( S \\) lies on at least one of these three planes.\n\nTo show that three planes are indeed the minimum number required, we need to consider that any fewer than three planes would not be able to cover all points in \\( S \\). For example, if we only use two planes, say \\( x = 1 \\) and \\( y = 1 \\), then the point \\((0, 0, 1)\\) (which is in \\( S \\)) would not be covered. Therefore, three planes are necessary.\n\nThus, the smallest number of planes that jointly contain all points of \\( S \\) but none of them passes through the origin is \\(\\boxed{3}\\)."

Substituting these into the original equation, we get:\n\n\\[\nf^{g(n)+1}(n) + g^{f(n)}(n) = f^{1+1}(n) + g^n(n) = f^2(n) + g(n) = n + 1.\n\\]\n\nAnd the right-hand side becomes:\n\n\\[\nf(n+1) - g(n+1) + 1 = (n+1) - 1 + 1 = n + 1.\n\\]\n\nHere, both sides are equal, so \\((f, g) = (n, 1)\\) is a solution. We need to check if there are any other solutions. Assume \\(f(n) = 1\\) and \\(g(n) = n\\). Substituting these into the original equation, we get:\n\n\\[\nf^{g(n)+1}(n) + g^{f(n)}(n) = f^{n+1}(n) + g^1(n) = 1 + n = n + 1.\n\\]\n\nAnd the right-hand side becomes:\n\n\\[\nf(n+1) - g(n+1) + 1 = 1 - (n+1) + 1 = -n + 1.\n\\]\n\nClearly, \\(n + 1 \\neq -n + 1\\) for any positive integer \\(n\\), so \\((f, g) = (1, n)\\) is not a solution.\n\nFinally, let's try \\(f(n) = n\\) and \\(g(n) = n\\). We have already shown that this is not a solution. Therefore, the only solution is \\((f, g) = (n, 1)\\).\n\nThus, the only pair \\((f, g)\\) that satisfies the given equation is \\(\\boxed{(n, 1)}\\)."

This means that each subset \\( A_i \\) must be able to generate all sums from 15 upwards by summing distinct pairs of its elements.\n\nWe start by examining the smallest possible values for \\( n \\). For \\( n = 15 \\), we need to find two distinct elements in each subset that sum to 15. The pairs that sum to 15 are \\((1, 14), (2, 13), (3, 12), (4, 11), (5, 10), (6, 9), (7, 8)\\). This means that each subset \\( A_i \\) must contain at least one element from each of these pairs to ensure that we can always find two distinct elements that sum to 15.\n\nNow, let's consider the general case for \\( n \\geq 15 \\). If we have \\( k \\) subsets, each subset must be able to generate all sums from 15 upwards. This means that each subset must be able to generate a sequence of sums that covers all integers starting from 15. The key is to determine the minimum number of subsets required to ensure this property.\n\nTo do this, we can use the concept of the \"sum partition\" problem. We need to partition the positive integers into subsets such that each subset can generate all sums from 15 upwards. One way to approach this is to consider the residues modulo 7. If we partition the positive integers into 7 subsets based on their residues modulo 7, we can ensure that each subset can generate all sums from 15 upwards. Specifically, if we partition the integers into subsets \\( A_0, A_1, \\ldots, A_6 \\) where \\( A_i \\) contains all integers of the form \\( 7m + i \\) for \\( m \\geq 0 \\), then each subset \\( A_i \\) can generate all sums from 15 upwards by summing distinct pairs of its elements.\n\nTo see why this works, consider the subset \\( A_0 \\). The smallest element in \\( A_0 \\) is 7, and the next smallest is 14. The sum of 7 and 14 is 21, which is greater than 15. By adding more elements from \\( A_0 \\), we can generate all sums from 15 upwards. The same argument applies to the other subsets \\( A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_6 \\).\n\nTherefore, the greatest positive integer \\( k \\) that satisfies the given property is \\( k = 6 \\).\n\nThe answer is \\(\\boxed{6}\\)."

            "To determine the latest possible moment at which the last ant falls off the checkerboard, we need to analyze the movement of the ants and the conditions under which they fall off. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Understanding the Movement:**\n   - Each ant moves with speed 1 parallel to one of the edges of the checkerboard.\n   - When two ants moving in opposite directions meet, they both turn \\(90^\\circ\\) clockwise and continue moving with speed 1.\n   - When more than two ants meet, or when two ants moving in perpendicular directions meet, the ants continue moving in the same direction as before they met.\n   - When an ant reaches one of the edges of the checkerboard, it falls off and will not re-appear.\n\n2. **Key Insight:**\n   - The key insight is that the ants can be thought of as moving in a way that is equivalent to moving in a straight line in a transformed coordinate system. Specifically, if we consider the checkerboard as a grid of unit squares and each ant as a point moving in a straight line in a transformed grid, the ants will essentially form a \"\ufffd corners\" pattern as they move.\n\n3. **Transforming the Problem:**\n   - We can transform the checkerboard into a grid where each ant moves in a straight line. This transformation simplifies the problem because the ants will essentially form a \"\ufffd corners\" pattern as they move.\n   - The latest ant to fall off the checkerboard will be the one that starts at the farthest point from the edge of the checkerboard and moves in the direction that is farthest from the edge.\n\n4. **Calculating the latest moment:**\n   - The farthest point from the edge of the checkerboard is the center of the checkerboard. For an \\(m \\times m\\) checkerboard, the center is at \\(\\left(\\frac{m}{2}, \\frac{m}{2}\\right)\\) if \\(m\\) is even, or at \\(\\left(\\frac{m-1}{2}, \\frac{m-1}{2}\\right)\\) if \\(m\\) is odd.\n   - The distance from the center to the nearest edge is \\(\\frac{m-1}{2}\\) (if \\(m\\) is odd) or \\(\\frac{m}{2} - 1\\) (if \\(m\\) is even).\n   - Since each ant moves with speed 1, the latest ant to fall off the checkerboard will be at time \\(\\frac{m-1}{2}\\) (if \\(m\\) is odd) or \\(\\frac{m}{2} - 1\\) (if \\(m\\) is even).\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The latest possible moment at which the last ant falls off the checkerboard is \\(\\left\\lfloor \\frac{m}{2} \\right\\rfloor\\).\n\nTherefore, the latest possible moment at which the last ant falls off the checkerboard is \\(\\boxed{m-1}\\)."

This implies that for any three consecutive terms, their sum is at most 1. We want to maximize \\( S = \\sum_{i=1}^{100} x_i x_{i+2} \\).\n\nTo gain insight, let's try to find a configuration of \\( x_i \\) that might maximize \\( S \\). Suppose we set \\( x_1 = x_3 = x_5 = \\cdots = x_{99} = a \\) and \\( x_2 = x_4 = x_6 = \\cdots = x_{100} = b \\).

            "To determine the smallest positive integer \\( M \\) such that among any \\( M \\) distinct flags, there exist \\( N \\) flags forming a diverse set, we need to analyze the properties of the flags and the conditions for a diverse set.\n\nFirst, let's understand the problem in terms of combinatorics. Each flag is an \\( N \\)-unit wide and 1-unit high flag composed of \\( N \\) fields, each field being either yellow or blue. Therefore, there are \\( 2^N \\) possible flags, since each of the \\( N \\) fields can be either yellow or blue.\n\nA set of \\( N \\) flags is diverse if these flags can be arranged into an \\( N \\times N \\) square so that all \\( N \\) fields on its main diagonal will have the same color.

The pigeonhole principle states that if \\( M \\) items are put into \\( N \\) containers, with \\( M > N \\), then at least one container must contain more than one item.\n\nIn this context, the \"containers\" are the possible colorings of the main diagonal of the \\( N \\times N \\) square.

Therefore, if we have more than \\( 2 \\cdot (2^N - 1) \\) flags, we are guaranteed that there will be at least \\( N \\) flags that can be arranged to form a diverse set.\n\nTo see why, consider the worst-case scenario where we have \\( 2 \\cdot (2^N - 1) \\) flags. In this case, we could have \\( 2^N - 1 \\) flags that are all yellow on the main diagonal and \\( 2^N - 1 \\) flags that are all blue on the main diagonal. However, since there are only \\( 2^N \\) possible flags, and we have \\( 2 \\cdot (2^N - 1) \\) flags, by the pigeonhole principle, we must have at least \\( N \\) flags that are all yellow or all blue on the main diagonal, which means we can form a diverse set.\n\nTherefore, the smallest \\( M \\) such that among any \\( M \\) distinct flags, there exist \\( N \\) flags forming a diverse set is \\( M = 2^N \\).\n\nThe answer is \\(\\boxed{2^N}\\)."

This is a classic problem in combinatorial design, specifically related to the construction of a 100 by 100 binary matrix with exactly 25 ones in each row and each column, and no two ones in adjacent positions (including diagonally).\n\nFirst, let's understand the constraints. Each king must be placed such that no two kings are adjacent, which means that each king must be surrounded by empty squares. This implies that the kings must be placed in a checkerboard pattern, but with a specific arrangement that ensures each row and each column has exactly 25 kings.\n\nOne way to approach this is to use the concept of a \"balanced incomplete block design\" or more specifically, a \"concurrent 100-1-25 design\". However, a simpler and more direct approach is to use the fact that the problem is equivalent to finding the number of ways to place 25 non-attacking kings on a $100 \\times 100$ board such that each row and each column has exactly 25 kings.\n\nThe solution to this problem is known to be the number of ways to permute 100 elements taken 25 at a time, which is given by the formula for the number of 100 by 100 0-1 matrices with exactly 25 ones in each row and each column, and no two ones in adjacent positions. This number is known to be:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{100!}{(25!)^4}\n\\]\n\nThis is because we are essentially choosing 25 positions in each row such that no two are adjacent, and this must be done in a way that each column also has exactly 25 ones. The exact combinatorial argument for this is quite complex and involves advanced combinatorial techniques, but the result is known to be:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{0}\n\\]\n\nThis is because it is impossible to place 2500 kings on a $100 \\times 100$ chessboard such that no two kings are adjacent and each row and each column has exactly 25 kings. The constraints are too restrictive for such an arrangement to exist."

The polynomial on the left-hand side, \\( x^2 + 7 \\), is a quadratic polynomial. Each \\( f_i(x) \\) is a polynomial with rational coefficients, and the degree of \\( f_i(x)^2 \\) is twice the degree of \\( f_i(x) \\).

One possible solution is \\( b = 2 \\) and \\( d = \\sqrt{3} \\), but again, we need rational coefficients. Instead, we can use the identity for the sum of squares of rational numbers. For example, we can use the identity \\( (x^2 + 1)^2 + (2x)^2 = x^4 + 4x^2 + 1 + 4x^2 = x^4 + 8x^2 + 1 \\), but this is not directly helpful here.

            "To solve the problem, we need to understand the structure of the dissection and the properties of the diagonals and triangles involved. Let's start by analyzing the properties of the diagonals and the triangles formed in the dissection of a regular 2006-gon.\n\n1. **Understanding the Diagonals:**\n   - A diagonal of a regular 2006-gon is called odd if its endpoints divide the boundary into two parts, each composed of an odd number of sides. This means that if we label the vertices of the 2006-gon as \\(A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_{2006}\\), a diagonal \\(A_iA_j\\) is odd if both \\(i-j\\) and \\(2006 - (i-j)\\) are odd. This is equivalent to saying that \\(i-j\\) is odd.\n   - Sides of the 2006-gon are also considered as odd diagonals.\n\n2. **Properties of Isosceles Triangles:**\n   - An isosceles triangle with two odd sides must have its base as an odd diagonal. This is because the two equal sides are sides of the 2006-gon, which are odd diagonals, and the third side is an odd diagonal.\n\n3. **Counting the Isosceles Triangles:**\n   - In a dissection of a regular 2006-gon into triangles, each triangle has either two sides that are sides of the 2006-gon (and thus odd) or two sides that are diagonals. We are interested in the triangles that have two odd sides.\n   - Each vertex of the 2006-gon is shared by two triangles. If we consider the structure of the dissection, each vertex will be part of an even number of triangles (since the dissection is into triangles and the sum of the angles around each vertex is \\(360^\\circ\\)).\n   - To maximize the number of isosceles triangles with two odd sides, we need to maximize the number of triangles that have their base as an odd diagonal. This can be achieved by ensuring that as many diagonals as possible are odd.\n\n4. **Maximizing the Number of Odd Diagonals:**\n   - In a regular 2006-gon, half of the diagonals are odd. This is because for each diagonal, either its endpoints divide the boundary into two parts with an odd number of sides or an even number of sides. Since there are 2006 vertices, there are \\( \\binom{2006}{2} = 2006 \\times 1002 = 2012012 \\) diagonals in total, and half of them are odd.\n   - Therefore, the maximum number of isosceles triangles with two odd sides is half of the total number of triangles in the dissection. Since the dissection of a 2006-gon into triangles uses 2003 diagonals, the number of triangles is 2004 (since each diagonal adds one triangle to the dissection).\n\nThus, the maximum possible number of isosceles triangles with two odd sides is \\(\\boxed{1003}\\)."

The term \\(2^{2x+1}\\) grows much faster than \\(2^x\\) and 1, so the left-hand side will be a large number that is not likely to be a perfect square. We can use modular arithmetic to confirm this. For example, modulo 8, \\(2^{2x+1} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{8}\\) for \\(x \\geq 1\\), and the left-hand side will be \\(1 + a + 2a^2 \\pmod{8}\\), which does not form a perfect square for any integer \\(a\\).\n\nThus, the only integer solutions are \\((0, 2)\\) and \\((0, -2)\\). Therefore, the pairs \\((x, y)\\) are\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{(0, 2), (0, -2)}.\n\\]"

            "To determine the largest \\( N \\) for which there exists a table \\( T \\) of integers with \\( N \\) rows and 100 columns that satisfies the given properties, we need to analyze the constraints carefully.\n\nFirst, let's understand the properties of the table:\n1. Every row contains the numbers 1, 2, ..., 100 in some order.\n2. For any two distinct rows \\( r \\) and \\( s \\), there is a column \\( c \\) such that \\( |T(r, c) - T(s, c)| \\geq 2 \\).\n\nThis second property implies that if we consider any two rows, there must be at least one column where the difference between the numbers in that column is at least 2. This means that the numbers in the same column of any two rows must be sufficiently far apart.\n\nTo maximize \\( N \\), we need to consider how we can arrange the numbers in the columns to satisfy the second property. One way to approach this is to use a combinatorial argument based on the pigeonhole principle.\n\nConsider the possible values that can appear in each column. If we have more than 50 rows, then by the pigeonhole principle, at least two rows must have the same number in the same column. However, this would violate the second property because the difference between the same number is 0, which is less than 2. Therefore, the maximum number of rows \\( N \\) must be such that no two rows have the same number in any column.\n\nSince there are 100 possible numbers (1 through 100) and each column can have at most 50 different numbers (to ensure that any two rows have different numbers in at least one column), the maximum number of rows \\( N \\) is 50. This is because if we have 51 or more rows, then by the pigeonhole principle, at least one number must appear in the same column in at least two rows, which would violate the second property.\n\nTo confirm, let's construct such a table. We can arrange the numbers in the columns such that each column alternates between two sets of 50 numbers. For example, the first column could be 1, 3, 5, ..., 99, the second column could be 2, 4, 6, ..., 100, the third column could be 1, 3, 5, ..., 99, and so on. This arrangement ensures that any two rows will have different numbers in at least one column, and the difference between any two different numbers in the same column is at least 2.\n\nTherefore, the largest \\( N \\) for which such a table exists is \\(\\boxed{50}\\)."

If \\( k = 1 \\), then \\( n \\) must be a perfect square, because the only divisor of \\( n \\) is \\( n \\) itself, and \\( n \\) must be a perfect square. So, \\( n = m^2 \\) for some integer \\( m \\).\n\nNext, let's consider \\( k = 2 \\). The divisors of \\( n \\) are \\( 1 \\) and \\( n \\). We need \\( 1 + n \\) to be a perfect square. Let \\( n = m^2 \\). Then \\( 1 + m^2 \\) must be a perfect square. Let \\( 1 + m^2 = a^2 \\) for some integer \\( a \\). This can be rewritten as \\( a^2 - m^2 = 1 \\), or \\((a-m)(a+m) = 1\\). The only integer solutions to this equation are \\( a = 1 \\) and \\( m = 0 \\), or \\( a = -1 \\) and \\( m = 0 \\), but since \\( m \\) must be a positive integer, there are no solutions for \\( k = 2 \\).\n\nNow, let's consider \\( k = 3 \\). The divisors of \\( n \\) are \\( 1, d, n \\) where \\( d \\) is the middle divisor. We need \\( 1 + d \\) and \\( 1 + d + n \\) to be perfect squares. Let \\( 1 + d = a^2 \\) and \\( 1 + d + n = b^2 \\) for some integers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\). Then \\( n = b^2 - a^2 = (b-a)(b+a) \\). Since \\( d \\) is a divisor of \\( n \\), \\( d \\) must be one of the factors of \\( n \\). Let's test some small values of \\( n \\).\n\nIf \\( n = 4 \\), the divisors are \\( 1, 2, 4 \\).

We need \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\) and \\( 1 + 3 + 9 = 13 \\) to be perfect squares, but 13 is not. So, \\( n = 9 \\) does not work.\n\nIf \\( n = 16 \\), the divisors are \\( 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 \\). We need to check if there is a permutation of these divisors such that the sum of the first \\( i \\) terms is a perfect square. Let's try the permutation \\( 1, 8, 7, 0, 0 \\). Then \\( 1 = 1^2 \\), \\( 1 + 8 = 9 = 3^2 \\), \\( 1 + 8 + 7 = 16 = 4^2 \\), \\( 1 + 8 + 7 + 0 = 16 = 4^2 \\), \\( 1 + 8 + 7 + 0 + 0 = 16 = 4^2 \\). This works, so \\( n = 16 \\) is a solution.\n\nTo generalize, we need to check if there are any other values of \\( n \\) that work. If \\( n \\) has more than 3 divisors, the conditions become more restrictive, and it is difficult to find a permutation that satisfies the condition for all \\( i \\). Therefore, the only solution is \\( n = 1 \\) and \\( n = 4 \\).\n\nThe only positive integer \\( n \\) that satisfies the given property is \\( \\boxed{1} \\)."

            "To determine the maximum number of tangent segments that can be drawn between 2017 mutually external circles on a blackboard, we need to consider the properties of the circles and the constraints given in the problem. Specifically, we need to ensure that no two tangent segments intersect each other or any of the circles.\n\nFirst, let's understand the structure of the problem. Each pair of circles can have at most two common external tangents. However, since no three circles share a common tangent, each pair of circles can have at most one tangent segment drawn between them without intersecting any other circles or tangent segments. This means that the problem reduces to finding the maximum number of non-intersecting tangent segments that can be drawn between the circles.\n\nWe can model this problem using a graph where each circle is a vertex and each tangent segment is an edge. The condition that no two tangent segments intersect each other or any of the circles means that the graph must be planar. According to Euler's formula for planar graphs, for a planar graph with \\( V \\) vertices, \\( E \\) edges, and \\( F \\) faces (including the outer face), the following relationship holds:\n\\[ V - E + F = 2. \\]\nIn our case, \\( V = 2017 \\). The number of faces \\( F \\) is at least 2 (the outer face and the face inside the graph). To maximize the number of edges \\( E \\), we need to minimize the number of faces. The minimum number of faces is 2, which occurs when the graph is a tree (a connected graph with no cycles). For a tree, \\( F = 2 \\) and \\( E = V - 1 \\). Therefore, the maximum number of edges in a planar graph with 2017 vertices is:\n\\[ E = 2017 - 1 = 2016. \\]\nThis means that the maximum number of tangent segments that can be drawn is 2016.\n\nTo verify that this is achievable, we can construct a tree where each circle is connected to exactly one other circle, forming a chain or a star-like structure. In such a structure, no two tangent segments intersect each other or any of the circles, and the number of tangent segments is indeed 2016.\n\nTherefore, the only possible number of tangent segments when Luciano stops drawing is:\n\\[ \\boxed{2016}. \\]"

This is because if we divide the interval \\([1, \\infty)\\) into 9 equal subintervals, each subinterval has length 1.

            "To find all positive integers \\( n \\) for which all positive divisors of \\( n \\) can be put into the cells of a rectangular table such that the sums of all rows are equal and the sums of all columns are equal, we need to consider the properties of the divisors of \\( n \\) and the structure of the table.\n\nFirst, let's denote the number of divisors of \\( n \\) by \\( d(n) \\). The sum of all divisors of \\( n \\) is denoted by \\( \\sigma(n) \\). If we can arrange the divisors of \\( n \\) into a rectangular table where the sums of the rows and columns are equal, then the total sum of all divisors, \\( \\sigma(n) \\), must be divisible by both the number of rows and the number of columns. This means that \\( \\sigma(n) \\) must be divisible by the product of the number of rows and the number of columns.\n\nLet's consider the possible values for the number of rows and columns. If the table has \\( r \\) rows and \\( c \\) columns, then \\( d(n) = r \\times c \\) and \\( \\sigma(n) \\) must be divisible by \\( r \\times c \\). The simplest case to consider is when the table is a square, i.e., \\( r = c \\). In this case, \\( d(n) = r^2 \\) and \\( \\sigma(n) \\) must be divisible by \\( r^2 \\).\n\nNow, let's check the smallest values of \\( n \\):\n\n1. If \\( n = 1 \\), then \\( d(1) = 1 \\) and \\( \\sigma(1) = 1 \\). The table is just a single cell, which trivially satisfies the conditions.\n2. If \\( n = 2 \\), then \\( d(2) = 2 \\) and \\( \\sigma(2) = 3 \\). The table is a \\( 1 \\times 2 \\) or \\( 2 \\times 1 \\) table, which does not satisfy the condition that the sums of the rows and columns are equal.\n3. If \\( n = 3 \\), then \\( d(3) = 2 \\) and \\( \\sigma(3) = 4 \\). The table is a \\( 1 \\times 3 \\) or \\( 3 \\times 1 \\) table, which does not satisfy the condition that the sums of the rows and columns are equal.\n4. If \\( n = 4 \\), then \\( d(4) = 3 \\) and \\( \\sigma(4) = 7 \\). The table is a \\( 1 \\times 4 \\) or \\( 4 \\times 1 \\) table, which does not satisfy the condition that the sums of the rows and columns are equal.\n5. If \\( n = 6 \\), then \\( d(6) = 4 \\) and \\( \\sigma(6) = 12 \\). The table is a \\( 2 \\times 2 \\) table, and we can arrange the divisors 1, 2, 3, 6 in such a way that the sums of the rows and columns are equal (e.g., \\(\\begin{array}{cc} 1 & 6 \\\\ 2 & 3 \\end{array}\\)). This satisfies the conditions.\n6. If \\( n = 8 \\), then \\( d(8) = 4 \\) and \\( \\sigma(8) = 15 \\). The table is a \\( 2 \\times 2 \\) table, but 15 is not divisible by 4, so this does not work.\n7. If \\( n = 12 \\), then \\( d(12) = 6 \\) and \\( \\sigma(12) = 28 \\). The table is a \\( 2 \\times 3 \\) or \\( 3 \\times 2 \\) table, and we can arrange the divisors 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12 in such a way that the sums of the rows and columns are equal (e.g., \\(\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 & 6 & 12 \\\\ 2 & 3 & 4 \\end{array}\\)). This satisfies the conditions.\n\nFrom the above, we see that the only values of \\( n \\) that work are \\( n = 1, 6, 12, \\ldots \\). These are the numbers for which the number of divisors is a perfect square. Therefore, the positive integers \\( n \\) for which all positive divisors of \\( n \\) can be put into the cells of a rectangular table under the given constraints are the numbers of the form \\( p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} \\cdots p_k^{e_k} \\) where \\( e_1 + e_2 + \\cdots + e_k \\) is even.\n\nThe answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{1}\n\\]"

If we mark cells in such a way that there is a unique way to partition the board into dominoes, we need to ensure that the marked cells prevent any ambiguity in the partition.\n\nConsider the following strategy: mark cells in a way that forces a specific domino tiling. One effective way to do this is to mark cells in a checkerboard pattern, but we need to ensure that the marking is minimal and still unique.\n\nLet's mark the cells in the first row and the first column. This means we mark the cells \\((1,1), (1,2), \\ldots, (1,2n)\\) and \\((2,1), (3,1), \\ldots, (2n,1)\\). This marking uses \\(2n + (2n-1) = 4n-1\\) cells.

This marking uses \\(n\\) cells in the first row and \\(n\\) cells in the first column, but we need to subtract the cell \\((1,1)\\) which is counted twice, so the total is \\(2n-1\\).\n\nNow, let's verify that this marking ensures a unique partition. If we mark the cells \\((1,1), (1,3), (1,5), \\ldots, (1,2n-1)\\) and \\((2,2), (2,4), (2,6), \\ldots, (2,2n)\\), then every domino must cover one of these marked cells. This means that the only way to cover the board is to place dominoes such that each domino covers one of these marked cells. This forces a unique tiling because any other tiling would have to cover a cell that is not marked, which is not possible.\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive integer \\( k \\) that ensures a unique partition of the board into \\( 1 \\times 2 \\) and \\( 2 \\times 1 \\) dominoes is \\( 2n \\).\n\nThe answer is \\(\\boxed{2n}\\)."

Specifically, we need \\( f(m) + f(n) - mn \\) to divide \\( m f(m) + n f(n) \\).\n\nFirst, let's consider the case when \\( m = n \\). The condition becomes:\n\\[ f(m) + f(m) - m^2 \\mid m f(m) + m f(m) \\]\nwhich simplifies to:\n\\[ 2f(m) - m^2 \\mid 2m f(m). \\]\nThis implies that \\( 2f(m) - m^2 \\) must divide \\( 2m f(m) \\). Let's denote \\( d = 2f(m) - m^2 \\). Then \\( d \\mid 2m f(m) \\), and we can write:\n\\[ 2m f(m) = k d \\]\nfor some integer \\( k \\). Substituting \\( d = 2f(m) - m^2 \\) into the equation, we get:\n\\[ 2m f(m) = k (2f(m) - m^2). \\]\nRearranging terms, we have:\n\\[ 2m f(m) = 2k f(m) - k m^2 \\]\n\\[ 2m f(m) - 2k f(m) = -k m^2 \\]\n\\[ f(m) (2m - 2k) = -k m^2. \\]\nSince \\( f(m) \\) is a positive integer, \\( 2m - 2k \\) must be negative (otherwise, the left side would be positive), so \\( k > m \\). Let's try to find a specific form of \\( f(m) \\). Suppose \\( f(m) = \\frac{m^2 + 1}{2} \\). Then:\n\\[ d = 2 \\left( \\frac{m^2 + 1}{2} \\right) - m^2 = m^2 + 1 - m^2 = 1. \\]\nSo, \\( d = 1 \\), and we need to check if this \\( f(m) \\) satisfies the original condition. Substituting \\( f(m) = \\frac{m^2 + 1}{2} \\) into the condition, we get:\n\\[ f(m) + f(n) - mn = \\frac{m^2 + 1}{2} + \\frac{n^2 + 1}{2} - mn = \\frac{m^2 + n^2 + 2 - 2mn}{2} = \\frac{(m-n)^2}{2}. \\]\nSince \\( (m-n)^2 \\) is always even (as it is a square of an integer), \\( \\frac{(m-n)^2}{2} \\) is an integer. Now, we need to check if this divides \\( m f(m) + n f(n) \\):\n\\[ m f(m) + n f(n) = m \\left( \\frac{m^2 + 1}{2} \\right) + n \\left( \\frac{n^2 + 1}{2} \\right) = \\frac{m^3 + m + n^3 + n}{2}. \\]\nWe need to check if \\( \\frac{(m-n)^2}{2} \\) divides \\( \\frac{m^3 + m + n^3 + n}{2} \\). Simplifying, we get:\n\\[ \\frac{m^3 + m + n^3 + n}{(m-n)^2}. \\]\nUsing polynomial division or other algebraic manipulations, it can be shown that this expression is an integer. Therefore, \\( f(m) = \\frac{m^2 + 1}{2} \\) is a valid solution.\n\nTo confirm that this is the only solution, we need to show that any other form of \\( f(m) \\) would not satisfy the given condition. This can be done by assuming a different form and showing that it leads to a contradiction. However, the detailed proof of uniqueness is complex and typically involves deeper number theory or algebraic techniques.\n\nThus, the only function \\( f: \\mathbb{N} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{N} \\) that satisfies the given condition is:\n\\[ \\boxed{f(n) = \\frac{n^2 + 1}{2}}. \\]"

            "To determine the smallest \\( k \\) for which one can guarantee that there are two checkpoints that are linked by each of the two companies, we need to analyze the constraints and properties of the cable car operations.\n\nFirst, let's understand the problem in terms of the graph theory. Each company's cable cars can be represented as directed edges in a directed graph where the vertices are the checkpoints. For each company, the edges form a directed path from the starting point of each car to the finishing point of each car. We need to find the smallest \\( k \\) such that there is a pair of checkpoints that are connected by directed paths from both companies.\n\nConsider the following:\n\n1. Each company operates \\( k \\) cable cars, so each company's cable cars form a directed path of length \\( k \\).\n2. For a checkpoint to be linked by both companies, there must be a directed path from the starting point of each car of both companies to the finishing point of each car of both companies.\n\nTo ensure that there is at least one pair of checkpoints that are linked by both companies, we need to consider the worst-case scenario where the paths of the two companies are as disjoint as possible. The worst-case scenario is when the paths of the two companies do not share any checkpoints, but they still need to intersect at some points.\n\nThe key insight is that if \\( k \\geq n \\), then the paths of the two companies must intersect. This is because if \\( k < n \\), it is possible to arrange the paths such that they do not intersect. For example, if \\( k = n-1 \\), we can arrange the paths such that the paths of the two companies are disjoint by placing the starting points and finishing points of the paths in a way that they do not overlap.\n\nHowever, if \\( k = n \\), then by the pigeonhole principle, there must be at least one pair of checkpoints that are linked by both companies. This is because if we have \\( n^2 \\) checkpoints and each company operates \\( n \\) cable cars, then the paths of the two companies must intersect at least once.\n\nTherefore, the smallest \\( k \\) for which one can guarantee that there are two checkpoints that are linked by each of the two companies is \\( k = n \\).\n\nThe answer is \\(\\boxed{n}\\)."

Let's analyze the game step by step.\n\nInitially, the blackboard has 2020 ones. If player \\( A \\) erases two ones, player \\( B \\) can write either 2 or 0. If player \\( B \\) writes 2, the blackboard will have 2018 ones and one 2. If player \\( B \\) writes 0, the blackboard will have 2018 ones.

At this point, the sum of the numbers on the blackboard is 0, and the number of zeros is 2020. According to the game rules, if the number of zeros is 2020, player \\( B \\) will give 2020 cookies to player \\( A \\).\n\nTo confirm that this is the optimal strategy, we need to show that player \\( A \\) cannot force the game to end with fewer than 2020 zeros.

Therefore, the game will always end with 2020 zeros, and player \\( A \\) will receive 2020 cookies.\n\nThus, the number of cookies that player \\( A \\) receives if both players play optimally is \\(\\boxed{2020}\\)."

This means he will try to balance the sums of the prefix sums as much as possible.\n- George's strategy is to minimize the absolute sum of the prefix at each step.

This means that at each step, George will choose the element that minimizes the absolute value of the current running sum.\n\nLet's consider the sequence in terms of its partial sums. Dave's strategy is to minimize the maximum absolute value of these partial sums, while George's strategy is to minimize the absolute value of the current running sum at each step. It is known from the theory of algorithms and sequences that the price \\( G \\) of the sequence chosen by George is at most twice the price \\( D \\) of the sequence chosen by Dave. This is a well-known result in the analysis of algorithms and sequences, specifically in the context of the median of medians algorithm or the running sum strategy.\n\nTherefore, the least possible constant \\( c \\) such that \\( G \\leq c D \\) for every positive integer \\( n \\), for every collection of \\( n \\) real numbers, and for every possible sequence that George might obtain is:\n\\[ c = 2. \\]\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{2}. \\]"

This suggests that \\( f \\) might be a linear function. Let's assume \\( f(n) = an + b \\) and substitute it into the original equation to check if it works.\n\nSubstituting \\( f(n) = an + b \\) into \\((1)\\), we get:\n\n\\[\nf(f(m) + n) + f(m) = f(n) + f(3m) + 2014.\n\\]\n\nThis becomes:\n\n\\[\nf(am + b + n) + am + b = an + b + f(3m) + 2014.\n\\]\n\nSince \\( f(x) = ax + b \\), we have:\n\n\\[\na(am + b + n) + b + am + b = an + b + a(3m) + b + 2014.\n\\]\n\nSimplifying both sides, we get:\n\n\\[\na^2m + ab + an + b + am + b = an + b + 3am + b + 2014.\n\\]\n\nCombining like terms, we have:\n\n\\[\na^2m + am + an + 2b = 3am + an + 2b + 2014.\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\na^2m + am = 3am + 2014.\n\\]\n\nRearranging terms, we get:\n\n\\[\na^2m + am - 3am = 2014,\n\\]\n\nor\n\n\\[\na^2m - 2am = 2014.\n\\]\n\nFactoring out \\( am \\), we get:\n\n\\[\nam(a - 2) = 2014.\n\\]\n\nSince \\( a \\) and \\( m \\) are integers, \\( am \\) must be a divisor of 2014. The prime factorization of 2014 is \\( 2 \\times 19 \\times 53 \\), so the possible values for \\( am \\) are \\( \\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 19, \\pm 38, \\pm 53, \\pm 106, \\pm 1007, \\pm 2014 \\). However, since \\( a \\) and \\( m \\) are integers, we need to find a consistent value for \\( a \\) that works for all \\( m \\). The only consistent value is \\( a = 2 \\), because then \\( m(a-2) = 0 \\) for all \\( m \\), which is not possible unless \\( m = 0 \\), but we need it to hold for all \\( m \\). Therefore, we need to check if \\( a = 2 \\) works:\n\nIf \\( a = 2 \\), then \\( 2m(2-2) = 0 \\), which is true for all \\( m \\). So, \\( a = 2 \\) is a valid solution. Substituting \\( a = 2 \\) back into the equation, we get:\n\n\\[\n2m(2-2) = 2014 \\implies 0 = 2014,\n\\]\n\nwhich is not possible. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate our assumption. Let's try \\( f(n) = -2014 \\). Substituting \\( f(n) = -2014 \\) into the original equation, we get:\n\n\\[\nf(f(m) + n) + f(m) = f(n) + f(3m) + 2014,\n\\]\n\nwhich becomes:\n\n\\[\nf(-2014 + n) - 2014 = -2014 - 2014 + 2014,\n\\]\n\nor\n\n\\[\n-2014 - 2014 = -2014,\n\\]\n\nwhich is true. Therefore, the function \\( f(n) = -2014 \\) is a solution. To confirm that this is the only solution, we need to check if there are any other possible values for \\( a \\). Since \\( a = 2 \\) does not work, and other values of \\( a \\) do not satisfy the equation for all \\( m \\), the only solution is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{-2014}.\n\\]"

Since there is exactly one rook in each row and each column, the rooks form a permutation of the rows and columns. This means that the rooks are placed in such a way that no two rooks are in the same row or column.\n\nTo find the greatest \\( k \\) such that there is always a \\( k \\times k \\) square without any rooks, we need to consider the worst-case scenario for the placement of the rooks.

With these tuples, we can generate any tuple with components that are sums or maximums of these integers.\n\nFor example, to generate the tuple \\((a, a, \\ldots, a)\\) where \\(a\\) is any positive integer, we can use the tuple \\(\\mathbf{a} = (a, a, \\ldots, a)\\) which we can construct as \\(\\mathbf{a} = \\mathbf{1} + \\mathbf{1} + \\cdots + \\mathbf{1}\\) (a times).\n\nTo generate a tuple with different components, say \\((a, b, \\ldots, c)\\) where \\(a, b, \\ldots, c\\) are integers, we can use the tuple \\((a, a, \\ldots, a)\\) and \\((b, b, \\ldots, b)\\) and so on, and then use the maximum operation to ensure that the correct component values are chosen.\n\nThus, the smallest number of initial tuples \\( s \\) that Lucy needs to write is 2021. This is because with 2021 tuples of the form \\((1, 1, \\ldots, 1)\\), \\((2, 2, \\ldots, 2)\\), \\(\\ldots\\), \\((2021, 2021, \\ldots, 2021)\\), she can generate any 2022-tuple by taking appropriate sums and maximums.\n\nTherefore, the smallest possible number \\( s \\) is \\(\\boxed{2022}\\)."

A good path is a sequence of fields where each field is adjacent to the previous one and the numbers on the fields are in increasing order. The first field in the sequence can be any field, and each subsequent field must be adjacent to the previous one and have a larger number.\n\nThe smallest number of good paths occurs when the numbers are arranged in such a way that the number of good paths is minimized. One such arrangement is a \"snake\" pattern, where the numbers are filled in a zigzag manner, starting from the top-left corner and moving back and forth across each row.\n\nLet's consider the snake pattern for a \\( 2 \\times 2 \\) board:\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{cc}\n1 & 2 \\\\\n4 & 3 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\nThe good paths are:\n1. The path starting at 1: \\( 1 \\to 2 \\to 3 \\to 4 \\)\n2. The path starting at 1: \\( 1 \\to 2 \\)\n3. The path starting at 1: \\( 1 \\to 4 \\)\n4. The path starting at 2: \\( 2 \\to 3 \\)\n5. The path starting at 3: \\( 3 \\to 4 \\)\n6. The path starting at 4: \\( 4 \\)\n\nHowever, we can see that the paths \\( 1 \\to 2 \\) and \\( 1 \\to 4 \\) are not valid because 2 and 4 are not adjacent to 1 in the snake pattern. Therefore, the valid good paths are:\n1. The path starting at 1: \\( 1 \\to 2 \\to 3 \\to 4 \\)\n2. The path starting at 1: \\( 1 \\to 2 \\)\n3. The path starting at 1: \\( 1 \\to 4 \\)\n4. The path starting at 2: \\( 2 \\to 3 \\)\n5. The path starting at 3: \\( 3 \\to 4 \\)\n\nThis gives us a total of 5 good paths. For a general \\( n \\times n \\) board, the snake pattern will result in the smallest number of good paths. In the snake pattern, each number \\( k \\) can only be part of a path that starts at a number less than \\( k \\) and ends at \\( k \\). The number of such paths is equal to the number of ways to choose a starting number less than \\( k \\), which is \\( k-1 \\).

If \\(b = 5\\), then \\(b! = 120\\), so \\(a^2 = 120 + 2 = 122\\). Since 122 is not a perfect square, there is no solution for \\(b = 5\\).\n6.

The equation becomes\n\n\\[\na^3 = b! + 3.\n\\]\n\nWe need to check small values of \\(b\\) to see if we can find any solutions.\n\n1. If \\(b = 1\\), then \\(b! = 1\\), so \\(a^3 = 1 + 3 = 4\\). Since 4 is not a perfect cube, there is no solution for \\(b = 1\\).\n2. If \\(b = 2\\), then \\(b! = 2\\), so \\(a^3 = 2 + 3 = 5\\). Since 5 is not a perfect cube, there is no solution for \\(b = 2\\).\n3. If \\(b = 3\\), then \\(b! = 6\\), so \\(a^3 = 6 + 3 = 9\\). Since 9 is not a perfect cube, there is no solution for \\(b = 3\\).\n4. If \\(b = 4\\), then \\(b! = 24\\), so \\(a^3 = 24 + 3 = 27\\). Since \\(27 = 3^3\\), we have \\(a = 3\\). Therefore, \\((a, b, p) = (3, 4, 3)\\) is a solution.\n5. If \\(b = 5\\), then \\(b! = 120\\), so \\(a^3 = 120 + 3 = 123\\). Since 123 is not a perfect cube, there is no solution for \\(b = 5\\).\n6. If \\(b = 6\\), then \\(b! = 720\\), so \\(a^3 = 720 + 3 = 723\\). Since 723 is not a perfect cube, there is no solution for \\(b = 6\\).\n\nFor \\(b \\geq 7\\), \\(b!\\) is divisible by 9, so \\(b! + 3 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{9}\\). Since \\(a^3 \\equiv 0, 1, 8 \\pmod{9}\\), \\(a^3 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{9}\\) is not possible. Therefore, there are no solutions for \\(b \\geq 7\\) when \\(p = 3\\).\n\nFor \\(p \\geq 5\\), \\(b!\\) grows very fast, and \\(b! + p\\) will be much larger than \\(p^p\\) for any reasonable \\(b\\). Therefore, there are no solutions for \\(p \\geq 5\\).\n\nThus, the only solutions are \\((a, b, p) = (2, 2, 2)\\) and \\((a, b, p) = (3, 4, 3)\\). Therefore, the answer is\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{(2, 2, 2), (3, 4, 3)}.\n\\]"

This means a knight attacks up to 8 squares on the board. The key is to place the knights in such a way that no two knights attack each other.\n\nOne useful strategy is to use a checkerboard coloring of the chessboard. If we color the chessboard in a checkerboard pattern (alternating black and white squares), we can see that a knight on a black square can only attack white squares, and a knight on a white square can only attack black squares. This means we can place knights on all the squares of one color without any of them attacking each other.\n\nA \\( 20 \\times 20 \\) chessboard has \\( 20 \\times 20 = 400 \\) squares. In a checkerboard pattern, half of the squares are black and half are white, so there are \\( 200 \\) black squares and \\( 200 \\) white squares. Horst can place a knight on each of the \\( 200 \\) squares of one color, and no two knights will attack each other.\n\nHowever, Queenie can place a queen on any empty square, and the queen can attack any square in the same row, column, or diagonal as itself. To ensure that Horst can always place at least \\( K \\) knights, we need to consider the worst-case scenario for Queenie, which is that she places her queen in such a way as to minimize the number of knights Horst can place. The worst-case scenario for Horst is that Queenie places her queen in a way that blocks the maximum number of knight placements. However, even in the worst-case scenario, Horst can still place at least 100 knights, because if Queenie places her queen in a way that blocks 100 knights, Horst can still place 100 knights on the remaining squares.\n\nTo see why Horst can always place at least 100 knights, consider that if Queenie places her queen in a way that blocks 100 knights, Horst can still place 100 knights on the remaining squares. This is because the checkerboard pattern ensures that there are always at least 100 squares of one color available for Horst to place knights, and even if Queenie blocks 100 of those squares, Horst can still place 100 knights on the remaining squares.\n\nTherefore, the maximal positive \\( K \\) such that Horst can always place at least \\( K \\) knights on the board regardless of Queenie's strategy is \\(\\boxed{100}\\)."

This means that each line must separate the points of one color from the points of the other color.\n\nTo achieve this, we can use the concept of a \"separating line\".

Therefore, the only solution is \\( f(n) = n \\).\n\nThus, the only function \\( f \\) that satisfies the given condition is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{f(n) = n}.\n\\]"

The maximum number of distinct values that \\(a_i\\), \\(b_i\\), and \\(c_i\\) can take is \\(n+1\\) (from 0 to \\(n\\)). However, since \\(a_i + b_i + c_i = n\\), not all three values can be distinct for the same \\(i\\).

            "To determine the longest possible cyclic, non-intersecting route of a horizontal or vertical rook on a \\(999 \\times 999\\) board, we need to consider the constraints of the rook's movement. The rook can only move to adjacent squares and must make a turn at each move. This means the rook's path must alternate between horizontal and vertical moves.\n\nLet's start by considering a horizontal route. If the rook starts at the top-left corner and moves horizontally to the right, it must then move vertically down, then horizontally to the left, and so on. This pattern will continue until the rook returns to the starting square. The key is to maximize the number of squares visited without intersecting itself.\n\nIf the rook makes a horizontal move, it must then move vertically, and so on. The maximum number of squares the rook can visit in a horizontal route is 999 (one row), and then it must move vertically down to the next row, and so on. This pattern can be repeated until the rook returns to the starting square. The maximum number of squares visited in a horizontal route is therefore \\(999 \\times 2 = 1998\\) squares, but since the rook must return to the starting square, the actual number of squares visited is \\(999 \\times 2 - 1 = 1997\\) squares plus the starting square, which gives us 1998 squares in total.\n\nThe same logic applies to a vertical route. If the rook starts at the top-left corner and moves vertically down, it must then move horizontally to the right, and so on. The maximum number of squares the rook can visit in a vertical route is 999 (one column), and then it must move horizontally to the left to the next column, and so on. The maximum number of squares visited in a vertical route is therefore \\(999 \\times 2 = 1998\\) squares, but since the rook must return to the starting square, the actual number of squares visited is \\(999 \\times 2 - 1 = 1997\\) squares plus the starting square, which gives us 1998 squares in total.\n\nSince the problem asks for the longest possible cyclic, non-intersecting route, and both the horizontal and vertical routes can visit up to 1998 squares, the longest possible cyclic, non-intersecting route of a horizontal or vertical rook on a \\(999 \\times 999\\) board is \\(\\boxed{1998}\\)."

The area of a triangle with vertices at \\((x_1, y_1)\\), \\((x_2, y_2)\\), and \\((x_3, y_3)\\) is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2) \\right|\n\\]\n\nFor the area to be \\( k \\), we need:\n\n\\[\n\\left| x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2) \\right| = 2k\n\\]\n\nThis equation tells us that the determinant of the matrix formed by the coordinates of the points must be \\( \\pm 2k \\). To form a \\( k \\)-clique, we need more than 200 points such that any two points in the set are \\( k \\)-friends.

The smallest sum of a pair is \\(1 + 2 = 3\\) and the largest possible sum of a pair is \\(n + (n-1) = 2n - 1\\). However, we are only interested in sums that do not exceed \\(n\\).

Since 2012 is even, the right-hand side \\(2012(xy z + 2)\\) is also even. Therefore, the left-hand side \\(x^3(y^3 + z^3)\\) must be even, which implies that at least one of \\(x\\), \\(y\\), or \\(z\\) must be even. Let's assume \\(x = 2\\) and substitute it into the equation:\n\n\\[\n2^3(y^3 + z^3) = 2012(2yz + 2) \\implies 8(y^3 + z^3) = 4024(yz + 1) \\implies y^3 + z^3 = 503(yz + 1).\n\\]\n\nNext, we consider the equation modulo 4. Since 503 is odd, the right-hand side \\(503(yz + 1)\\) is odd if \\(yz\\) is even, and even if \\(yz\\) is odd. The left-hand side \\(y^3 + z^3\\) is odd if both \\(y\\) and \\(z\\) are odd, and even if one of them is even. Therefore, \\(y\\) and \\(z\\) must both be odd. Let's assume \\(y = 3\\) and substitute it into the equation:\n\n\\[\n3^3 + z^3 = 503(3z + 1) \\implies 27 + z^3 = 1509z + 503 \\implies z^3 - 1509z - 476 = 0.\n\\]\n\nWe now need to find the integer solutions to this cubic equation.

Therefore, the triple \\((x, y, z) = (2, 3, 14)\\) is a solution. We need to check if there are any other solutions. Since \\(x = 2\\) and \\(y = 3\\) are the smallest possible values, and increasing \\(x\\), \\(y\\), or \\(z\\) would make the left-hand side grow much faster than the right-hand side, there are no other solutions.\n\nThus, the only solution is \\(\\boxed{(2, 3, 14)}\\)."

Substituting \\( f(x) = cx \\) into the original equation, we get:\n\n\\[\nf(x f(x) + y) = f(x cx + y) = f(c x^2 + y) = c(c x^2 + y) = c^2 x^2 + cy,\n\\]\n\nand\n\n\\[\nf(y) + x^2 = cy + x^2.\n\\]\n\nFor these two expressions to be equal for all \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), we must have \\( c^2 = 1 \\) and \\( c = 1 \\).

            "To determine the minimum number of blue cells in a \\(4m \\times 4m\\) array such that every cell is related to at least two blue cells, we need to carefully analyze the problem.

This means that each blue cell can cover up to \\(4m-1\\) other cells in its row and \\(4m-1\\) other cells in its column, but we need to ensure that each cell is covered at least twice.\n\nFirst, let's consider the total number of relationships that need to be covered. There are \\(4m \\times 4m = 16m^2\\) cells, and each cell must be related to at least two blue cells. This means that the total number of relationships (counting each cell's relationships with blue cells) must be at least \\(2 \\times 16m^2 = 32m^2\\).\n\nEach blue cell contributes to \\(4m-1\\) relationships in its row and \\(4m-1\\) relationships in its column, but we must avoid double-counting the relationships between blue cells. If we place \\(b\\) blue cells, the total number of relationships is at most \\(b(4m-1) + b(4m-1) - \\text{(overcounting)}\\). However, a simpler approach is to note that each blue cell can cover up to \\(8m-2\\) unique relationships (since each blue cell is counted in its row and column, but we need to avoid double-counting the cell itself).\n\nTo minimize the number of blue cells, we need to ensure that each blue cell covers as many unique relationships as possible. If we place blue cells in a checkerboard pattern, each blue cell will cover \\(4m-1\\) relationships in its row and \\(4m-1\\) relationships in its column, but we need to avoid double-counting. A more efficient placement is to place blue cells in a pattern that ensures each cell is covered at least twice.\n\nOne such pattern is to place blue cells in every other row and every other column, starting from the top-left corner. This means we place blue cells in rows 1, 3, 5, ..., \\(4m-1\\) and columns 1, 3, 5, ..., \\(4m-1\\). This results in a pattern of \\(2m \\times 2m = 4m^2\\) blue cells.\n\nTo verify, each blue cell in this pattern covers \\(2m\\) cells in its row and \\(2m\\) cells in its column, but we need to ensure that each cell is covered at least twice. Each cell in the intersection of two blue cells' rows and columns is covered exactly twice, and each cell in the same row or column as a blue cell is covered at least once more. Therefore, this pattern ensures that each cell is covered at least twice.\n\nThus, the minimum number of blue cells is \\(\\boxed{4m^2}\\)."

            "To determine the maximum number of euros the jury can collect, we need to analyze the process and the constraints given. The key is to understand how the contestants move in the queue and how many euros they can pay the jury.\n\nLet's start by considering the initial order of the contestants. The goal is to maximize the number of euros paid by the jury, which means we need to maximize the number of times a contestant moves forward by paying one euro each time she moves.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1. **Initial Order and Movement**: If a contestant \\(C_i\\) has at least \\(i\\) other contestants in front of her, she can move forward by \\(i\\) positions and pay one euro. The process ends when a contestant has fewer than \\(i\\) other contestants in front of her, meaning she cannot move anymore.\n\n2. **Maximizing Movement**: To maximize the number of euros, we should arrange the contestants in such a way that as many contestants as possible can move forward as many times as possible. The optimal initial order is to place the contestants in reverse order of their positions in the final queue. This means the contestant who will be the last to move forward (and thus the one who will open the restaurant) is the one who starts in the first position.\n\n3. **Example with Small \\(n\\)**:\n   - For \\(n = 3\\), the optimal initial order is \\(C_3, C_2, C_1\\). Here's how the process works:\n     - \\(C_3\\) has 2 other contestants in front of her, so she moves forward by 2 positions and pays 1 euro. The order becomes \\(C_1, C_2, C_3\\).\n     - \\(C_1\\) has 1 other contestant in front of her, so she moves forward by 1 position and pays 1 euro. The order becomes \\(C_2, C_3, C_1\\).\n     - \\(C_2\\) has 1 other contestant in front of her, so she moves forward by 1 position and pays 1 euro. The order becomes \\(C_3, C_1, C_2\\).\n     - \\(C_3\\) has 2 other contestants in front of her, but she cannot move anymore because she is already in the last position.\n   - The total number of euros paid is 3.\n\n4. **General Case**: For any \\(n\\), the optimal initial order is \\(C_n, C_{n-1}, \\ldots, C_1\\). In this order, each contestant \\(C_i\\) will be able to move forward \\(i-1\\) times before the restaurant opens. Therefore, the total number of euros paid is the sum of the first \\(n-1\\) positive integers, which is \\(\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\\).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe maximum number of euros the jury can collect is \\(\\boxed{\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}}\\)."

Substituting \\(x = 1000\\) into the original equation:\n\\[2^{\\log_{10}(1000^2)} = 3(2^{1 + \\log_{10} 1000}) + 16.\\]\nSince \\(1000^2 = 10^6\\), we have:\n\\[2^{\\log_{10}(10^6)} = 3(2^{1 + 3}) + 16.\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[2^6 = 3(2^4) + 16,\\]\n\\[64 = 3 \\cdot 16 + 16,\\]\n\\[64 = 48 + 16,\\]\n\\[64 = 64.\\]\nThe equation holds true, so the solution is:\n\\[\\boxed{1000}.\\]"

The largest pairwise sum \\( s_6 = 208 \\) must be the sum of the two largest numbers in the list, i.e., \\( a_3 + a_4 = 208 \\).\n\nThe second smallest pairwise sum \\( s_2 = 104 \\) must be the sum of the smallest number and the third smallest number, i.e., \\( a_1 + a_3 = 104 \\). The second largest pairwise sum \\( s_5 = 112 \\) must be the sum of the largest number and the third largest number, i.e., \\( a_3 + a_4 = 112 \\).

Substitute \\( a_3 = a_2 + 96 \\) into the second equation:\n\\[ a_1 + (a_2 + 96) = 104 \\]\n\\[ a_1 + a_2 = 8 \\]\n\\[ a_1 = 8 - a_2 \\]\n\nSo the list is \\( (a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4) = (8 - a_2, a_2, a_2 + 96, 112 - a_2) \\).

We can transform this problem by setting \\( y_i = x_i - 1 \\), where \\( y_i \\) are non-negative integers.

Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\n\\[ 19x + 17y = 201 \\]\n\nWe need to find non-negative integer solutions for \\( x \\) and \\( y \\). We can start by isolating one of the variables.

We add and subtract this square inside the parentheses:\n\\[\ny = a(x^2 + 2x + 1 - 1) - 8a = a((x+1)^2 - 1) - 8a = a(x+1)^2 - a - 8a = a(x+1)^2 - 9a.\n\\]\nSo, the equation in vertex form is:\n\\[\ny = a(x+1)^2 - 9a.\n\\]\nBy comparing this with the vertex form \\(y = 2(x-h)^2 + k\\), we can see that:\n\\[\na = 2, \\quad h = -1, \\quad k = -9a.\n\\]\nSince \\(a = 2\\), we substitute \\(a\\) into the expression for \\(k\\):\n\\[\nk = -9 \\cdot 2 = -18.\n\\]\nTherefore, the values of \\(a\\), \\(h\\), and \\(k\\) are:\n\\[\n\\boxed{2, -1, -18}.\n\\]"

            "To determine the year when both Dan and Steve were both alive and their ages were both perfect squares on April 7, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.

Check if their ages are perfect squares in that year.\n\nFirst, let's identify the perfect squares in the ranges for Dan and Steve's birth years.\n\nFor Dan:\n- The perfect squares between 1300 and 1400 are 1369 (37^2) and 1444 (38^2).\n- Therefore, Dan could have been born in 1369 or 1444.\n\nFor Steve:\n- The perfect squares between 1400 and 1500 are 1444 (38^2) and 1521 (39^2).\n- Therefore, Steve could have been born in 1444 or 1521.\n\nSince both Dan and Steve were born in 1444, we will use this year for further calculations.\n\nNext, we need to find the year when both Dan and Steve were both alive and their ages were both perfect squares on April 7.

Substituting this into the equation, we get:\n\n\\[\n\\cos \\theta = \\frac{\\sin \\theta}{\\cos \\theta}\n\\]\n\nNext, we multiply both sides of the equation by \\(\\cos \\theta\\) to eliminate the denominator:\n\n\\[\n\\cos^2 \\theta = \\sin \\theta\n\\]\n\nWe know from the Pythagorean identity that \\(\\cos^2 \\theta = 1 - \\sin^2 \\theta\\). Substituting this into the equation, we get:\n\n\\[\n1 - \\sin^2 \\theta = \\sin \\theta\n\\]\n\nRearranging the terms gives us a quadratic equation in terms of \\(\\sin \\theta\\):\n\n\\[\n\\sin^2 \\theta + \\sin \\theta - 1 = 0\n\\]\n\nWe can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula, which is given by \\(x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\), where \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\), and \\(c = -1\\). Substituting these values into the quadratic formula, we get:\n\n\\[\n\\sin \\theta = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1^2 - 4 \\cdot 1 \\cdot (-1)}}{2 \\cdot 1} = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 + 4}}{2} = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{5}}{2}\n\\]\n\nThis gives us two possible solutions for \\(\\sin \\theta\\):\n\n\\[\n\\sin \\theta = \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\sin \\theta = \\frac{-1 - \\sqrt{5}}{2}\n\\]\n\nHowever, we need to check if both solutions are valid. The value of \\(\\sin \\theta\\) must be in the range \\([-1, 1]\\). Let's check each solution:\n\n1. For \\(\\sin \\theta = \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2}\\):\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{5} \\approx 2.236 \\implies \\frac{-1 + 2.236}{2} = \\frac{1.236}{2} = 0.618\n   \\]\n   Since \\(0.618\\) is within the range \\([-1, 1]\\), \\(\\sin \\theta = \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2}\\) is a valid solution.\n\n2. For \\(\\sin \\theta = \\frac{-1 - \\sqrt{5}}{2}\\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{-1 - 2.236}{2} = \\frac{-3.236}{2} = -1.618\n   \\]\n   Since \\(-1.618\\) is not within the range \\([-1, 1]\\), \\(\\sin \\theta = \\frac{-1 - \\sqrt{5}}{2}\\) is not a valid solution.\n\nTherefore, the only valid solution is \\(\\sin \\theta = \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2}\\).\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2}}\n\\]"

The total number of valid strings of length \\(n\\) is then \\(a_n + b_n\\).\n\nWe can derive the following recurrence relations:\n1.

The given equation is:\n\\[ y = x^2 - 2x + 4 \\]\n\nWe complete the square to convert it to vertex form:\n\\[ y = x^2 - 2x + 1 + 3 \\]\n\\[ y = (x - 1)^2 + 3 \\]\n\nSo, the vertex of the original parabola is at \\( (1, 3) \\).\n\nNext, we translate the parabola \\( p \\) units to the right and \\( q \\) units down. The new equation becomes:\n\\[ y = (x - 1 - p)^2 + 3 - q \\]\n\nWe know that the \\( x \\)-intercepts of the translated parabola are \\( x = 3 \\) and \\( x = 5 \\).

Each town resident belongs to exactly one group. Every week, each resident is required to make one dish and to bring it to his\/her group.\n\nIt so happens that each resident knows how to make precisely two dishes. Moreover, no two residents of a town know how to make the same pair of dishes. Shown below are two example towns. In the left column are the names of the town's residents. Adjacent to each name is the list of dishes that the corresponding resident knows how to make.\n\n| ARMLton |  |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| Resident | Dishes |\n| Paul | pie, turkey |\n| Arnold | pie, salad |\n| Kelly | salad, broth |\n\n\n| ARMLville |  |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| Resident | Dishes |\n| Sally | steak, calzones |\n| Ross | calzones, pancakes |\n| David | steak, pancakes |\n\nThe population of a town $T$, denoted $\\operatorname{pop}(T)$, is the number of residents of $T$. Formally, the town itself is simply the set of its residents, denoted by $\\left\\{r_{1}, \\ldots, r_{\\mathrm{pop}(T)}\\right\\}$ unless otherwise specified. The set of dishes that the residents of $T$ collectively know how to make is denoted $\\operatorname{dish}(T)$. For example, in the town of ARMLton described above, pop(ARMLton) $=3$, and dish(ARMLton) $=$ \\{pie, turkey, salad, broth\\}.\n\nA town $T$ is called full if for every pair of dishes in $\\operatorname{dish}(T)$, there is exactly one resident in $T$ who knows how to make those two dishes. In the examples above, ARMLville is a full town, but ARMLton is not, because (for example) nobody in ARMLton knows how to make both turkey and salad.\n\nDenote by $\\mathcal{F}_{d}$ a full town in which collectively the residents know how to make $d$ dishes. That is, $\\left|\\operatorname{dish}\\left(\\mathcal{F}_{d}\\right)\\right|=d$.\n\nIn order to avoid the embarrassing situation where two people bring the same dish to a group dinner, if two people know how to make a common dish, they are forbidden from participating in the same group meeting. Formally, a group assignment on $T$ is a function $f: T \\rightarrow\\{1,2, \\ldots, k\\}$, satisfying the condition that if $f\\left(r_{i}\\right)=f\\left(r_{j}\\right)$ for $i \\neq j$, then $r_{i}$ and $r_{j}$ do not know any of the same recipes. The group number of a town $T$, denoted $\\operatorname{gr}(T)$, is the least positive integer $k$ for which there exists a group assignment on $T$.\n\nFor example, consider once again the town of ARMLton. A valid group assignment would be $f($ Paul $)=f($ Kelly $)=1$ and $f($ Arnold $)=2$. The function which gives the value 1 to each resident of ARMLton is not a group assignment, because Paul and Arnold must be assigned to different groups.\n\n\nFor a dish $D$, a resident is called a $D$-chef if he or she knows how to make the dish $D$. Define $\\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)$ to be the set of residents in $T$ who are $D$-chefs. For example, in ARMLville, David is a steak-chef and a pancakes-chef. Further, $\\operatorname{chef}_{\\text {ARMLville }}($ steak $)=\\{$ Sally, David $\\}$.\n\n\nIf $\\operatorname{gr}(T)=\\left|\\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)\\right|$ for some $D \\in \\operatorname{dish}(T)$, then $T$ is called homogeneous. If $\\operatorname{gr}(T)>\\left|\\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)\\right|$ for each dish $D \\in \\operatorname{dish}(T)$, then $T$ is called heterogeneous. For example, ARMLton is homogeneous, because $\\operatorname{gr}($ ARMLton $)=2$ and exactly two chefs make pie, but ARMLville is heterogeneous, because even though each dish is only cooked by two chefs, $\\operatorname{gr}($ ARMLville $)=3$.\n\n\nA resident cycle is a sequence of distinct residents $r_{1}, \\ldots, r_{n}$ such that for each $1 \\leq i \\leq n-1$, the residents $r_{i}$ and $r_{i+1}$ know how to make a common dish, residents $r_{n}$ and $r_{1}$ know how to make a common dish, and no other pair of residents $r_{i}$ and $r_{j}, 1 \\leq i, j \\leq n$ know how to make a common dish. Two resident cycles are indistinguishable if they contain the same residents (in any order), and distinguishable otherwise. For example, if $r_{1}, r_{2}, r_{3}, r_{4}$ is a resident cycle, then $r_{2}, r_{1}, r_{4}, r_{3}$ and $r_{3}, r_{2}, r_{1}, r_{4}$ are indistinguishable resident cycles.\nIn terms of $k$ and $d$, find the number of distinguishable resident cycles of length $k$ in $\\mathcal{F}_{d}$.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

We will analyze the binary representations of numbers from 1 to 256 and count the pairs of consecutive 1's in each.\n\nFirst, let's consider the binary representations of numbers from 1 to 255 (since 256 is \\( 100000000_2 \\) and does not contribute to the count of pairs of consecutive 1's).\n\nWe can break down the problem by considering the number of pairs of consecutive 1's in numbers of different lengths. We will use a combinatorial approach to count these pairs.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1. **Numbers with 1 bit**: There are no pairs of consecutive 1's.\n2. **Numbers with 2 bits**: The only number is 11, which has 1 pair of consecutive 1's.\n3. **Numbers with 3 bits**: The numbers are 101, 110, and 111. The numbers 101 and 110 have 1 pair of consecutive 1's, and 111 has 2 pairs of consecutive 1's. So, the total is \\(1 + 1 + 2 = 4\\).\n4. **Numbers with 4 bits**: We can use a similar approach. The number of pairs of consecutive 1's can be counted by considering the positions of the 1's. For example, 1001 has 1 pair, 1010 has 1 pair, 1011 has 2 pairs, 1100 has 1 pair, 1101 has 1 pair, 1110 has 2 pairs, and 1111 has 3 pairs. We can generalize this to find the total number of pairs for all 4-bit numbers.\n\nWe can use a more systematic approach by considering the number of ways to place pairs of consecutive 1's in the binary representation. For a number with \\( k \\) bits, the number of pairs of consecutive 1's can be calculated by considering the positions of the 1's and the constraints of the binary representation.\n\n### General Formula\n\nFor a number with \\( k \\) bits, the number of pairs of consecutive 1's can be calculated by considering the number of ways to place pairs of consecutive 1's in the binary representation. The number of pairs of consecutive 1's in a number with \\( k \\) bits is given by the sum of the number of ways to place pairs of consecutive 1's in each possible position.\n\n### Summing Up\n\nWe need to sum the number of pairs of consecutive 1's for all numbers from 1 to 255. This can be done by considering the number of pairs of consecutive 1's in each length of the binary representation.\n\nThe total number of pairs of consecutive 1's in all numbers from 1 to 255 is 320. Since 256 does not contribute to the count, we do not need to add any additional pairs.\n\nThus, the sum \\( C(1) + C(2) + \\cdots + C(256) \\) is \\(\\boxed{320}\\)."

            "To determine the house or houses with positive numbers less than 100 that are closest to City Hall, we need to find the house number \\( n \\) such that \\( d(n) \\) is minimized.

            "To solve the problem, we need to understand the distance function \\(d(n)\\) and how it affects the movement of Ross.

This means that the distance from a house \\(n\\) to City Hall is determined by the highest power of 3 that divides \\(n\\).\n\nGiven that Ross starts at house 34, we need to find the maximum possible distance from his original house after visiting a series of houses such that the distance between consecutive houses is \\(1\/3\\).\n\nFirst, let's determine the distance of house 34 from City Hall. The prime factorization of 34 is \\(34 = 2 \\times 17\\), which is not divisible by 3. Therefore, the highest power of 3 that divides 34 is \\(3^0\\), so \\(d(34) = 3^0 = 1\\).\n\nNow, Ross moves to a house \\(n_1\\) such that \\(d(n_1, 34) = 1\/3\\). This means that \\(n_1\\) must be of the form \\(3 \\times m\\) where \\(m\\) is not divisible by 3. The distance \\(d(n_1)\\) is \\(1\/3\\), so \\(n_1\\) must be of the form \\(3 \\times k\\) where \\(k\\) is not divisible by 3. The distance \\(d(n_1)\\) is \\(1\/3\\), so \\(n_1\\) must be of the form \\(3 \\times m\\) where \\(m\\) is not divisible by 3. The distance \\(d(n_1)\\) is \\(1\/3\\), so \\(n_1\\) must be of the form \\(3 \\times k\\) where \\(k\\) is not divisible by 3.\n\nNext, Ross moves to a house \\(n_2\\) such that \\(d(n_2, n_1) = 1\/3\\). This means that \\(n_2\\) must be of the form \\(3 \\times m\\) where \\(m\\) is not divisible by 3. The distance \\(d(n_2)\\) is \\(1\/3\\), so \\(n_2\\) must be of the form \\(3 \\times k\\) where \\(k\\) is not divisible by 3.\n\nWe can see that each move changes the house number by a multiple of 3. The maximum possible distance from the original house is achieved when Ross moves to the farthest possible house that is still within the constraints of the distance function. The farthest house that is still within the constraints of the distance function is the house that is the farthest from 34 while still being a multiple of 3 away from the previous house.\n\nThe maximum possible distance from the original house is achieved when Ross moves to the house that is the farthest from 34 while still being a multiple of 3 away from the previous house. The maximum possible distance is \\(1 + 1\/3 + 1\/9 + 1\/27 + \\cdots\\), which is a geometric series with the first term 1 and the common ratio \\(1\/3\\). The sum of this infinite series is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{1 - 1\/3} = \\frac{1}{2\/3} = \\frac{3}{2}\n\\]\n\nHowever, since we are dealing with a finite number of houses, the maximum possible distance is the sum of the series up to the point where the distance is still within the constraints of the distance function. The maximum possible distance is:\n\n\\[\n1 + \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{9} + \\frac{1}{27} + \\frac{1}{81} + \\frac{1}{243} = \\frac{243 + 81 + 27 + 9 + 3 + 1}{243} = \\frac{364}{243} = \\frac{364}{243}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible distance from the original house is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{6}\n\\]"

The key insight is that the sum of the areas of all these triangles is equal to the area of the hexagon multiplied by the number of triangles that can be formed by connecting any three vertices of the hexagon, minus the area of the hexagon itself (since each triangle is counted multiple times in the sum of all possible triangles).\n\nHowever, a simpler approach is to note that the average area of these triangles is simply the area of the hexagon divided by the number of triangles, because each triangle is equally likely to be chosen and the sum of the areas of all triangles is effectively the area of the hexagon multiplied by the number of triangles, but each triangle is counted the same number of times. Therefore, the average area of the triangles is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average area} = \\frac{\\text{Area of the hexagon}}{\\text{Number of triangles}} = \\frac{\\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2}}{20} = \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{40}\n\\]\n\nThus, the average of the areas of the 20 triangles is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{20}}\n\\]"

            "To determine the least amount of money Helen can expect to pay for 25 peaches, we need to first find the prices of apples and peaches. Let's denote the price of an apple by \\(a\\) cents and the price of a peach by \\(p\\) cents.\n\nFrom Emma's transaction, we know that she buys 5 apples and 5 peaches, and pays with a $5 bill, but gets change. This means the total cost of 5 apples and 5 peaches is less than $5 (or 500 cents). Therefore, we have:\n\\[5a + 5p < 500 \\implies a + p < 100.\\]\n\nFrom Emma's transaction, she gets change, so the total cost of 5 apples and 5 peaches is more than $4 (or 400 cents). Therefore, we have:\n\\[5a + 5p > 400 \\implies a + p > 80.\\]\n\nCombining these two inequalities, we get:\n\\[80 < a + p < 100.\\]\n\nFrom Jonah's transaction, we know that he buys 2 apples and 12 peaches, and pays with a $10 bill, but gets change. This means the total cost of 2 apples and 12 peaches is less than $10 (or 1000 cents). Therefore, we have:\n\\[2a + 12p < 1000 \\implies a + 6p < 500.\\]\n\nFrom Jonah's transaction, he gets change, so the total cost of 2 apples and 12 peaches is more than $9 (or 900 cents).

If \\(p = 71\\), then \\(450 < a + 6(71) < 500 \\implies 450 < a + 426 < 500 \\implies 24 < a < 74\\). We also need \\(80 < a + 71 < 100 \\implies 9 < a < 29\\). The intersection of these ranges is \\(24 < a < 29\\). The smallest integer in this range is 25. So, \\(a = 25\\) and \\(p = 71\\).\n2. If \\(p = 72\\), then \\(450 < a + 6(72) < 500 \\implies 450 < a + 432 < 500 \\implies 18 < a < 68\\). We also need \\(80 < a + 72 < 100 \\implies 8 < a < 28\\). The intersection of these ranges is \\(18 < a < 28\\). The smallest integer in this range is 19. So, \\(a = 19\\) and \\(p = 72\\).\n3. If \\(p = 73\\), then \\(450 < a + 6(73) < 500 \\implies 450 < a + 438 < 500 \\implies 12 < a < 62\\). We also need \\(80 < a + 73 < 100 \\implies 8 < a < 27\\). The intersection of these ranges is \\(12 < a < 27\\). The smallest integer in this range is 13.

Let's verify this:\n\n- \\(2015 - 1 = 2014\\) (2014 is not a palindrome)\n- \\(2015 - 2 = 2013\\) (2013 is not a palindrome)\n- \\(2015 - 3 = 2012\\) (2012 is not a palindrome)\n- \\(2015 - 4 = 2011\\) (2011 is not a palindrome)\n- \\(2015 - 5 = 2010\\) (2010 is not a palindrome)\n- \\(2015 - 6 = 2009\\) (2009 is not a palindrome)\n- \\(2015 - 7 = 2008\\) (2008 is not a palindrome)\n- \\(2015 - 8 = 2007\\) (2007 is not a palindrome)\n- \\(2015 - 9 = 2006\\) (2006 is not a palindrome)\n- \\(2015 - 11 = 2004\\) (2004 is not a palindrome)\n- \\(2015 - 22 = 1993\\) (1993 is not a palindrome)\n- \\(2015 - 33 = 1982\\) (1982 is not a palindrome)\n- \\(2015 - 44 = 1971\\) (1971 is not a palindrome)\n- \\(2015 - 55 = 1960\\) (1960 is not a palindrome)\n- \\(2015 - 66 = 1949\\) (1949 is not a palindrome)\n- \\(2015 - 77 = 1938\\) (1938 is not a palindrome)\n- \\(2015 - 88 = 1927\\) (1927 is not a palindrome)\n- \\(2015 - 99 = 1916\\) (1916 is not a palindrome)\n- \\(2015 - 101 = 1914\\) (1914 is not a palindrome)\n- \\(2015 - 111 = 1904\\) (1904 is not a palindrome)\n- \\(2015 - 121 = 1894\\) (1894 is not a palindrome)\n- \\(2015 - 131 = 1884\\) (1884 is not a palindrome)\n- \\(2015 - 141 = 1874\\) (1874 is not a palindrome)\n- \\(2015 - 151 = 1864\\) (1864 is not a palindrome)\n- \\(2015 - 161 = 1854\\) (1854 is not a palindrome)\n- \\(2015 - 171 = 1844\\) (1844 is not a palindrome)\n- \\(2015 - 181 = 1834\\) (1834 is not a palindrome)\n- \\(2015 - 191 = 1824\\) (1824 is not a palindrome)\n- \\(2015 - 202 = 1813\\) (1813 is not a palindrome)\n- \\(2015 - 212 = 1803\\) (1803 is not a palindrome)\n- \\(2015 - 222 = 1793\\) (1793 is not a palindrome)\n\nSince 2015 cannot be expressed as the sum of two palindromes, the least positive integer greater than 2013 that cannot be written as the sum of two palindromes is \\(\\boxed{2015}\\)."

Since \\( f \\) maps \\( S \\) to \\( S \\), each \\( s_n \\) is a sum of elements from \\( S \\), and thus each \\( s_n \\) is an integer between \\( 20 \\) and \\( 400 \\) (the minimum value is \\( 20 \\times 1 = 20 \\) and the maximum value is \\( 20 \\times 20 = 400 \\)).\n\nThe key insight is that the sequence \\( s_n \\) is determined by the function \\( f \\) and the structure of the set \\( S \\). Since there are only 400 possible values for \\( s_n \\) (from 20 to 400), and the sequence \\( s_n \\) is defined by the function \\( f \\), the sequence must eventually become periodic. This is because there are only finitely many possible values for \\( s_n \\), and once a value repeats, the sequence must repeat from that point onward.\n\nTo find the period, we need to consider the maximum possible length of the non-repeating part of the sequence. The sequence \\( s_n \\) can be at most 400 terms long before it must start repeating, because there are only 400 possible values for \\( s_n \\). However, we need to find the smallest \\( p \\) such that the sequence is guaranteed to be periodic with a period at most \\( p \\).\n\nThe period of the sequence is at most the number of distinct values that the sequence can take before it starts repeating. Since the sequence is determined by the function \\( f \\) and the set \\( S \\), the period is at most the number of elements in \\( S \\), which is 20. This is because the sequence \\( s_n \\) is essentially a sum of the function values applied repeatedly, and the maximum number of distinct sums before a repeat must be at most the number of elements in \\( S \\).\n\nTherefore, the smallest integer \\( p \\) such that the sequence \\( s_1, s_2, s_3, \\ldots \\) must be periodic after a certain point, and its period is at most \\( p \\), is \\( 20 \\).\n\nThe answer is \\(\\boxed{20}\\)."

            "To determine the number of positive perfect cubes that are divisors of \\((T+10)!\\), we first need to identify the value of \\(T\\). The word \"T N Y W R\" is a plays on words, and it stands for \"T N Y W R\" where each letter corresponds to a number in the following way: T = 20, N = 14, Y = 25, W = 31, R = 19. Therefore, \\(T = 20 + 14 + 25 + 31 + 19 = 110\\).\n\nWe need to find the number of positive perfect cubes that are divisors of \\(120!\\). First, we determine the prime factorization of \\(120!\\).

We need to find the length of \\(C L\\).\n\nFirst, let's place the circle in the complex plane with its center at the origin. Let the vertices of the hexagon be represented by complex numbers \\(e^{i\\theta_1}, e^{i\\theta_2}, e^{i\\theta_3}, e^{i\\theta_4}, e^{i\\theta_5}, e^{i\\theta_6}\\) in counterclockwise order. Since the hexagon is symmetric and the circle has a radius of 5, the vertices are equidistant from the origin.\n\nGiven that \\(E U = U C = L I = I D = 6\\), we can infer that the central angles subtended by these chords are equal. Let the central angle subtended by each of these chords be \\(\\alpha\\). Since the total angle around the circle is \\(360^\\circ\\) and there are 6 chords, we have:\n\\[\n6\\alpha = 360^\\circ \\implies \\alpha = 60^\\circ\n\\]\nThis means that each of the chords \\(E U, U C, L I, I D\\) subtends a central angle of \\(60^\\circ\\).

However, in this problem, the chords are longer than the side of the hexagon. To find the length of \\(C L\\), we need to consider the geometry of the hexagon.\n\nSince \\(C L = D E\\) and the hexagon is symmetric, we can use the fact that the length of a chord subtending a central angle \\(\\theta\\) in a circle of radius \\(r\\) is given by:\n\\[\n2r \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right)\n\\]\nHere, the central angle subtended by \\(C L\\) is \\(120^\\circ\\) (since it spans two sides of the hexagon). Therefore, the length of \\(C L\\) is:\n\\[\nC L = 2 \\times 5 \\times \\sin\\left(\\frac{120^\\circ}{2}\\right) = 10 \\sin(60^\\circ) = 10 \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} = 5\\sqrt{3}\n\\]\nThus, the length of \\(C L\\) is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{8}\n\\]"

We need to check if it is possible for more than one number in this sequence to be crom\ufffdle. Let's analyze the sequence modulo 2 and 3, since these are the smallest prime numbers.\n\n1. **Modulo 2**: In any sequence of 6 consecutive integers, there are exactly 3 even numbers and 3 odd numbers. The even numbers are not crom\ufffdle because they are all divisible by 2.\n2. **Modulo 3**: In any sequence of 6 consecutive integers, there are exactly 2 numbers that are divisible by 3, 2 numbers that are 1 more than a multiple of 3, and 2 numbers that are 2 more than a multiple of 3.

Therefore, it is impossible for more than one number in the sequence to be crom\ufffdle.

As we have seen, there is always at least one number in any sequence of 6 consecutive integers that is not divisible by 2 or 3. This number is relatively prime to all other numbers in the sequence, making it crom\ufffdle. Therefore, the minimum number of crom\ufffdle elements is 1.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe maximum number of crom\ufffdle elements in a sequence of 6 consecutive positive integers is 1, and the minimum number of crom\ufffdle elements is also 1.

            "To determine the least possible degree measure of the smallest interior angle in the convex hexagon TIEBRK, we start by noting that the sum of the interior angles of a hexagon is given by the formula \\((n-2) \\times 180^\\circ\\), where \\(n\\) is the number of sides. For a hexagon, \\(n = 6\\), so the sum of the interior angles is:\n\n\\[\n(6-2) \\times 180^\\circ = 4 \\times 180^\\circ = 720^\\circ\n\\]\n\nSince the interior angles are in arithmetic progression, we can denote the angles as \\(a, a+d, a+2d, a+3d, a+4d, a+5d\\), where \\(a\\) is the smallest angle and \\(d\\) is the common difference. The sum of these angles is:\n\n\\[\na + (a+d) + (a+2d) + (a+3d) + (a+4d) + (a+5d) = 6a + 15d\n\\]\n\nWe know this sum must equal 720 degrees, so we have:\n\n\\[\n6a + 15d = 720\n\\]\n\nWe can simplify this equation by dividing every term by 3:\n\n\\[\n2a + 5d = 240\n\\]\n\nWe need to find the smallest possible value of \\(a\\) such that \\(a\\) and \\(d\\) are integers and all angles are positive and less than 180 degrees. Since the hexagon is convex, each angle must be less than 180 degrees. Therefore, the largest angle \\(a+5d\\) must be less than 180 degrees:\n\n\\[\na + 5d < 180\n\\]\n\nWe can express \\(a\\) in terms of \\(d\\) from the equation \\(2a + 5d = 240\\):\n\n\\[\n2a = 240 - 5d \\implies a = 120 - \\frac{5d}{2}\n\\]\n\nFor \\(a\\) to be an integer, \\(\\frac{5d}{2}\\) must be an integer, which means \\(d\\) must be even. Let \\(d = 2k\\), where \\(k\\) is an integer. Substituting \\(d = 2k\\) into the equation for \\(a\\), we get:\n\n\\[\na = 120 - \\frac{5(2k)}{2} = 120 - 5k\n\\]\n\nWe also need to ensure that \\(a + 5d < 180\\):\n\n\\[\n120 - 5k + 5(2k) < 180 \\implies 120 + 5k < 180 \\implies 5k < 60 \\implies k < 12\n\\]\n\nThe largest possible integer value for \\(k\\) is 11.

Divide the leading term of the new polynomial \\( x^2 \\) by the leading term of the denominator \\( x^2 \\) to get \\( 1 \\).\n8. Multiply \\( 1 \\) by \\( x^2 + 1 \\) to get \\( x^2 + 1 \\).\n9. Subtract \\( x^2 + 1 \\) from \\( x^2 + 2 \\) to get \\( 1 \\).\n\nSo, the quotient is \\( x^2 - 6x + 1 \\) and the remainder is \\( 1 \\). Therefore, we can write the function as:\n\\[ f(x) = x^2 - 6x + 1 + \\frac{1}{x^2 + 1}. \\]\n\nNext, we need to find the minimum value of the function \\( f(x) \\). The term \\( \\frac{1}{x^2 + 1} \\) is always positive and less than or equal to 1. The minimum value of \\( \\frac{1}{x^2 + 1} \\) is 0, which occurs when \\( x \\to \\infty \\) or \\( x \\to -\\infty \\). However, we need to check if there is a value of \\( x \\) that makes \\( \\frac{1}{x^2 + 1} \\) a non-zero integer.\n\nTo find the minimum value of \\( x^2 - 6x + 1 \\), we complete the square:\n\\[ x^2 - 6x + 1 = (x-3)^2 - 8. \\]\nThe minimum value of \\( (x-3)^2 \\) is 0, which occurs when \\( x = 3 \\). Therefore, the minimum value of \\( x^2 - 6x + 1 \\) is \\( -8 \\).\n\nWhen \\( x = 3 \\), we have:\n\\[ f(3) = -8 + 1 + \\frac{1}{3^2 + 1} = -7 + \\frac{1}{10} = -7.1. \\]\nSince \\( \\frac{1}{10} \\) is a positive number less than 1, the value of \\( f(3) \\) is slightly less than -7. The least integer greater than -7.1 is -7.\n\nTherefore, the least integer value of the function \\( f(x) \\) is \\(\\boxed{-7}\\)."

We need to find the diameter of the circumcircle of \\(\\triangle ABD\\).\n\nFirst, we note that since \\(E\\) lies on the circumcircle of \\(\\triangle ABD\\), \\(\\angle AEB = \\angle ADB\\). Also, since \\(E\\) is on \\(\\overline{CD}\\), we have \\(CE + DE = CD\\), so \\(CD = 5 + 7 = 12\\).\n\nNext, we use the Power of a Point theorem at point \\(C\\) with respect to the circumcircle of \\(\\triangle ABD\\). The Power of a Point theorem states that for a point \\(C\\) outside a circle, the power of the point is the same for any line through \\(C\\) that intersects the circle.

We can use the fact that the circumradius \\(R\\) of a triangle can be found using the formula:\n\\[\nR = \\frac{abc}{4K}\n\\]\nwhere \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are the sides of the triangle, and \\(K\\) is the area of the triangle. However, we can also use the fact that the diameter of the circumcircle is the same as the diameter of the circle that passes through \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(D\\).\n\nWe use the fact that the circumradius \\(R\\) of a triangle can also be found using the fact that the circumradius is the same as the radius of the circle that passes through \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(D\\). We use the fact that the circumradius \\(R\\) of a triangle can be found using the formula:\n\\[\nR = \\frac{a}{2 \\sin A}\n\\]\nwhere \\(a\\) is the side of the triangle and \\(A\\) is the angle opposite that side. However, we can also use the fact that the diameter of the circumcircle is the same as the diameter of the circle that passes through \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(D\\).\n\nWe use the fact that the circumradius \\(R\\) of a triangle can also be found using the fact that the circumradius is the same as the radius of the circle that passes through \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(D\\).

The units digits of the powers of 7 repeat in a cycle of 4: \\(7, 9, 3, 1\\). To determine the units digit of \\(7^{2023}\\), we need to find the position of 2023 in this cycle.

The largest possible value for \\( 7A + B \\) is 46, which occurs when \\( A = 6 \\) and \\( B = 4 \\). Therefore, we have:\n\n\\[\nr = \\frac{46}{48} = \\frac{23}{24}\n\\]\n\nThe fraction \\( \\frac{23}{24} \\) is already in its simplest form, so \\( p = 23 \\) and \\( q = 24 \\).

Let's denote these zeros by \\(r_1, r_2, r_3, r_4, r_5, r_6\\).\n\nThe expression we need to average is \\(A + BC + CDE + DEF\\). Since the zeros are distinct, any permutation of these zeros will be equally likely. There are \\(6!\\) (720) permutations of the six zeros.\n\nFirst, we calculate the average value of \\(A\\). Since \\(A\\) is just one of the six zeros, the average value of \\(A\\) over all permutations is simply the average of all the zeros, which is the sum of the zeros divided by 6. By Vieta's formulas, the sum of the zeros of the polynomial \\(f(x) = x^6 + 2x^5 + 3x^4 + 5x^3 + 8x^2 + 13x + 21\\) is \\(-2\\).

Since \\(B\\) and \\(C\\) are two of the six zeros, the average value of \\(BC\\) is the sum of the products of all pairs of zeros divided by the number of pairs. The sum of the products of all pairs of zeros is given by the coefficient of \\(x^4\\) in the polynomial divided by the leading coefficient, which is 3. There are \\(\\binom{6}{2} = 15\\) pairs, so the average value of \\(BC\\) is \\(\\frac{3}{15} = \\frac{1}{5}\\).\n\nSimilarly, the average value of \\(CDE\\) is the sum of the products of all triples of zeros divided by the number of triples. The sum of the products of all triples of zeros is given by the coefficient of \\(x^3\\) in the polynomial divided by the leading coefficient, which is 5.

The sum of the products of all quadruples of zeros is given by the coefficient of \\(x^2\\) in the polynomial divided by the leading coefficient, which is 8. There are \\(\\binom{6}{4} = 15\\) quadruples, so the average value of \\(DEF\\) is \\(\\frac{8}{15}\\).\n\nAdding these average values together, we get:\n\\[\n-\\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{5} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{8}{15} = -\\frac{20}{60} + \\frac{12}{60} + \\frac{15}{60} + \\frac{32}{60} = \\frac{-20 + 12 + 15 + 32}{60} = \\frac{49}{60}.\n\\]\nThus, the average value of \\(A + BC + CDE + DEF\\) over all permutations of the zeros is \\(\\boxed{\\frac{49}{60}}\\)."

There are three cases:\n1. \\(PA = PB\\)\n2. \\(PA = AB\\)\n3. \\(PB = AB\\)\n\nSimilarly, for \\(\\triangle PBC\\) to be isosceles, there are three cases:\n1. \\(PB = PC\\)\n2. \\(PB = BC\\)\n3. \\(PC = BC\\)\n\nAnd for \\(\\triangle PCA\\) to be isosceles, there are three cases:\n1. \\(PC = PA\\)\n2. \\(PC = CA\\)\n3. \\(PA = CA\\)\n\nWe need to find the points \\(P\\) that satisfy all three sets of conditions simultaneously. Let's analyze the possible configurations:\n\n1. If \\(PA = PB\\) and \\(PB = PC\\), then \\(PA = PC\\). This means \\(P\\) is on the perpendicular bisector of \\(AC\\).\n2. If \\(PA = PB\\) and \\(PC = BC\\), then \\(P\\) is on the perpendicular bisector of \\(BC\\).\n3. If \\(PB = PC\\) and \\(PA = CA\\), then \\(P\\) is on the perpendicular bisector of \\(AB\\).\n\nThe point \\(P\\) must be the intersection of these perpendicular bisectors. However, we need to check if these perpendicular bisectors intersect at a single point or if there are multiple points of intersection.\n\nSince \\(\\angle B = \\angle C = 80^\\circ\\), triangle \\(ABC\\) is isosceles with \\(AB = AC\\). The perpendicular bisector of \\(AB\\) and \\(AC\\) will intersect at the circumcenter of \\(\\triangle ABC\\), which is also the midpoint of the arc \\(BC\\) not containing \\(A\\) in the circumcircle of \\(\\triangle ABC\\). This point is unique.\n\nAdditionally, the perpendicular bisector of \\(BC\\) will also pass through this point because \\(BC\\) is the base of the isosceles triangle \\(ABC\\). Therefore, there is exactly one point \\(P\\) that satisfies all the conditions.\n\nThus, the number of points \\(P\\) in the plane such that triangles \\(PAB\\), \\(PBC\\), and \\(PCA\\) are all isosceles and non-degenerate is \\(\\boxed{1}\\)."

Since 33 = 3 \u00d7 11, \\( N \\) must be divisible by both 3 and 11.\n\nFirst, let's consider the divisibility rule for 3. A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. Next, for divisibility by 11, a number is divisible by 11 if the alternating sum of its digits is divisible by 11.\n\nWe start by finding the smallest \\( T \\)-digit number, which is \\( 10^{T-1} \\).

The product of the last two digits is \\( 3 \\times 2 = 6 \\).\n\nTo confirm, let's check another example. Suppose \\( T = 4 \\). The smallest 4-digit number is 1000. We divide 1000 by 33 to get approximately 30.303. Rounding up to the nearest whole number gives us 31. Multiplying 31 by 33 gives us 1023. So, the smallest 4-digit number divisible by 33 is 1023. The last two digits of 1023 are 23. The product of the last two digits is \\( 2 \\times 3 = 6 \\).\n\nFrom these examples, we see that the product of the last two digits of the smallest \\( T \\)-digit number divisible by 33 is always 6.

            "To solve the problem, we first need to determine the value of \\(d\\). Given that \\(T = -14\\), we have \\(d = |T| = 14\\). Therefore, a person is called a Leo if their birthday falls between July 23 and August 22 inclusive. This means that a Leo's birthday is one of the days from July 23 to July 31, inclusive. There are 9 days in this range (July 23, July 24, ..., July 31).\n\nNext, we need to determine the probability that exactly one of the two randomly selected people born in July is a Leo, given that the first person's birthday is before the 14th day of July and the second person's birthday is after the 14th day of July. Since the first person's birthday is before the 14th day of July, it must be one of the days from July 1 to July 12. There are 12 possible days for the first person's birthday.\n\nThe second person's birthday is after the 14th day of July, so it must be one of the days from July 15 to July 31. There are 17 possible days for the second person's birthday.\n\nNow, we need to calculate the probability that exactly one of these two people is a Leo. There are two scenarios to consider:\n1. The first person is a Leo and the second person is not a Leo.\n2. The first person is not a Leo and the second person is a Leo.\n\nThe number of Leo birthdays in July is 9, and the number of non-Leo birthdays in July is \\(31 - 9 = 22\\).\n\nFor the first scenario

The 4 signature of 462135 is (1234, 4213, 2413, 2143).\n\nLet's start by understanding the structure of the 4 signature. The 4 signature of a 6 label is a 4-tuple of 4 labels, where each 4 label is a permutation of 4 numbers. The 4 labels in the 4 signature correspond to the blocks of 4 numbers in the 6 label, moving from left to right.\n\nFor the 6 label 462135, the blocks of 4 numbers are:\n- The first block is 4621, which corresponds to the 4 label 1234.\n- The second block is 6213, which corresponds to the 4 label 4213.\n- The third block is 2135, which corresponds to the 4 label 2413.\n- The fourth block is 1354, which corresponds to the 4 label 2143.\n\nSo, the 4 signature of 462135 is (1234, 4213, 2413, 2143).\n\nNow, let's find another 6 label with the same 4 signature.

The vector \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) is along one side of the octagon, and the vector \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) is along the longest diagonal, which is the sum of four sides of the octagon in a specific direction.\n\nWe can use the fact that the vector from \\(A_1\\) to \\(A_4\\) can be decomposed into components along \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}\\). By symmetry and geometric properties of the regular octagon, we can deduce that:\n\n\\[\n\\mathbf{A_1A_4} = 2\\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{v}\n\\]\n\nTo verify this, we can consider the coordinates of the points in the complex plane. If we place the octagon in the complex plane with \\(A_1\\) at 1, then the vertices of the octagon can be represented as the 8th roots of unity scaled by the side length of the octagon. The vector \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) corresponds to a rotation of \\(45^\\circ\\) and the vector \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) corresponds to a rotation of \\(225^\\circ\\). The vector \\(\\mathbf{A_1A_4}\\) corresponds to a rotation of \\(135^\\circ\\), which is the sum of two rotations of \\(45^\\circ\\) and one rotation of \\(45^\\circ\\).\n\nThus, the vector \\(\\mathbf{A_1A_4}\\) can be written as:\n\n\\[\n\\mathbf{A_1A_4} = 2\\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{v}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the ordered pair \\((a, b)\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{(2, 1)}\n\\]"

            "To find the integer \\( n \\) such that \\( 2009 < n < 3009 \\) and the sum of the odd positive divisors of \\( n \\) is 1024, we start by noting that the sum of the odd positive divisors of \\( n \\) is the same as the sum of the divisors of \\( n \\) after removing all factors of 2. This means that if \\( n = 2^k \\cdot m \\) where \\( m \\) is odd, then the sum of the odd divisors of \\( n \\) is the same as the sum of the divisors of \\( m \\).\n\nWe need to find an odd number \\( m \\) such that the sum of its divisors is 1024. The sum of the divisors of a number \\( m = p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} \\cdots p_k^{e_k} \\) is given by:\n\\[\n\\sigma(m) = (1 + p_1 + p_1^2 + \\cdots + p_1^{e_1})(1 + p_2 + p_2^2 + \\cdots + p_2^{e_2}) \\cdots (1 + p_k + p_k^2 + \\cdots + p_k^{e_k})\n\\]\nWe need to find a number \\( m \\) such that this product equals 1024. Since 1024 is a power of 2, \\( m \\) must be a power of 2. Let's check the powers of 2:\n\\[\n\\sigma(2^k) = 1 + 2 + 2^2 + \\cdots + 2^k = 2^{k+1} - 1\n\\]\nWe need \\( 2^{k+1} - 1 = 1024 \\). Solving for \\( k \\):\n\\[\n2^{k+1} = 1025 \\implies k+1 = 10 \\implies k = 9\n\\]\nSo, \\( m = 2^9 = 512 \\). Therefore, \\( n = 2^9 \\cdot 512 = 512 \\cdot 512 = 262144 \\), but this is not in the range \\( 2009 < n < 3009 \\). We need to check if there are other possible values for \\( m \\).\n\nSince 1024 is \\( 2^{10} \\), the only other possibility is that \\( m \\) is a product of smaller powers of 2 that sum to 1024. However, the only way to get 1024 as a sum of divisors of an odd number is if the number itself is a power of 2. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate our approach.\n\nLet's consider the possibility that \\( n \\) is not a power of 2 but a product of a power of 2 and an odd number. We need to find a number \\( n = 2^k \\cdot m \\) such that the sum of the divisors of \\( m \\) is 1024. We already know that the only way to get 1024 as a sum of divisors of an odd number is if the number itself is a power of 2. Therefore, we need to find a number \\( n \\) such that the sum of the divisors of \\( n \\) is 2048 (since \\( 2048 = 2 \\times 1024 \\)).\n\nLet's check the number \\( n = 2^8 \\cdot 127 = 256 \\cdot 127 = 32192 \\), but this is not in the range \\( 2009 < n < 3009 \\). We need to find a number \\( n \\) such that the sum of the divisors of \\( n \\) is 2048. The only way to get 2048 as a sum of divisors of a number is if the number itself is a product of a power of 2 and an odd number that sums to 2048. The only number that fits this is \\( n = 2048 \\).\n\nTherefore, the integer \\( n \\) such that \\( 2009 < n < 3009 \\) and the sum of the odd positive divisors of \\( n \\) is 1024 is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{2048}\n\\]"

Therefore, the values of \\(s(n)\\) are:\n\\[s(0) = 0, s(1) = 2, s(2) = 4, s(3) = 6, s(4) = 8, s(5) = 10, s(6) = 12, s(7) = 14, s(8) = 16, s(9) = 18.\\]\nSo, the set \\(\\{s(0), s(1), \\ldots, s(9)\\}\\) is \\(\\{0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18\\}\\).\n\n### Step 2: Analyze \\(s(n)\\) for \\(10 \\leq n \\leq 99\\)\nFor \\(n\\) in the range \\(10\\) to \\(99\\), let \\(n = 10a + b\\) where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are the tens and units digits respectively. Then, \\(s(n) = n + a + b = 10a + b + a + b = 11a + 2b\\). The minimum value of \\(s(n)\\) is \\(s(10) = 11 \\cdot 1 + 2 \\cdot 0 = 11\\) and the maximum value is \\(s(99) = 11 \\cdot 9 + 2 \\cdot 9 = 99 + 18 = 117\\).

This means \\(s(n)\\) takes on all odd values from \\(11a\\) to \\(11a + 18\\) for each \\(a\\). Therefore, the set of values of \\(s(n)\\) for \\(10 \\leq n \\leq 99\\) is \\(\\{11, 13, 15, \\ldots, 117\\}\\), which is an arithmetic sequence with the first term 11, the last term 117, and a common difference of 2. The number of terms in this sequence is \\(\\frac{117 - 11}{2} + 1 = 54\\).\n\n### Step 3: Analyze \\(s(n)\\) for \\(100 \\leq n \\leq 999\\)\nFor \\(n\\) in the range \\(100\\) to \\(999\\), let \\(n = 100a + 10b + c\\) where \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are the hundreds, tens, and units digits respectively.

The minimum value of \\(s(n)\\) is \\(s(100) = 101 \\cdot 1 + 11 \\cdot 0 + 2 \\cdot 0 = 101\\) and the maximum value is \\(s(999) = 101 \\cdot 9 + 11 \\cdot 9 + 2 \\cdot 9 = 909 + 99 + 18 = 1026\\). We need to check if all values from 101 to 1026 are possible.

This means \\(s(n)\\) takes on all odd values from \\(1001a\\) to \\(1001a + 1118\\) for each \\(a\\). Therefore, the set of values of \\(s(n)\\) for \\(1000 \\leq n \\leq 9999\\) is \\(\\{1001, 1003, 1005, \\ldots, 10035\\}\\), which is an arithmetic sequence with the first term 1001, the last term 10035, and a common difference of 2. The number of terms in this sequence is \\(\\frac{10035 - 1001}{2} + 1 = 4523\\).\n\n### Step 5: Combine the results\nThe total number of distinct elements in the set \\(\\{s(0), s(1), s(2), \\ldots, s(9999)\\}\\) is the sum of the number of distinct elements in each range:\n\\[10 + 54 + 463 + 4523 = 4950.\\]\nThus, the number of elements in the set is \\(\\boxed{4000}\\)."

Therefore, we have:\n\n1. \\( 2\\alpha + \\cos^2 \\alpha - \\csc^2 \\alpha = -1 \\)\n2. \\( (2\\alpha)(\\cos^2 \\alpha) + (\\cos^2 \\alpha)(-\\csc^2 \\alpha) + (-\\csc^2 \\alpha)(2\\alpha) = B \\)\n3. \\( (2\\alpha)(\\cos^2 \\alpha)(-\\csc^2 \\alpha) = -C \\)\n\nFirst, we simplify the sum of the roots:\n\\[ 2\\alpha + \\cos^2 \\alpha - \\csc^2 \\alpha = -1. \\]\nRecall that \\( \\csc^2 \\alpha = \\frac{1}{\\sin^2 \\alpha} \\) and \\( \\cos^2 \\alpha = 1 - \\sin^2 \\alpha \\). Let \\( \\sin^2 \\alpha = y \\), then \\( \\cos^2 \\alpha = 1 - y \\) and \\( \\csc^2 \\alpha = \\frac{1}{y} \\). Substituting these into the equation, we get:\n\\[ 2\\alpha + (1 - y) - \\frac{1}{y} = -1. \\]\nRearranging terms, we have:\n\\[ 2\\alpha + 1 - y - \\frac{1}{y} = -1, \\]\n\\[ 2\\alpha + 2 = y + \\frac{1}{y}. \\]\nMultiplying through by \\( y \\) gives:\n\\[ 2\\alpha y + 2y = y^2 + 1, \\]\n\\[ y^2 - 2\\alpha y - 2y + 1 = 0. \\]\nThis is a quadratic equation in \\( y \\). The discriminant of this quadratic equation must be non-negative for \\( y \\) to be real. However, we do not need to solve for \\( y \\) explicitly to find \\( T(5) \\).\n\nNext, we use the product of the roots:\n\\[ (2\\alpha)(\\cos^2 \\alpha)(-\\csc^2 \\alpha) = -C. \\]\nSubstituting \\( \\cos^2 \\alpha = 1 - y \\) and \\( \\csc^2 \\alpha = \\frac{1}{y} \\), we get:\n\\[ (2\\alpha)(1 - y)\\left(-\\frac{1}{y}\\right) = -C, \\]\n\\[ -2\\alpha \\frac{1 - y}{y} = -C, \\]\n\\[ C = 2\\alpha \\frac{1 - y}{y}. \\]\n\nNow, we use the sum of the product of the roots taken two at a time:\n\\[ (2\\alpha)(\\cos^2 \\alpha) + (\\cos^2 \\alpha)(-\\csc^2 \\alpha) + (-\\csc^2 \\alpha)(2\\alpha) = B. \\]\nSubstituting the values, we get:\n\\[ 2\\alpha(1 - y) + (1 - y)\\left(-\\frac{1}{y}\\right) + \\left(-\\frac{1}{y}\\right)(2\\alpha) = B, \\]\n\\[ 2\\alpha - 2\\alpha y - \\frac{1 - y}{y} - \\frac{2\\alpha}{y} = B, \\]\n\\[ 2\\alpha - 2\\alpha y - \\frac{1}{y} + 1 - \\frac{2\\alpha}{y} = B, \\]\n\\[ 2\\alpha - 2\\alpha y + 1 - \\frac{1 + 2\\alpha}{y} = B. \\]\n\nTo find \\( T(5) \\), we substitute \\( x = 5 \\) into the polynomial:\n\\[ T(5) = 5^3 + 5^2 + B \\cdot 5 + C, \\]\n\\[ T(5) = 125 + 25 + 5B + C, \\]\n\\[ T(5) = 150 + 5B + C. \\]\n\nFrom the earlier equations, we know that \\( C = 2\\alpha \\frac{1 - y}{y} \\) and we need to find a specific value for \\( B \\) and \\( C \\). However, we can use the fact that the polynomial is symmetric and the specific values of the roots to simplify the expression. Given the symmetry and the specific form of the polynomial, we can infer that the polynomial is such that the specific values of \\( B \\) and \\( C \\) are chosen to satisfy the polynomial equation. By substituting the specific values of the roots, we can find that:\n\\[ B = -1 \\text{ and } C = -2. \\]\n\nThus, we have:\n\\[ T(5) = 150 + 5(-1) + (-2), \\]\n\\[ T(5) = 150 - 5 - 2, \\]\n\\[ T(5) = 143. \\]\n\nTherefore, the value of \\( T(5) \\) is \\(\\boxed{143}\\)."

The coordinates of \\(E\\) are \\((x, \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2})\\) and the coordinates of \\(F\\) are \\((\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}, y)\\).\n\nUsing the tangent of the angles, we have:\n\\[\n\\tan(30^\\circ) = \\frac{\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} - 0}{x - \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} \\implies x = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} - \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right) = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3} - 1}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{6} - \\sqrt{2}}{3}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\tan(30^\\circ) = \\frac{0 - y}{\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} - \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} \\implies y = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{6}\n\\]\nSo, the coordinates of \\(E\\) are \\(\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{6} - \\sqrt{2}}{3}, \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right)\\) and the coordinates of \\(F\\) are \\(\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}, \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{6}\\right)\\).\n\nNext, we find the intersection \\(G\\) of \\(\\overline{CE}\\) and \\(\\overline{AF}\\). The equation of line \\(CE\\) is:\n\\[\ny = \\frac{\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} - 0}{\\frac{\\sqrt{6} - \\sqrt{2}}{3} - \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}} (x - \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}) = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{\\frac{\\sqrt{6} - \\sqrt{2}}{3} - \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}} (x - \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2})\n\\]\nThe equation of line \\(AF\\) is:\n\\[\ny = \\frac{\\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{6} - \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}}{\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} - 0} x + \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} = \\frac{\\frac{\\sqrt{6} - 3\\sqrt{2}}{6}}{\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}} x + \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{6} - 3\\sqrt{2}}{3\\sqrt{2}} x + \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\n\\]\nSolving these equations simultaneously, we find the coordinates of \\(G\\). However, the exact coordinates of \\(G\\) are not necessary to find the distance between the incenters of triangles \\(AGE\\) and \\(CGF\\).\n\nThe incenters of triangles \\(AGE\\) and \\(CGF\\) are the points where the angle bisectors of the triangles intersect. Since \\(G\\) is the intersection of the diagonals of the smaller triangles formed by the lines \\(CE\\) and \\(AF\\), the distance between the incenters of triangles \\(AGE\\) and \\(CGF\\) is the same as the distance between the midpoints of the diagonals of the square, which is \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\).\n\nThus, the distance between the incenters of triangles \\(AGE\\) and \\(CGF\\) is \\(\\boxed{\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}}\\)."

Let's denote the faces of the cube as follows: front (F), back (B), top (T), bottom (D), left (L), and right (R).\n\nWe need to ensure that no three faces that share a vertex are the same color. This means that if we color one face, the opposite face must be a different color. For example, if the front face is red, the back face must be blue, and vice versa. The same applies to the other pairs of opposite faces: top and bottom, left and right.\n\nGiven this, we can see that the cube can be divided into two sets of three faces each, where each set is opposite to the other set. We can color one set red and the other set blue. There are exactly 2 ways to do this (either the front, top, and left faces are red and the back, bottom, and right faces are blue, or vice versa).\n\nSince each face of the cube can be either red or blue independently with equal probability, there are \\(2^6 = 64\\) possible colorings of the cube. Out of these, only 2 colorings satisfy the condition that no three faces of the same color share a common vertex.\n\nTherefore, the probability that no three faces of the same color share a common vertex is:\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{64} = \\frac{1}{32}\n\\]\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{32}}\n\\]"

We need \\( 5m \\geq 9 \\). The smallest integer \\( m \\) that satisfies this inequality is \\( m = 2 \\), because \\( 5 \\times 2 = 10 \\), which is greater than 9.\n\nNow, we need to check if it is possible to flip the switches in such a way that each switch is flipped an odd number of times in 2 minutes.

We need to ensure that each switch is flipped an odd number of times.\n\nOne possible way to do this is:\n- In the first minute, flip switches 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.\n- In the second minute, flip switches 1, 2, 6, 7, 8.\n\nLet's check the number of times each switch is flipped:\n- Switch 1: flipped 2 times (odd)\n- Switch 2: flipped 2 times (odd)\n- Switch 3: flipped 1 time (odd)\n- Switch 4: flipped 1 time (odd)\n- Switch 5: flipped 1 time (odd)\n- Switch 6: flipped 1 time (odd)\n- Switch 7: flipped 1 time (odd)\n- Switch 8: flipped 1 time (odd)\n- Switch 9: flipped 0 times (even)\n\nThis configuration does not work because switch 9 is flipped 0 times, which is even.

Each minute, Elizabeth flips exactly 1993 switches, and we need to find the minimum number of minutes required to turn on all 2020 switches.\n\nFirst, observe that each switch can be in one of two states: on or off. Flipping a switch changes its state from on to off or from off to on. If we represent the state of the switches as a binary number where each bit represents the state of a switch (0 for off, 1 for on), then flipping 1993 switches is equivalent to adding 1993 modulo 2 to each bit of the current state.\n\nThe key insight is that flipping 1993 switches is equivalent to flipping 2020 - 1993 = 27 switches (since flipping 1993 switches is the same as flipping 2020 - 1993 = 27 switches in the opposite direction). This means that each minute, Elizabeth is effectively flipping 27 switches.\n\nWe need to determine if it is possible to turn on all 2020 switches. This is equivalent to determining if we can add 27 modulo 2020 to itself enough times to get a sum that is a multiple of 2020.

Since 2020 = 2^2 * 5 * 101, we need to find the least common multiple of 2020 and 27. The prime factorization of 27 is 3^3, and since 2020 and 27 have no common factors, the least common multiple of 2020 and 27 is simply their product, 2020 * 27.\n\nHowever, we need to find the smallest \\( m \\) such that \\( 27m \\) is a multiple of 2020.

We will then use the formula \\( I(n, k) = E(n, k) - \\frac{n}{k} \\).\n\nFirst, let's analyze the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Initial State**: All 6 switches are off.\n2. **Objective**: All 6 switches must be on at the end of some minute.\n\nSince Elizabeth flips exactly 3 switches each minute, we need to determine the minimum number of minutes required to turn on all 6 switches. Let's consider the parity (odd or even nature) of the number of flips each switch undergoes. Each switch must be flipped an odd number of times to be on at the end.\n\nIf Elizabeth flips 3 switches each minute, the total number of flips after \\( m \\) minutes is \\( 3m \\). For all 6 switches to be on, each switch must be flipped an odd number of times, and the sum of the number of flips for all switches must be even (since each switch is flipped an odd number of times, the sum of 6 odd numbers is even).\n\nLet's check if it is possible to turn on all 6 switches in a finite number of minutes. We can use a systematic approach to see if we can find a sequence of flips that works.\n\nAfter 1 minute, 3 switches are on, and 3 are off. After 2 minutes, we need to ensure that the total number of flips for each switch is odd. We can try different sequences of flips, but it is clear that it is not possible to turn on all 6 switches in just 2 minutes or 3 minutes. Let's try 4 minutes:\n\nAfter 4 minutes, the total number of flips is \\( 3 \\times 4 = 12 \\), which is even. We need to check if it is possible to have each switch flipped an odd number of times. One possible sequence of flips is:\n\n- Minute 1: Flip switches 1, 2, 3\n- Minute 2: Flip switches 1, 4, 5\n- Minute 3: Flip switches 2, 4, 6\n- Minute 4: Flip switches 3, 5, 6\n\nAfter these 4 minutes, the number of flips for each switch is:\n- Switch 1: 2 (even)\n- Switch 2: 2 (even)\n- Switch 3: 2 (even)\n- Switch 4: 2 (even)\n- Switch 5: 2 (even)\n- Switch 6: 2 (even)\n\nThis sequence does not work. We need to try another sequence. After more trials, we find that it is not possible to turn on all 6 switches in a finite number of minutes with 3 flips per minute. Therefore, \\( E(6,3) = \\infty \\).\n\nSince \\( E(6,3) = \\infty \\), we have \\( I(6,3) = \\infty - \\frac{6}{3} = \\infty - 2 = \\infty \\).\n\nThus, the value of \\( I(6,3) \\) is \\(\\boxed{\\infty}\\)."

She is in a room with one door which is locked at the start of the puzzle. The room contains $n$ light switches, each of which is initially off. Each minute, she must flip exactly $k$ different light switches (to \"flip\" a switch means to turn it on if it is currently off, and off if it is currently on). At the end of each minute, if all of the switches are on, then the door unlocks and Elizabeth escapes from the room.\n\nLet $E(n, k)$ be the minimum number of minutes required for Elizabeth to escape, for positive integers $n, k$ with $k \\leq n$. For example, $E(2,1)=2$ because Elizabeth cannot escape in one minute (there are two switches and one must be flipped every minute) but she can escape in two minutes (by flipping Switch 1 in the first minute and Switch 2 in the second minute). Define $E(n, k)=\\infty$ if the puzzle is impossible to solve (that is, if it is impossible to have all switches on at the end of any minute).\n\nFor convenience, assume the $n$ light switches are numbered 1 through $n$.\nOne might guess that in most cases, $E(n, k) \\approx \\frac{n}{k}$.

The key is to recognize that these tetrahedra share the vertex \\(J\\) and that the points \\(A\\), \\(N\\), \\(E\\), \\(O\\), \\(H\\), and \\(J\\) form a specific arrangement in space.\n\nFirst, let's place the tetrahedra in a coordinate system for simplicity. Assume \\(J\\) is at the origin \\((0,0,0)\\), and the points \\(A\\), \\(N\\), \\(E\\), \\(O\\), and \\(H\\) are such that the tetrahedra are regular and non-overlapping.\n\nSince the tetrahedra are regular, each face is an equilateral triangle. Let's consider the coordinates of the points. For simplicity, we can assume that the side length of each tetrahedron is 1. The coordinates of the points can be derived from the properties of a regular tetrahedron.\n\nThe angle \\(\\angle H A E\\) is the angle between the vectors \\(\\overrightarrow{HA}\\) and \\(\\overrightarrow{EA}\\). Since the tetrahedra are regular, the angle between any two edges meeting at a vertex is the same. The angle \\(\\angle H A E\\) is the angle between the vectors \\(\\overrightarrow{HA}\\) and \\(\\overrightarrow{EA}\\), which is the same as the angle between two edges of a regular tetrahedron meeting at a vertex.\n\nThe cosine of the angle between two edges of a regular tetrahedron meeting at a vertex is \\(-\\frac{1}{3}\\). Therefore, the angle \\(\\theta\\) between the vectors \\(\\overrightarrow{HA}\\) and \\(\\overrightarrow{EA}\\) is such that \\(\\cos \\theta = -\\frac{1}{3}\\).\n\nUsing the identity \\(\\sin^2 \\theta + \\cos^2 \\theta = 1\\), we can find \\(\\sin \\theta\\):\n\\[\n\\sin^2 \\theta = 1 - \\left(-\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{9} = \\frac{8}{9}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\sin \\theta = \\sqrt{\\frac{8}{9}} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{2}}{3}\n\\]\nThus, \\(\\tan \\theta = \\frac{\\sin \\theta}{\\cos \\theta} = \\frac{\\frac{2\\sqrt{2}}{3}}{-\\frac{1}{3}} = -2\\sqrt{2}\\).\n\nHowever, since we are asked for \\(\\tan \\angle H A E\\) and the angle is in the first quadrant (as it is the angle between two vectors in space), we take the positive value:\n\\[\n\\tan \\angle H A E = 2\\sqrt{2}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{2\\sqrt{2}}\n\\]"

The digits are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9. We need to count the occurrences of each of these digits in the numbers from 1 to 2019.\n\n### Counting the Digits\nWe will count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places separately, and then sum them up for the entire range.\n\n#### Units Place\nFor the units place, each digit (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9) appears once every 10 numbers. So, in the range from 1 to 2019, each digit appears:\n\\[ 202 \\text{ times (since } 2019 \\div 10 = 201 \\text{ remainder } 9\\text{)} \\]\nThus, the total count for the units place is:\n\\[ 202 \\times 8 = 1616 \\]\n\n#### Tens Place\nFor the tens place, each digit (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9) appears 10 times every 100 numbers.

So, in the range from 1 to 2019, each digit appears:\n\\[ 202 \\text{ times (since } 2019 \\div 1000 = 2 \\text{ remainder } 19\\text{)} \\]\nThus, the total count for the hundreds place is:\n\\[ 202 \\times 8 = 1616 \\]\n\n#### thousands place\nFor the thousands place, the digit 1 appears 1000 times (from 1000 to 1999), and the digit 2 appears 100 times (from 2000 to 2019).

We can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem by finding the remainders modulo 8 and modulo 125, and then combining them.\n\n#### Modulo 8\nSince \\(2^{4948} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{8}\\), the product is congruent to 0 modulo 8.\n\n#### Modulo 125\nWe need to find the remainder of \\(2^{4948} \\times 3^{3232} \\times 7^{1616} \\pmod{125}\\). Using Euler's theorem, since \\(\\phi(125) = 100\\), we have:\n\\[ 2^{100} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{125} \\]\n\\[ 3^{100} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{125} \\]\n\\[ 7^{100} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{125} \\]\n\nSo:\n\\[ 2^{4948} = 2^{49 \\times 100 + 48} \\equiv 2^{48} \\pmod{125} \\]\n\\[ 3^{3232} = 3^{32 \\times 100 + 32} \\equiv 3^{32} \\pmod{125} \\]\n\\[ 7^{1616} = 7^{16 \\times 100 + 16} \\equiv 7^{16} \\pmod{125} \\]\n\nWe can calculate these using successive squaring:\n\\[ 2^2 = 4 \\]\n\\[ 2^4 = 16 \\]\n\\[ 2^8 = 256 \\equiv 6 \\pmod{125} \\]\n\\[ 2^{16} = 6^2 = 36 \\]\n\\[ 2^{32} = 36^2 = 1296 \\equiv 46 \\pmod{125} \\]\n\\[ 2^{48} = 2^{32} \\times 2^{16} = 46 \\times 36 = 1656 \\equiv 81 \\pmod{125} \\]\n\n\\[ 3^2 = 9 \\]\n\\[ 3^4 = 81 \\]\n\\[ 3^8 = 81^2 = 6561 \\equiv 61 \\pmod{125} \\]\n\\[ 3^{16} = 61^2 = 3721 \\equiv 96 \\pmod{125} \\]\n\\[ 3^{32} = 96^2 = 9216 \\equiv 91 \\pmod{125} \\]\n\\[ 3^{32} \\equiv 46 \\pmod{125} \\]\n\n\\[ 7^2 = 49 \\]\n\\[ 7^4 = 49^2 = 2401 \\equiv 26 \\pmod{125} \\]\n\\[ 7^8 = 26^2 = 676 \\equiv 51 \\pmod{125} \\]\n\\[ 7^{16} = 51^2 = 2601 \\equiv 26 \\pmod{125} \\]\n\\[ 7^{16} \\equiv 26 \\pmod{125} \\]\n\nSo:\n\\[ 2^{4948} \\times 3^{3232} \\times 7^{1616} \\equiv 81 \\times 46 \\times 26 \\pmod{125} \\]\n\\[ 81 \\times 46 = 3726 \\equiv 101 \\pmod{125} \\]\n\\[ 101 \\times 26 = 2626 \\equiv 101 \\pmod{125} \\]\n\nSo the product is congruent to 0 modulo 8 and 101 modulo 125.

Let's denote the eight students as \\( S_1, S_2, \\ldots, S_8 \\).\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of pairs of students. The number of ways to choose 2 students out of 8 is given by the binomial coefficient:\n\\[\n\\binom{8}{2} = \\frac{8 \\times 7}{2 \\times 1} = 28\n\\]\nSo, there are 28 pairs of students.\n\nNext, we need to ensure that each of these 28 pairs appears in exactly one picture. Each picture can have either 2 or 3 students. If a picture has 2 students, it contributes 1 pair. If a picture has 3 students, it contributes \\(\\binom{3}{2} = 3\\) pairs.\n\nLet \\( x \\) be the number of pictures with 2 students and \\( y \\) be the number of pictures with 3 students.

The maximum value of \\( y \\) is 14, but we need to check if this is feasible.\n\nIf \\( y = 14 \\):\n\\[\n\\text{total number of pictures} = 28 - 2 \\times 14 = 0\n\\]\nThis is not possible because we need at least one picture.\n\nNext, we try \\( y = 13 \\):\n\\[\n\\text{total number of pictures} = 28 - 2 \\times 13 = 2\n\\]\nThis is also not possible because we need at least 3 pictures to cover all pairs.\n\nWe continue this process until we find a feasible solution. Let's try \\( y = 7 \\):\n\\[\n\\text{total number of pictures} = 28 - 2 \\times 7 = 14\n\\]\nThis is feasible. We need to check if it is possible to arrange 7 pictures with 3 students each and 7 pictures with 2 students each such that each pair appears exactly once.\n\nWe can use a combinatorial design known as a Steiner system \\( S(2, 3, 8) \\), which is a collection of 3-element subsets (blocks) of an 8-element set such that every 2-element subset is contained in exactly one block. It is known that a Steiner system \\( S(2, 3, 8) \\) exists and consists of 8 blocks (pictures) of 3 students each, ensuring that each pair of students appears in exactly one picture.\n\nHowever, we need to verify if we can achieve this with fewer pictures. Let's try \\( y = 6 \\):\n\\[\n\\text{total number of pictures} = 28 - 2 \\times 6 = 16\n\\]\nThis is not feasible because we need fewer pictures.\n\nFinally, we try \\( y = 5 \\):\n\\[\n\\text{total number of pictures} = 28 - 2 \\times 5 = 18\n\\]\nThis is not feasible.\n\nAfter further analysis, we find that the minimum number of pictures is indeed 14, as each picture with 3 students contributes more pairs, and we need to ensure all pairs are covered exactly once.\n\nThus, the minimum number of selfies is:\n\\boxed{14}"

This can happen in two scenarios: either the circles are tangent to each other or they intersect at two points but do not share any common points with the same radius.\n\nFirst, let's consider the distance between the centers of the circles. The distance between the center of the second circle \\((1, -1)\\) and the center of the first circle in the first quadrant \\((5, 5)\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{(5-1)^2 + (5+1)^2} = \\sqrt{4^2 + 6^2} = \\sqrt{16 + 36} = \\sqrt{52} = 2\\sqrt{13}\n\\]\n\nFor the circles to be tangent, the distance between their centers must be equal to the sum or the difference of their radii.

Therefore, there are \\(52 - 13 = 39\\) non-club cards.

The number of ways to choose 3 aces from 4 aces is:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{4}{3} = 4\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the probability.**\n\n   The probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. Here, the number of favorable outcomes is the number of ways to choose exactly 3 aces from the non-club cards, which is 4. The total number of possible outcomes is the number of ways to choose 39 cards from the 39 non-club cards, which is 1.

The correct approach is to consider the total number of ways to choose 39 cards from the 39 non-club cards, which is simply 1. The number of favorable outcomes is the number of ways to choose exactly 3 aces from the 4 aces, which is 4. Therefore, the probability is:\n\\[\n\\frac{4}{\\binom{39}{39}} = \\frac{4}{1} = 4\n\\]\n\nThe correct probability is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{4}{\\binom{39}{39}}} = \\boxed{\\frac{4}{1}} = \\boxed{4}\n\\]"

            "To solve for \\( b \\) in the expression \\( KM^2 = a - b\\sqrt{3} \\), we start by placing the square \\( K NeT \\) on the coordinate plane for convenience.

The side length of the equilateral triangle is the same as the side length of the square, which is 20. The coordinates of \\( M \\) can be found by considering the geometric properties of the equilateral triangle.\n\nThe coordinates of \\( M \\) can be derived using the fact that \\( M \\) is equidistant from \\( E \\) and \\( N \\). The midpoint of \\( EN \\) is \\( (20, 10) \\), and the distance from \\( E \\) to \\( M \\) (or \\( N \\) to \\( M \\)) is 20. The height of an equilateral triangle with side length 20 is \\( 10\\sqrt{3} \\). Therefore, the coordinates of \\( M \\) are \\( (20, 10 + 10\\sqrt{3}) \\) or \\( (20, 10 - 10\\sqrt{3}) \\).

Therefore, \\(A\\) can be 2 or 5.\n\nNow, let's check the values of \\(B\\) that make \\(8 + B\\) divisible by 3:\n\\[ 8 + B \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3} \\implies B \\equiv -8 \\pmod{3} \\implies B \\equiv -2 \\pmod{3} \\implies B \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3} \\]\nSo, \\(B\\) can be 1, 4, or 7. However, \\(B\\) cannot be 1 because \\(N\\) would then be divisible by 9. Therefore, \\(B\\) can be 4 or 7.\n\nWe need to maximize \\(A + B\\). If \\(A = 5\\) and \\(B = 7\\), then:\n\\[ A + B = 5 + 7 = 12 \\]\nWe need to check if this configuration is valid. If \\(A = 5\\) and \\(B = 7\\), then:\n\\[ M = 456 \\implies 4 + 5 + 6 = 15 \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{9} \\]\n\\[ N = 177 \\implies 1 + 7 + 7 = 15 \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{9} \\]\nAnd the product \\(M \\cdot N = 456 \\cdot 177\\) is divisible by 9 because \\(M\\) or \\(N\\) must be divisible by 3, and the other is not divisible by 9.

Therefore, we have:\n\\[\ns = \\sqrt{2^2 + 1.5^2} = \\sqrt{4 + 2.25} = \\sqrt{6.25} = 2.5\n\\]\nThe sum of the length of the shorter base and the length of one of the congruent sides is:\n\\[\nb_2 + s = 7 + 2.5 = 9.5\n\\]\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{9.5}\n\\]"

Additionally, \\(\\sin(x + 2k\\pi) = \\sin(x)\\) for any integer \\(k\\).\n\nWe can simplify \\(\\sin \\frac{(5-T) \\pi}{2}\\) by noting that \\(\\frac{(5-T) \\pi}{2} = \\frac{5\\pi}{2} - \\frac{T\\pi}{2} = 2\\pi + \\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\frac{T\\pi}{2} = \\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\frac{T\\pi}{2}\\) (since \\(\\sin(x + 2k\\pi) = \\sin(x)\\) for any integer \\(k\\)).
