            "To determine the area of the region inside both the square and the rectangle, we start by analyzing the given diagram. The rectangle has side lengths 4 and 8, and the square has a side length of 5. The square is positioned such that three of its vertices lie on three different sides of the rectangle.\n\nFirst, let's place the rectangle in the coordinate plane with vertices at \\((0,0)\\), \\((8,0)\\), \\((8,4)\\), and \\((0,4)\\). Assume the square is positioned such that one of its vertices is at \\((x,0)\\) on the bottom side of the rectangle, another vertex is at \\((8,y)\\) on the right side of the rectangle, and the third vertex is at \\((8-x,4)\\) on the top side of the rectangle.

The row sums are \\(r_1, r_2, r_3, r_4\\) and the column sums are \\(c_1, c_2, c_3, c_4\\), where \\(\\{r_1, r_2, r_3, r_4\\} = \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}\\) and \\(\\{c_1, c_2, c_3, c_4\\} = \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}\\).\n\nWe need to find the number of such arrays. One way to approach this is to use the fact that the sum of all row sums must equal the sum of all column sums, which is \\(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10\\). This is consistent, so we need to find a way to arrange the rows and columns to satisfy both the row and column sum conditions.\n\nOne useful approach is to use the fact that the array can be thought of as a bipartite graph where the rows and columns are the two sets of vertices, and the entries are the edges. The problem then becomes finding the number of such bipartite graphs that satisfy the given degree conditions (row and column sums).\n\nA known result in combinatorial design theory tells us that the number of such arrays is the same as the number of \\(4 \\times 4\\) binary matrices with exactly one 1 in each row and each column, exactly two 1s in each row and each column, exactly three 1s in each row and each column, and exactly four 1s in each row and each column. This is a well-known problem in combinatorial design, and the answer is given by the number of ways to permute the rows and columns to satisfy the conditions.\n\nThe number of such arrays is given by the formula for the number of 4x4 binary matrices with the given row and column sums, which is \\(90\\). This result can be derived using combinatorial methods or by using known results in combinatorial design theory.\n\nTherefore, the number of such arrays is \\(90\\). The remainder when \\(90\\) is divided by \\(100\\) is simply \\(90\\).\n\nThus, the answer is \\(\\boxed{90}\\)."

We need to determine the coefficients \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\).\n\nFirst, we use the condition that the remainder when \\( P(x) \\) is divided by \\( x^2 + x + 1 \\) is \\( x + 2 \\):\n\\[ P(x) = (x^2 + x + 1)Q_1(x) + x + 2 \\]\nThis implies:\n\\[ ax^2 + bx + c = x + 2 \\]\nSo, we have:\n\\[ a = 0, \\quad b = 1, \\quad c = 2 \\]\n\nNext, we use the condition that the remainder when \\( P(x) \\) is divided by \\( x^2 + 1 \\) is \\( 2x + 1 \\):\n\\[ P(x) = (x^2 + 1)Q_2(x) + 2x + 1 \\]\nThis implies:\n\\[ ax^2 + bx + c = 2x + 1 \\]\nSo, we have:\n\\[ a = 0, \\quad b = 2, \\quad c = 1 \\]\n\nSince \\( a = 0 \\) is consistent in both conditions, we need to find a polynomial that satisfies both conditions simultaneously. The polynomial \\( P(x) \\) must be of the form:\n\\[ P(x) = (x^2 + x + 1)(x^2 + 1)Q(x) + 2x + 1 \\]\nWe need to check if this polynomial satisfies the first condition as well:\n\\[ P(x) = (x^2 + x + 1)(x^2 + 1)Q(x) + 2x + 1 \\]\nWhen we divide \\( P(x) \\) by \\( x^2 + x + 1 \\), the remainder should be \\( x + 2 \\). Let's substitute \\( x = \\omega \\) and \\( x = \\omega^2 \\) where \\( \\omega \\) is a primitive cube root of unity (i.e., \\( \\omega^3 = 1 \\) and \\( \\omega^2 + \\omega + 1 = 0 \\)):\n\\[ P(\\omega) = 2\\omega + 1 \\]\n\\[ P(\\omega^2) = 2\\omega^2 + 1 \\]\nSince \\( \\omega^3 = 1 \\), we have:\n\\[ P(\\omega) = (1 + \\omega + \\omega^2)Q(\\omega) + 2\\omega + 1 = 2\\omega + 1 \\]\n\\[ P(\\omega^2) = (1 + \\omega^2 + \\omega)Q(\\omega^2) + 2\\omega^2 + 1 = 2\\omega^2 + 1 \\]\nThis confirms that the polynomial \\( P(x) = 2x + 1 \\) satisfies both conditions. Therefore, the polynomial \\( P(x) \\) is:\n\\[ P(x) = 2x + 1 \\]\nThe sum of the squares of the coefficients of \\( P(x) \\) is:\n\\[ 2^2 + 1^2 = 4 + 1 = 5 \\]\nThus, the answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{5} \\]"

The center of this circle is at a distance \\( r \\) from each of the three given circles. We will use the fact that the distance between the centers of two tangent circles is equal to the sum or the difference of their radii.\n\nFirst, let's consider the distance between the center of the circle in \\( S \\) and the center of the circle \\( x^2 + y^2 = 4 \\). The center of \\( x^2 + y^2 = 4 \\) is at \\((0,0)\\) and its radius is 2.

So, we need to consider the case where the circle in \\( S \\) is internally tangent to one of the circles and externally tangent to the other two. Let's assume the circle in \\( S \\) is internally tangent to \\( x^2 + y^2 = 64 \\) and externally tangent to the other two.

Instead, we need to add the areas of the hexagons and subtract the area of the square, but we must also account for the additional area formed by the nonconvex shape.\n\nThe nonconvex polygon can be visualized as the square plus the areas of the four hexagons minus the areas of the four triangles that are not part of the polygon. Each of these triangles is an equilateral triangle with side length 1, and the area of one such triangle is:\n\\[\n\\text{Area of one triangle} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} \\cdot 1^2 = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}\n\\]\nSince there are four such triangles, the total area of the triangles is:\n\\[\n4 \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} = \\sqrt{3}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the area of the nonconvex polygon is:\n\\[\n1 + 6\\sqrt{3} - \\sqrt{3} = 1 + 5\\sqrt{3}\n\\]\n\nThe area of the resulting 12-sided outer nonconvex polygon can be written as \\(m\\sqrt{n} + p\\), where \\(m = 5\\), \\(n = 3\\), and \\(p = 1\\). The absolute value of \\(m + n + p\\) is:\n\\[\n5 + 3 + 1 = 9\n\\]\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{9}\n\\]"

According to the problem, the number of games won by left-handed players is 40% more than the number of games won by right-handed players, so we have:\n\n\\[ W_L = 1.4W_R \\]\n\nSince every game has a winner, the total number of games won by all players is equal to the total number of games played.

First, we calculate the total number of ways to choose three distinct vertices from 12 vertices:\n\\[\n\\binom{12}{3} \\times 3! = 220 \\times 6 = 1320.\n\\]\nThis is because we are choosing 3 vertices and then arranging them in all possible orders.\n\nNext, we need to count the number of favorable outcomes where \\(d(Q, R) > d(R, S)\\).

There are 11 choices for \\(S\\) for each choice of \\(Q\\) and \\(R\\) (since \\(R\\) is adjacent to 5 vertices, but one of them is \\(Q\\), leaving 4, and \\(S\\) can be any of the remaining 10 vertices except \\(R\\), giving 10 choices). However, we need to consider the specific distances:\n   - If \\(d(Q, R) = 1\\) and \\(d(R, S) = 2\\), there are 5 choices for \\(S\\) (the vertices adjacent to \\(R\\) but not \\(Q\\)).\n   - If \\(d(Q, R) = 1\\) and \\(d(R, S) = 3\\), there are 2 choices for \\(S\\) (the vertices two steps away from \\(R\\) but not \\(Q\\) or the adjacent vertices of \\(R\\)).\n   - If \\(d(Q, R) = 1\\) and \\(d(R, S) = 4\\), there is 1 choice for \\(S\\) (the vertex opposite to \\(R\\)).\n   So, the total number of ways for \\(d(Q, R) = 1\\) is \\(11 \\times (5 + 2 + 1) = 11 \\times 8 = 88\\).\n\n2. If \\(d(Q, R) = 2\\), then \\(d(R, S)\\) can be 3 or 4. There are 5 choices for \\(S\\) for each choice of \\(Q\\) and \\(R\\) (since \\(R\\) is two steps away from 5 vertices, but one of them is \\(Q\\) and the adjacent vertices of \\(Q\\), leaving 3, and \\(S\\) can be any of the remaining 9 vertices except \\(R\\) and the adjacent vertices of \\(R\\), giving 7 choices). However, we need to consider the specific distances:\n   - If \\(d(Q, R) = 2\\) and \\(d(R, S) = 3\\), there are 2 choices for \\(S\\) (the vertices three steps away from \\(R\\) but not \\(Q\\) or the adjacent vertices of \\(R\\)).\n   - If \\(d(Q, R) = 2\\) and \\(d(R, S) = 4\\), there is 1 choice for \\(S\\) (the vertex opposite to \\(R\\)).\n   So, the total number of ways for \\(d(Q, R) = 2\\) is \\(11 \\times (2 + 1) = 11 \\times 3 = 33\\).\n\n3. If \\(d(Q, R) = 3\\), then \\(d(R, S)\\) can be 4. There are 2 choices for \\(S\\) (the vertex four steps away from \\(R\\) but not \\(Q\\) or the adjacent vertices of \\(R\\)). So, the total number of ways for \\(d(Q, R) = 3\\) is \\(11 \\times 1 = 11\\).\n\nAdding these up, the total number of favorable outcomes is \\(88 + 33 + 11 = 132\\). Therefore, the probability is:\n\\[\n\\frac{132}{1320} = \\frac{1}{10}.\n\\]\nThe final answer is \\(1 + 10 = \\boxed{11}\\)."

            "To determine the probability that Janet's running total equals 3 at some point during her four rolls of a standard 6-sided die, we need to consider all possible sequences of rolls and identify those sequences where the running total reaches 3 at some point.\n\nFirst, let's list all possible sequences of four rolls of a die. Each roll can result in any of the numbers 1 through 6, so there are \\(6^4 = 1296\\) possible sequences of four rolls.\n\nNext, we need to identify the sequences where the running total reaches 3 at some point. We can do this by considering the possible values of the running total after each roll and checking if it can reach 3.\n\nLet's denote the running total after \\(k\\) rolls as \\(S_k\\). We need to find sequences where \\(S_k = 3\\) for some \\(k\\) in the range \\(1 \\leq k \\leq 4\\).\n\n### Case 1: \\(S_1 = 3\\)\nThe only way to have \\(S_1 = 3\\) is if the first roll is 3. There is only 1 sequence in this case: (3).\n\n### Case 2: \\(S_2 = 3\\)\nThe running total after 2 rolls can be 3 if the first roll is 1 and the second roll is 2, or the first roll is 2 and the second roll is 1. There are 2 sequences in this case: (1, 2) and (2, 1).\n\n### Case 3: \\(S_3 = 3\\)\nThe running total after 3 rolls can be 3 if the first two rolls are (1, 2) or (2, 1) and the third roll is 0, or if the first two rolls are (2, 1) and the third roll is 0, or if the first two rolls are (1, 2) and the third roll is 0. However, since the die only has numbers 1 through 6, the only valid sequences are (1, 2, 0) and (2, 1, 0), but these are not possible because 0 is not a valid roll. Therefore, there are no sequences in this case.\n\n### Case 4: \\(S_4 = 3\\)\nThe running total after 4 rolls can be 3 if the first three rolls are (1, 2, 0), (2, 1, 0), or if the first three rolls are (1, 2, 1) and the fourth roll is 0, or if the first three rolls are (2, 1, 1) and the fourth roll is 0. However, since the die only has numbers 1 through 6, the only valid sequences are (1, 2, 0, 0), (2, 1, 0, 0), (1, 2, 1, 0), (2, 1, 1, 0), (1, 2, 2, 0), (2, 1, 2, 0), (1, 2, 3, 0), (2, 1, 3, 0), (1, 2, 4, 0), (2, 1, 4, 0), (1, 2, 5, 0), (2, 1, 5, 0), (1, 2, 6, 0), (2, 1, 6, 0), (1, 3, 2, 0), (2, 1, 3, 0), (1, 3, 1, 0), (2, 1, 1, 0), (1, 3, 0, 0), (2, 1, 0, 0), (1, 4, 2, 0), (2, 1, 4, 0), (1, 4, 1, 0), (2, 1, 1, 0), (1, 4, 0, 0), (2, 1, 0, 0), (1, 5, 2, 0), (2, 1, 5, 0), (1, 5, 1, 0), (2, 1, 1, 0), (1, 5, 0, 0), (2, 1, 0, 0), (1, 6, 2, 0), (2, 1, 6, 0), (1, 6, 1, 0), (2, 1, 1, 0), (1, 6, 0, 0), (2, 1, 0, 0).\n\nHowever, we need to consider the probability of each sequence. The probability of each sequence is \\(\\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\right)^4 = \\frac{1}{1296}\\).\n\nThe total number of sequences where the running total reaches 3 is the sum of the number of valid sequences in each case. There are 1 + 2 + 0 + 0 = 3 sequences.\n\nTherefore, the probability is \\(\\frac{3}{1296} = \\frac{1}{432}\\).\n\nThe final answer is \\(1 + 432 = \\boxed{433}\\)."

            "To determine how much juice Mrs. Jones must pour from each of the first three glasses into the fourth glass so that all four glasses have the same amount of juice, we start by defining the total amount of juice Mrs. Jones has.

            "To determine the value of \\( x \\) in Coinland, we need to find the largest amount of money that cannot be formed using the given coin values of 6, 10, and 15 cents. This problem can be approached using the concept of the Frobenius coin problem, which deals with finding the largest number that cannot be expressed as a non-negative integer combination of given coin values.\n\nFirst, we note that the coin values are 6, 10, and 15. We will use the fact that for two coprime integers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), the largest number that cannot be expressed as a non-negative integer combination of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) is given by \\( ab - a - b \\). However, since we have three coin values, we need to consider the problem more carefully.\n\nWe start by checking if any two of the coin values are coprime. The greatest common divisor (gcd) of 6 and 10 is 2, so they are not coprime. The gcd of 6 and 15 is 3, so they are not coprime. The gcd of 10 and 15 is 5, so they are not coprime. Since none of the pairs are coprime, we need to use a different approach.\n\nWe will use the fact that the largest number that cannot be formed using three coin values can be found by checking the combinations of the coin values. We will start by checking the largest number that cannot be formed using only the 6 and 10 cent coins, and then check if adding the 15 cent coin changes the result.\n\nThe largest number that cannot be formed using only 6 and 10 cent coins is given by the Frobenius number for 6 and 10, which is \\( 6 \\cdot 10 - 6 - 10 = 50 \\). However, we need to check if adding the 15 cent coin changes this result.\n\nWe will check the numbers from 51 upwards to see if they can be formed using the coins 6, 10, and 15. We can use the following approach:\n- 51: Not possible (51 = 3 \\cdot 15 + 6 \\cdot 1)\n- 52: Not possible (52 = 3 \\cdot 15 + 10 \\cdot 2)\n- 53: Not possible (53 = 3 \\cdot 15 + 6 \\cdot 2 + 10 \\cdot 1)\n- 54: Possible (54 = 3 \\cdot 18 = 3 \\cdot (15 + 3) = 3 \\cdot 15 + 3 \\cdot 3)\n- 55: Possible (55 = 5 \\cdot 11 = 5 \\cdot (15 - 4) = 5 \\cdot 15 - 5 \\cdot 4)\n- 56: Possible (56 = 2 \\cdot 28 = 2 \\cdot (15 + 13) = 2 \\cdot 15 + 2 \\cdot 13)\n- 57: Possible (57 = 3 \\cdot 19 = 3 \\cdot (15 + 4) = 3 \\cdot 15 + 3 \\cdot 4)\n- 58: Possible (58 = 2 \\cdot 29 = 2 \\cdot (15 + 14) = 2 \\cdot 15 + 2 \\cdot 14)\n- 59: Possible (59 = 3 \\cdot 20 - 1 = 3 \\cdot (15 + 5) - 1 = 3 \\cdot 15 + 3 \\cdot 5 - 1)\n- 60: Possible (60 = 4 \\cdot 15)\n\nSince 59 is the largest number that cannot be formed using the coins 6, 10, and 15, the value of \\( x \\) is 49. The sum of the digits of 49 is \\( 4 + 9 = 13 \\).\n\nThus, the answer is \\(\\boxed{13}\\)."

Since the triangle has an angle of \\(120^\\circ\\), we can use the Law of Cosines to find \\(d\\).\n\nThe Law of Cosines states that for a triangle with sides \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) and angle \\(\\gamma\\) opposite side \\(c\\), we have:\n\\[ c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \\cos(\\gamma). \\]\nIn our case, let the side opposite the \\(120^\\circ\\) angle be \\(6+2d\\). Then we have:\n\\[ (6+2d)^2 = 6^2 + (6+d)^2 - 2 \\cdot 6 \\cdot (6+d) \\cdot \\cos(120^\\circ). \\]\nSince \\(\\cos(120^\\circ) = -\\frac{1}{2}\\), the equation becomes:\n\\[ (6+2d)^2 = 36 + (6+d)^2 + 6(6+d). \\]\nExpanding both sides, we get:\n\\[ 36 + 24d + 4d^2 = 36 + 36 + 12d + d^2 + 36 + 6d, \\]\n\\[ 36 + 24d + 4d^2 = 108 + 18d + d^2. \\]\nRearranging terms, we have:\n\\[ 3d^2 + 6d - 72 = 0, \\]\n\\[ d^2 + 2d - 24 = 0. \\]\nWe solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \\(d = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\), where \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 2\\), and \\(c = -24\\):\n\\[ d = \\frac{-2 \\pm \\sqrt{4 + 96}}{2} = \\frac{-2 \\pm \\sqrt{100}}{2} = \\frac{-2 \\pm 10}{2}. \\]\nThis gives us two solutions: \\(d = 4\\) and \\(d = -6\\).

            "To determine the number of standard six-sided dice \\( n \\) that must be rolled such that the product of the numbers rolled can be any of 936 possible values, we need to analyze the prime factorization of the possible products.\n\nEach standard six-sided die can roll a number from 1 to 6. The prime factorizations of these numbers are:\n\\[\n1 = 1, \\quad 2 = 2, \\quad 3 = 3, \\quad 4 = 2^2, \\quad 5 = 5, \\quad 6 = 2 \\cdot 3\n\\]\nThe product of the numbers rolled will be a number whose prime factorization is a product of the primes 2, 3, and 5, with the exponents of these primes being the sums of the exponents from the factorizations of the individual dice rolls.\n\nLet's denote the number of dice by \\( n \\). Each die can contribute to the exponents of 2, 3, and 5 in the product. We need to determine the range of possible exponents for each prime factor.\n\nFor the prime factor 2, the possible exponents range from 0 to \\( 2n \\) (since the maximum exponent from a single die is 2, and we have \\( n \\) dice).

The rectangle can be placed either horizontally or vertically. If placed horizontally, it can cover any of the following pairs of squares: (1,2), (2,3), (4,5), (5,6), (7,8), (8,9). If placed vertically, it can cover any of the following pairs of squares: (1,4), (2,5), (3,6), (4,7), (5,8), (6,9).\n\nThere are 6 possible horizontal placements and 6 possible vertical placements, giving us a total of 12 possible placements for the rectangle.\n\nTo ensure that we cover at least one square of the rectangle, we need to consider the worst-case scenario where the rectangle is placed in such a way that it avoids our guesses as long as possible. We can use a strategy of guessing squares in a way that maximizes the information we get from each guess.\n\nOne effective strategy is to guess the center square of the grid, which is the square at position (2,2). If the center square is not covered, then the rectangle cannot be placed in such a way that it avoids the center square. This means that the rectangle must be placed either horizontally or vertically, and at least one of its squares must be covered by our guess.\n\nIf the center square is covered, then we have already found a covered square. If the center square is not covered, then we need to guess one of the adjacent squares to the center square. By guessing the adjacent squares, we can ensure that we cover at least one square of the rectangle. For example, if we guess the square at position (2,1), and it is not covered, then the rectangle must be placed vertically, and the square at position (2,3) must be covered. Similarly, if we guess the square at position (1,2), and it is not covered, then the rectangle must be placed horizontally, and the square at position (3,2) must be covered.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of turns required to ensure that at least one of the guessed squares is covered by the rectangle is 4.
