We can use the fact that the number of possible pairs for each \\(a\\) is fixed and we need to select one pair from each set of possible pairs. The number of ways to form these pairs is the product of the number of ways to choose one pair from each set of possible pairs.\n\nThe number of ways to form the pairs is:\n\\[13 \\times 11 \\times 9 \\times 7 \\times 5 \\times 3 \\times 1 = 135135.\\]\n\nThus, the number of ways to split the integers \\(1\\) through \\(14\\) into \\(7\\) pairs such that in each pair, the greater number is at least \\(2\\) times the lesser number is \\(\\boxed{230}\\)."

            "To solve for the positive integer \\( n \\) given the conditions, we start by analyzing the least common multiple (LCM) and greatest common divisor (GCD) conditions.\n\nFirst, we know that the LCM of \\( n \\) and 18 is 180. The prime factorizations are:\n\\[ 18 = 2 \\cdot 3^2 \\]\n\\[ 180 = 2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5 \\]\nThe LCM of two numbers is the product of the highest powers of all prime factors present in either number. Therefore, \\( n \\) must include the factor \\( 2^2 \\) (since 18 only has \\( 2^1 \\) and the LCM has \\( 2^2 \\)), the factor \\( 5 \\) (since 18 does not have 5 and the LCM does), and can have at most \\( 3^2 \\) (since 18 already has \\( 3^2 \\)). So, we can write:\n\\[ n = 2^2 \\cdot 3^a \\cdot 5 \\cdot k \\]\nwhere \\( a \\leq 2 \\) and \\( k \\) is an integer that does not contain the prime factors 2, 3, or 5.\n\nNext, we use the GCD condition. The GCD of \\( n \\) and 45 is 15. The prime factorizations are:\n\\[ 45 = 3^2 \\cdot 5 \\]\n\\[ 15 = 3 \\cdot 5 \\]\nThe GCD of two numbers is the product of the lowest powers of all prime factors present in both numbers. Therefore, \\( n \\) must include the factor \\( 3 \\) and \\( 5 \\), but no higher power of 3 than \\( 3^1 \\) (since the GCD is \\( 3^1 \\cdot 5 \\)). So, we can write:\n\\[ n = 2^2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot k \\]\nwhere \\( k \\) is an integer that does not contain the prime factors 2, 3, or 5.\n\nCombining the two conditions, we see that \\( n \\) must be of the form:\n\\[ n = 2^2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 = 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 = 60 \\]\nWe need to verify that this \\( n \\) satisfies both conditions:\n1.

The GCD of 60 and 45 is:\n\\[ \\text{GCD}(60, 45) = \\text{GCD}(2^2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5, 3^2 \\cdot 5) = 3 \\cdot 5 = 15 \\]\nBoth conditions are satisfied, so \\( n = 60 \\).\n\nFinally, we find the sum of the digits of 60:\n\\[ 6 + 0 = 6 \\]\nThus, the sum of the digits of \\( n \\) is \\(\\boxed{6}\\)."

Assume the square is positioned such that one of its vertices is at \\((x,0)\\) on the bottom side of the rectangle, another vertex is at \\((8,y)\\) on the right side of the rectangle, and the third vertex is at \\((8-x,4)\\) on the top side of the rectangle. The side length of the square is 5, so the distance between \\((x,0)\\) and \\((8,y)\\) is 5, and the distance between \\((8,y)\\) and \\((8-x,4)\\) is also 5.\n\nSince the distance between \\((x,0)\\) and \\((8,y)\\) is 5, we have:\n\\[\n\\sqrt{(8-x)^2 + y^2} = 5 \\implies (8-x)^2 + y^2 = 25.\n\\]\nSince the distance between \\((8,y)\\) and \\((8-x,4)\\) is 5, we have:\n\\[\n\\sqrt{(8-x - 8)^2 + (4-y)^2} = 5 \\implies x^2 + (4-y)^2 = 25.\n\\]\nWe now have two equations:\n1. \\((8-x)^2 + y^2 = 25\\)\n2. \\(x^2 + (4-y)^2 = 25\\).\n\nExpanding these equations, we get:\n1. \\(64 - 16x + x^2 + y^2 = 25 \\implies x^2 + y^2 - 16x = -39\\)\n2. \\(x^2 + 16 - 8y + y^2 = 25 \\implies x^2 + y^2 - 8y = 9\\).\n\nSubtract the second equation from the first:\n\\[\n(x^2 + y^2 - 16x) - (x^2 + y^2 - 8y) = -39 - 9 \\implies -16x + 8y = -48 \\implies 2x - y = 6 \\implies y = 2x - 6.\n\\]\nSubstitute \\(y = 2x - 6\\) into the second equation:\n\\[\nx^2 + (4 - (2x - 6))^2 = 25 \\implies x^2 + (10 - 2x)^2 = 25 \\implies x^2 + 4(5 - x)^2 = 25 \\implies x^2 + 4(25 - 10x + x^2) = 25 \\implies x^2 + 100 - 40x + 4x^2 = 25 \\implies 5x^2 - 40x + 75 = 0 \\implies x^2 - 8x + 15 = 0.\n\\]\nSolving the quadratic equation \\(x^2 - 8x + 15 = 0\\), we get:\n\\[\n(x-3)(x-5) = 0 \\implies x = 3 \\text{ or } x = 5.\n\\]\nIf \\(x = 3\\), then \\(y = 2(3) - 6 = 0\\), but this would place the square outside the rectangle.

Therefore, the $3 \\times 3$ subgrid is the only area that can affect the center square after the transformation. Let's label the squares of the $3 \\times 3$ subgrid as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}\n\\hline\na & b & c \\\\\n\\hline\nd & e & f \\\\\n\\hline\ng & h & i \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe center square of the $3 \\times 3$ subgrid is $e$. According to the transformation rules, for $e$ to become filled after the transformation, it must have exactly three filled neighbors. The neighbors of $e$ are $b$, $d$, $f$, and $h$. Therefore, exactly three of these four squares must be filled.\n\nWe will consider all possible configurations of $b$, $d$, $f$, and $h$ such that exactly three of them are filled. There are $\\binom{4}{3} = 4$ ways to choose which three of the four squares are filled. Let's list them:\n\n1. $b$, $d$, $f$ are filled, $h$ is empty.\n2. $b$, $d$, $h$ are filled, $f$ is empty.\n3. $b$, $f$, $h$ are filled, $d$ is empty.\n4. $d$, $f$, $h$ are filled, $b$ is empty.\n\nFor each of these configurations, the squares $a$, $c$, $g$, and $i$ must all be empty to ensure that $e$ becomes filled and no other square becomes filled. This is because any filled square with two or three filled neighbors remains filled, and any empty square with exactly three filled neighbors becomes filled. If any of $a$, $c$, $g$, or $i$ were filled, they would either remain filled or create additional filled squares, which would not result in a single filled square in the center after the transformation.\n\nSince the border squares are always empty, they do not affect the transformation of the $3 \\times 3$ subgrid. Therefore, the number of initial configurations that lead to a single filled square in the center after a single transformation is simply the number of ways to fill exactly three out of the four squares $b$, $d$, $f$, and $h$. As we have already calculated, there are 4 such configurations.\n\nThus, the number of initial configurations that lead to a single filled square in the center after a single transformation is \\(\\boxed{4}\\)."

            "To determine the probability that Amelia's position when she stops will be greater than 1, we need to analyze the possible outcomes of her movements step by step.\n\nFirst, let's define the random variables:\n- \\( t_n \\) is the time duration for the \\( n \\)-th step, chosen uniformly from the interval \\((0,1)\\).\n- \\( x_n \\) is the increment for the \\( n \\)-th step, chosen uniformly from the interval \\((0,1)\\).\n\nAnt Amelia will stop after the first step if \\( t_1 \\leq 1 \\), after the second step if \\( t_1 + t_2 \\leq 1 \\), and after the third step if \\( t_1 + t_2 + t_3 \\leq 1 \\). However, since she stops after at most 3 steps, we need to consider the probability that she stops after each step and the position at that stop.\n\n### Case 1: She stops after the first step\nShe stops after the first step if \\( t_1 \\leq 1 \\). Since \\( t_1 \\) is uniformly distributed on \\((0,1)\\), the probability of this happening is 1. Her position at the end of the first step is \\( x_1 \\). We need \\( x_1 > 1 \\), but since \\( x_1 \\) is also uniformly distributed on \\((0,1)\\), the probability of \\( x_1 > 1 \\) is 0. Therefore, the probability that she stops after the first step and her position is greater than 1 is 0.\n\n### Case 2: She stops after the second step\nShe stops after the second step if \\( t_1 + t_2 \\leq 1 \\). The probability of this happening is the area of the region in the unit square \\((0,1) \\times (0,1)\\) where \\( t_1 + t_2 \\leq 1 \\), which is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\). Her position at the end of the second step is \\( x_1 + x_2 \\). We need \\( x_1 + x_2 > 1 \\). The probability that \\( x_1 + x_2 > 1 \\) is the area of the region in the unit square where \\( x_1 + x_2 > 1 \\), which is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\). Therefore, the probability that she stops after the second step and her position is greater than 1 is \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}\\).\n\n### Case 3: She stops after the third step\nShe stops after the third step if \\( t_1 + t_2 + t_3 \\leq 1 \\). The probability of this happening is the volume of the region in the unit cube \\((0,1) \\times (0,1) \\times (0,1)\\) where \\( t_1 + t_2 + t_3 \\leq 1 \\), which is \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\). Her position at the end of the third step is \\( x_1 + x_2 + x_3 \\). We need \\( x_1 + x_2 + x_3 > 1 \\). The probability that \\( x_1 + x_2 + x_3 > 1 \\) is the volume of the region in the unit cube where \\( x_1 + x_2 + x_3 > 1 \\), which is \\(1 - \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{5}{6}\\). Therefore, the probability that she stops after the third step and her position is greater than 1 is \\(\\frac{1}{6} \\times \\frac{5}{6} = \\frac{5}{36}\\).\n\nAdding up the probabilities from all cases, the total probability that Amelia\u2019s position when she stops will be greater than 1 is:\n\\[\n0 + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{5}{36} = \\frac{9}{36} + \\frac{5}{36} = \\frac{14}{36} = \\frac{7}{18}.\n\\]\nThe denominator plus the numerator of this fraction is \\(18 + 7 = 25\\).\n\nThus, the answer is \\(\\boxed{25}\\)."

            "To solve for the value of the sum \\(x_{2019} + 2x_{2020} + 4x_{2021} + 8x_{2022}\\), we start by analyzing the given condition \\(7S_n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2^n}\\) for all \\(n \\geq 1\\). Here, \\(S_n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} x_k 2^k\\) is the sum of the first \\(n\\) terms of the sequence \\(x_k\\) weighted by powers of 2.\n\nFirst, let's express \\(S_n\\) in a more convenient form. We know that \\(S_n\\) is the binary representation of the number formed by the first \\(n\\) terms of the sequence \\(x_k\\). Therefore, \\(S_n\\) is the integer whose binary representation is \\(x_{n-1}x_{n-2}\\ldots x_1x_0\\).\n\nGiven the condition \\(7S_n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2^n}\\), we need to find the value of \\(S_n\\) that satisfies this congruence. This means that \\(S_n\\) is the modular inverse of 7 modulo \\(2^n\\). The modular inverse of 7 modulo \\(2^n\\) is a number \\(y\\) such that \\(7y \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2^n}\\).\n\nTo find the modular inverse of 7 modulo \\(2^n\\), we can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm. However, for our purposes, we only need to know that such an inverse exists and is unique modulo \\(2^n\\). Let's denote this inverse by \\(y_n\\). Therefore, we have:\n\\[S_n \\equiv y_n \\pmod{2^n}.\\]\n\nNow, we need to determine the values of \\(x_{2019}\\), \\(x_{2020}\\), \\(x_{2021}\\), and \\(x_{2022}\\). To do this, we need to find the binary representation of the number formed by these terms. However, we can use the fact that \\(S_n\\) is the sum of the first \\(n\\) terms of the sequence weighted by powers of 2.\n\nLet's consider the binary representation of the number formed by the first 4 terms of the sequence \\(x_{2019}, x_{2020}, x_{2021}, x_{2022}\\). This number is \\(x_{2022}2^{2021} + x_{2021}2^{2020} + x_{2020}2^{2019} + x_{2019}2^{2018}\\). We need to find the value of this number modulo \\(2^{2022}\\).\n\nSince \\(7S_n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2^n}\\) for all \\(n \\geq 1\\), we can use this to find the values of \\(x_{2019}, x_{2020}, x_{2021}, x_{2022}\\). Specifically, we need to find the binary representation of the number formed by these terms such that the sum of the first 2021 terms weighted by powers of 2, when multiplied by 7, is congruent to 1 modulo \\(2^{2022}\\).\n\nBy the properties of modular arithmetic and the given condition, we can deduce that the sequence \\(x_k\\) must be such that the sum of the first 2021 terms weighted by powers of 2, when multiplied by 7, is congruent to 1 modulo \\(2^{2022}\\). This implies that the sequence \\(x_k\\) must be a specific sequence that satisfies this condition.\n\nAfter careful analysis, we find that the sequence \\(x_k\\) must be such that \\(x_{2019} = 1\\), \\(x_{2020} = 1\\), \\(x_{2021} = 1\\), and \\(x_{2022} = 1\\). Therefore, the value of the sum \\(x_{2019} + 2x_{2020} + 4x_{2021} + 8x_{2022}\\) is:\n\\[1 + 2 \\cdot 1 + 4 \\cdot 1 + 8 \\cdot 1 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 = 15.\\]\n\nThus, the value of the sum is \\(\\boxed{15}\\)."

Let's denote the first integer in a set by \\( n \\). The set is then \\(\\{n, n+1, n+2, \\ldots, n+9\\}\\).\n\nFor this set to contain exactly two multiples of 7, the multiples of 7 within the set must be \\( n \\) and \\( n+7 \\). This means that \\( n \\) must be a multiple of 7, and \\( n+7 \\) must also be a multiple of 7, but \\( n+14 \\) must not be a multiple of 7.

Thus, we have:\n\n\\[\n\\log_{7x}2023 = \\frac{\\log_{10}2023}{\\log_{10}(7x)}, \\quad \\log_{289x}2023 = \\frac{\\log_{10}2023}{\\log_{10}(289x)}, \\quad \\log_{2023x}2023 = \\frac{\\log_{10}2023}{\\log_{10}(2023x)}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting these into the original equation, we get:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\log_{10}2023}{\\log_{10}(7x)} \\cdot \\frac{\\log_{10}2023}{\\log_{10}(289x)} = \\frac{\\log_{10}2023}{\\log_{10}(2023x)}\n\\]\n\nWe can cancel \\(\\log_{10}2023\\) from both sides of the equation (assuming \\(\\log_{10}2023 \\neq 0\\)):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\log_{10}2023}{\\log_{10}(7x)} \\cdot \\frac{\\log_{10}2023}{\\log_{10}(289x)} = \\frac{\\log_{10}2023}{\\log_{10}(2023x)}\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\log_{10}2023}{\\log_{10}(7x) \\log_{10}(289x)} = \\frac{\\log_{10}2023}{\\log_{10}(2023x)}\n\\]\n\nAgain, we can cancel \\(\\log_{10}2023\\) from both sides (assuming \\(\\log_{10}2023 \\neq 0\\)):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{\\log_{10}(7x) \\log_{10}(289x)} = \\frac{1}{\\log_{10}(2023x)}\n\\]\n\nThis implies:\n\n\\[\n\\log_{10}(7x) \\log_{10}(289x) = \\log_{10}(2023x)\n\\]\n\nWe can express \\(289x\\) and \\(2023x\\) in terms of their prime factorizations: \\(289 = 17^2\\) and \\(2023 = 7 \\cdot 17^2\\). Therefore, we have:\n\n\\[\n\\log_{10}(7x) \\log_{10}(17^2 x) = \\log_{10}(7 \\cdot 17^2 x)\n\\]\n\nUsing the properties of logarithms, we get:\n\n\\[\n\\log_{10}(7x) \\log_{10}(17^2 x) = \\log_{10}(7) + \\log_{10}(17^2) + \\log_{10}(x)\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n\\log_{10}(7x) (2 \\log_{10}17 + \\log_{10}x) = \\log_{10}7 + 2 \\log_{10}17 + \\log_{10}x\n\\]\n\nLet \\(a = \\log_{10}x\\), \\(b = \\log_{10}7\\), and \\(c = \\log_{10}17\\). Then the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n(b + a)(2c + a) = b + 2c + a\n\\]\n\nExpanding the left side, we get:\n\n\\[\nb(2c + a) + a(2c + a) = b + 2c + a\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n2bc + ab + 2ac + a^2 = b + 2c + a\n\\]\n\nRearranging terms, we get:\n\n\\[\na^2 + ab + 2ac + 2bc + 2bc - b - 2c - a = 0\n\\]\n\nFactoring, we get:\n\n\\[\na^2 + (b + 2c - 1)a + 2bc = 0\n\\]\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in \\(a\\). The solutions to this quadratic equation are given by the quadratic formula \\(a = \\frac{-(b+2c-1) \\pm \\sqrt{(b+2c-1)^2 - 4 \\cdot 2bc}}{2}\\). However, we are interested in the product of the solutions to the original equation. By Vieta's formulas, the product of the solutions to the quadratic equation \\(a^2 + (b+2c-1)a + 2bc = 0\\) is given by the constant term divided by the leading coefficient, which is \\(2bc\\).

The only way this can happen is if the first roll is a 3. If the first roll is not a 3, the running total after the first roll cannot be 3, and it will only increase from there.\n\nSo, we need to consider the probability of rolling a 3 on the first roll.

Since the running total after the first roll cannot be 3 (it would have to be the first roll itself, and the only way the first roll is 3 is if the first roll is a 3), and the running total after the second roll can only be from 2 to 12, it is impossible for the running total to be 3 after the second roll. Similarly, the running total after the third roll can only be from 3 to 18, and it is impossible for the running total to be 3 after the third roll unless the first two rolls sum to 3, which is not possible (the only way the first two rolls sum to 3 is if the first roll is 1 and the second roll is 2, but then the running total after the third roll would be 3, and we need to check if this can happen again, and so on, but this is not possible within four rolls without the first roll being 3).\n\nTherefore, the only way the running total can be 3 is if the first roll is a 3.

Therefore, we can write the midpoint formula as:\n\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{a + b}{2}, \\frac{\\log_2 a + \\log_2 b}{2} \\right) = (6, 2)\n\\]\n\nThis gives us two equations:\n\n1. \\(\\frac{a + b}{2} = 6\\)\n2. \\(\\frac{\\log_2 a + \\log_2 b}{2} = 2\\)\n\nFrom the first equation, we can solve for \\(a + b\\):\n\n\\[\na + b = 12\n\\]\n\nFrom the second equation, we can solve for \\(\\log_2 a + \\log_2 b\\):\n\n\\[\n\\log_2 a + \\log_2 b = 4 \\implies \\log_2 (ab) = 4 \\implies ab = 2^4 = 16\n\\]\n\nNow we have a system of equations:\n\n1. \\(a + b = 12\\)\n2. \\(ab = 16\\)\n\nWe can solve this system by treating it as a quadratic equation.

For the year 2023, the format is 2023MMDD. We need to ensure that each digit in the 8-digit number 2023MMDD appears an even number of times.\n\nFirst, let's identify the fixed digits in the year 2023:\n- The digit 2 appears 2 times.\n- The digit 0 appears 1 time.\n- The digit 3 appears 1 time.\n\nThis means that the digits M and D must contribute the remaining digits to make sure that each digit in the 8-digit number appears an even number of times. Specifically, the digit M (month) and the digit D (day) must together contribute an odd number of each of the digits 1, 2, 3, and 0 to make up for the odd counts of 0 and 3 in the year.\n\nLet's analyze the possible values for M and D:\n- M can be any digit from 01 to 12.\n- D can be any digit from 01 to 31, depending on the month.\n\nWe need to count the valid (M, D) pairs such that the total count of each digit in 2023MMDD is even.

So we use \\(x = \\frac{200}{29}\\):\n\\[\ny = \\frac{2 \\cdot \\frac{200}{29}}{5} = \\frac{400}{145} = \\frac{80}{29}.\n\\]\nThus, the points of intersection are \\((0, 0)\\) (which is not on the circles) and \\(\\left( \\frac{200}{29}, \\frac{80}{29} \\right)\\).\n\nThe slope of the line passing through the points \\((0, 0)\\) and \\(\\left( \\frac{200}{29}, \\frac{80}{29} \\right)\\) is:\n\\[\n\\text{slope} = \\frac{\\frac{80}{29} - 0}{\\frac{200}{29} - 0} = \\frac{80}{200} = \\frac{2}{5}.\n\\]\nThe slope of the line passing through the points of intersection is \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\). Therefore, \\(m = 2\\) and \\(n = 5\\), and \\(m + n = 2 + 5 = 7\\).\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{7}.\n\\]"

            "To find the maximum area of an isosceles trapezoid with legs of length 1 and one base twice as long as the other, we start by defining the lengths of the bases. Let the lengths of the bases be \\(a\\) and \\(2a\\). We need to find the height of the trapezoid, which we will denote as \\(h\\).\n\nFirst, we drop perpendiculars from the ends of the shorter base \\(a\\) to the longer base \\(2a\\). These perpendiculars will divide the longer base into three segments: two segments of length \\(x\\) (the horizontal projections of the legs) and one segment of length \\(a\\) (the length of the shorter base). Therefore, we have:\n\\[2a = a + 2x \\implies x = \\frac{a}{2}.\\]\n\nNow, we can use the Pythagorean theorem in the right triangle formed by one of the legs, the height \\(h\\), and the segment of length \\(x\\):\n\\[1^2 = h^2 + \\left(\\frac{a}{2}\\right)^2 \\implies 1 = h^2 + \\frac{a^2}{4} \\implies h^2 = 1 - \\frac{a^2}{4} \\implies h = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{a^2}{4}}.\\]\n\nThe area \\(A\\) of the trapezoid is given by the formula:\n\\[A = \\frac{1}{2} \\times (a + 2a) \\times h = \\frac{3a}{2} \\times \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{a^2}{4}} = \\frac{3a}{2} \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{4 - a^2}{4}} = \\frac{3a}{2} \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{4 - a^2}}{2} = \\frac{3a \\sqrt{4 - a^2}}{4}.\\]\n\nTo maximize the area, we need to maximize the function \\(f(a) = \\frac{3a \\sqrt{4 - a^2}}{4}\\).

            "To determine the value of \\( x \\) in Coinland, we need to find the largest amount of money that cannot be formed using the given coin values of 6, 10, and 15 cents. This problem can be approached using the concept of the Frobenius coin problem, which deals with finding the largest number that cannot be expressed as a non-negative integer combination of given coin values.\n\nFirst, we note that the coin values are 6, 10, and 15. We will use the fact that for two coprime integers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), the largest number that cannot be expressed as a non-negative integer combination of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) is given by \\( ab - a - b \\). However, since we have three coin values, we need to consider the problem more carefully.\n\nWe start by checking if any two of the coin values are coprime. The greatest common divisor (gcd) of 6 and 10 is 2, so they are not coprime. The gcd of 6 and 15 is 3, so they are not coprime. The gcd of 10 and 15 is 5, so they are not coprime. Since none of the pairs of coin values are coprime, we need to use a different approach.\n\nWe will use the fact that the largest number that cannot be formed using three coin values can be found by checking the numbers that cannot be formed and identifying the largest one. We will start by checking the numbers that can be formed and then identify the largest number that cannot be formed.\n\nWe will use a systematic approach to check the numbers that can be formed. We will start with the smallest coin value, 6, and check the numbers that can be formed by adding 10 and 15 to the multiples of 6.\n\nLet's list the numbers that can be formed:\n- Using only 6: 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, ...\n- Using 10: 10, 16, 22, 28, 34, ...\n- Using 15: 15, 21, 27, 33, ...\n\nNow, let's check the numbers that can be formed by combining these:\n- 6 + 10 = 16\n- 6 + 15 = 21\n- 10 + 15 = 25\n- 6 + 10 + 15 = 31\n\nWe can see that the numbers that can be formed are 6, 10, 12, 15, 16, 18, 21, 22, 24, 25, 27, 28, 30, 31, ...\n\nBy checking further, we can see that the number 49 cannot be formed using the coin values 6, 10, and 15. To confirm, we can check the numbers around 49:\n- 49 - 6 = 43 (can be formed as 15 + 10 + 15 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10)\n- 49 - 10 = 39 (can be formed as 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 = 49\n\nTherefore, the largest number that cannot be formed is 49.

Since the triangle has an angle of \\(120^\\circ\\), we can use the Law of Cosines to find \\(d\\).\n\nAssume the angle of \\(120^\\circ\\) is opposite the side of length \\(6+2d\\).

Let the least element of \\( B \\) be \\( k \\). Then \\( B \\) must have exactly \\( k \\) elements.\n2. The elements of \\( B \\) must be \\( k, k+1, k+2, \\ldots, k+(k-1) = 2k-1 \\). Therefore, \\( B \\) must be a subset of \\(\\{k, k+1, k+2, \\ldots, 2k-1\\}\\) and must include exactly \\( k \\) elements.\n3. The set \\(\\{k, k+1, k+2, \\ldots, 2k-1\\}\\) has \\( 2k-1-k+1 = k \\) elements, so there is exactly one way to choose \\( k \\) elements from this set, which is the set itself.\n\nNow, we need to determine the possible values of \\( k \\). Since \\( B \\) must be a subset of \\(\\{0, 1, 2, \\ldots, 12\\}\\), the largest possible value of \\( 2k-1 \\) is 12. Therefore, \\( 2k-1 \\leq 12 \\) implies \\( 2k \\leq 13 \\) and \\( k \\leq 6.5 \\). Since \\( k \\) is an integer, the possible values of \\( k \\) are \\( 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 \\).\n\nFor each \\( k \\), there is exactly one subset \\( B \\) that satisfies the condition. Therefore, the total number of such subsets is the number of possible values of \\( k \\), which is 6.\n\nThus, the number of nonempty subsets \\( B \\) of \\(\\{0, 1, 2, \\ldots, 12\\}\\) that have the property that the number of elements in \\( B \\) is equal to the least element of \\( B \\) is \\(\\boxed{6}\\)."

            "To determine the area of the region defined by the inequality \\( | | x | - 1 | + | | y | - 1 | \\le 1 \\), we need to analyze the expression step by step.\n\nFirst, let's introduce new variables to simplify the expression. Let \\( u = |x| \\) and \\( v = |y| \\). The inequality then becomes:\n\\[ |u - 1| + |v - 1| \\le 1. \\]\n\nThis inequality describes a diamond (or square rotated by 45 degrees) centered at \\((1,1)\\) with a \"side length\" of 1. To understand this, we need to consider the different cases for the absolute values.\n\n1. **Case 1: \\( u \\ge 1 \\) and \\( v \\ge 1 \\)**\n   \\[ (u - 1) + (v - 1) \\le 1 \\implies u + v \\le 3. \\]\n\n2. **Case 2: \\( u \\ge 1 \\) and \\( v < 1 \\)**\n   \\[ (u - 1) + (1 - v) \\le 1 \\implies u - v \\le 1. \\]\n\n3. **Case 3: \\( u < 1 \\) and \\( v \\ge 1 \\)**\n   \\[ (1 - u) + (v - 1) \\le 1 \\implies -u + v \\le 1 \\implies v - u \\le 1. \\]\n\n4. **Case 4: \\( u < 1 \\) and \\( v < 1 \\)**\n   \\[ (1 - u) + (1 - v) \\le 1 \\implies -u - v \\le -1 \\implies u + v \\ge 1. \\]\n\nCombining these cases, we see that the region described by \\( |u - 1| + |v - 1| \\le 1 \\) is a square with vertices at \\((2,1)\\), \\((1,2)\\), \\((0,1)\\), and \\((1,0)\\).\n\nNow, we need to translate this back to the original variables \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). Since \\(u = |x|\\) and \\(v = |y|\\), the region in the \\(xy\\)-plane is symmetric with respect to both the \\(x\\)-axis and the \\(y\\)-axis. Therefore, the region is a square with side length \\(2\\sqrt{2}\\) (the distance between \\(x = 1\\) and \\(x = -1\\) when \\(y = 0\\) or \\(x = 0\\) when \\(y = 1\\)).\n\nThe area of this square is:\n\\[ \\text{Area} = (2\\sqrt{2})^2 = 8. \\]\n\nThus, the area of the region is \\(\\boxed{8}\\)."
