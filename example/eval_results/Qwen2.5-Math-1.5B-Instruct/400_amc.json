If we have a pair \\((a, b)\\) where \\(a < b\\), then \\(b \\geq 2a\\). We will consider each possible value for \\(a\\) and determine the corresponding possible values for \\(b\\):\n\n- If \\(a = 1\\), then \\(b \\geq 2 \\cdot 1 = 2\\). So, \\(b\\) can be \\(2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14\\). This gives us 13 possible values for \\(b\\).\n- If \\(a = 2\\), then \\(b \\geq 2 \\cdot 2 = 4\\). So, \\(b\\) can be \\(4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14\\). This gives us 11 possible values for \\(b\\).\n- If \\(a = 3\\), then \\(b \\geq 2 \\cdot 3 = 6\\). So, \\(b\\) can be \\(6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14\\). This gives us 9 possible values for \\(b\\).\n- If \\(a = 4\\), then \\(b \\geq 2 \\cdot 4 = 8\\). So, \\(b\\) can be \\(8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14\\). This gives us 7 possible values for \\(b\\).\n- If \\(a = 5\\), then \\(b \\geq 2 \\cdot 5 = 10\\). So, \\(b\\) can be \\(10, 11, 12, 13, 14\\).

This gives us 1 possible value for \\(b\\).\n\nNow, we need to count the number of ways to form these pairs. We can use the concept of derangements and the principle of inclusion-exclusion, but a simpler approach is to use a combinatorial argument. We need to select 7 pairs from the possible pairs such that each number from 1 to 14 is used exactly once.

The third number is 40 less than the second number.\n\nWe can translate this information into the following equations:\n1. \\(x + y + z = 96\\)\n2. \\(x = 6z\\)\n3. \\(z = y - 40\\)\n\nFirst, we substitute the expression for \\(x\\) from the second equation into the first equation:\n\\[6z + y + z = 96\\]\nCombining like terms, we get:\n\\[7z + y = 96\\]\n\nNext, we substitute the expression for \\(z\\) from the third equation into the equation \\(7z + y = 96\\):\n\\[7(y - 40) + y = 96\\]\nExpanding and combining like terms, we get:\n\\[7y - 280 + y = 96\\]\n\\[8y - 280 = 96\\]\nAdding 280 to both sides, we get:\n\\[8y = 376\\]\nDividing both sides by 8, we get:\n\\[y = 47\\]\n\nNow that we have \\(y\\), we can find \\(z\\) using the third equation:\n\\[z = y - 40\\]\n\\[z = 47 - 40\\]\n\\[z = 7\\]\n\nFinally, we can find \\(x\\) using the second equation:\n\\[x = 6z\\]\n\\[x = 6 \\cdot 7\\]\n\\[x = 42\\]\n\nWe need to find the absolute value of the difference between the first and second numbers:\n\\[|x - y| = |42 - 47| = |-5| = 5\\]\n\nTherefore, the absolute value of the difference between the first and second numbers is \\(\\boxed{5}\\)."

            "To solve for the positive integer \\( n \\) given the conditions, we start by analyzing the least common multiple (LCM) and the greatest common divisor (GCD) conditions.\n\nFirst, we know that the LCM of \\( n \\) and 18 is 180. The prime factorizations are:\n\\[ 18 = 2 \\cdot 3^2 \\]\n\\[ 180 = 2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5 \\]\nThe LCM of two numbers is the product of the highest powers of all prime factors present in either number. Therefore, \\( n \\) must include the factor \\( 2^2 \\) (since 18 only has \\( 2^1 \\) and the LCM has \\( 2^2 \\)), the factor \\( 3^2 \\) (since 18 has \\( 3^2 \\) and the LCM also has \\( 3^2 \\)), and the factor \\( 5 \\) (since 18 does not have 5 and the LCM does). So, \\( n \\) must be of the form:\n\\[ n = 2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5 \\cdot k = 180k \\]\nwhere \\( k \\) is an integer that does not introduce any new prime factors that are not already in 180.\n\nNext, we use the GCD condition. The GCD of \\( n \\) and 45 is 15. The prime factorizations are:\n\\[ 45 = 3^2 \\cdot 5 \\]\n\\[ 15 = 3 \\cdot 5 \\]\nThe GCD of two numbers is the product of the lowest powers of all prime factors present in both numbers. Therefore, \\( n \\) must include the factor \\( 3 \\) and the factor \\( 5 \\), but not any higher powers of these primes than those in 15. Since \\( n = 180k \\) already includes \\( 3^2 \\) and \\( 5 \\), \\( k \\) must be 1 (otherwise, \\( n \\) would have a higher power of 3 than 15). Thus, \\( n = 180 \\).\n\nWe need to verify that \\( n = 180 \\) satisfies both conditions:\n1. The LCM of 180 and 18 is 180, which is true.\n2. The GCD of 180 and 45 is 45, but we need to recheck the prime factorization of 180 to ensure it aligns with the GCD condition. The prime factorization of 180 is \\( 2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5 \\), and the prime factorization of 45 is \\( 3^2 \\cdot 5 \\). The GCD is \\( 3^2 \\cdot 5 = 45 \\), but we need it to be 15. This indicates we need to re-evaluate the form of \\( n \\) to ensure it aligns with the GCD condition. Given the constraints, the only \\( n \\) that fits both conditions is \\( n = 60 \\).\n\nLet's verify \\( n = 60 \\):\n1. The LCM of 60 and 18 is 180, which is true.\n2. The GCD of 60 and 45 is 15, which is true.\n\nThus, the correct \\( n \\) is 60.

So, the number of \"Yes\" answers to this question is \\( T + \\frac{A}{2} \\) (since half of the alternaters will answer \"Yes\" and half will answer \"No\").\n\n2. \"Are you an alternater?\" The truth-tellers will answer \"No,\" the liars will answer \"No,\" and the alternaters will answer \"Yes\" on the first question and \"No\" on the second question, and so on.

So, the number of \"Yes\" answers to this question is \\( \\frac{A}{2} \\).\n\nWe are given the following information:\n- 22 children answered \"Yes\" to the first question.\n- 15 children answered \"Yes\" to the second question.\n- 9 children answered \"Yes\" to the third question.\n\nFrom the first question, we have:\n\\[ T + \\frac{A}{2} = 22. \\]\n\nFrom the second question, we have:\n\\[ \\frac{A}{2} = 15. \\]\nSo, \\( A = 30 \\).\n\nFrom the third question, we have:\n\\[ \\frac{A}{2} = 9. \\]\nBut we already know \\( A = 30 \\), so this is consistent with the previous information.\n\nNow we substitute \\( A = 30 \\) into the equation \\( T + A + L = 31 \\):\n\\[ T + 30 + L = 31, \\]\n\\[ T + L = 1. \\]\n\nAnd we substitute \\( A = 30 \\) into the equation \\( T + \\frac{A}{2} = 22 \\):\n\\[ T + \\frac{30}{2} = 22, \\]\n\\[ T + 15 = 22, \\]\n\\[ T = 7. \\]\n\nSo, \\( L = 1 - T = 1 - 7 = -6 \\), but this is not possible since \\( L \\) must be a non-negative integer. Let's recheck the interpretation of the problem. The correct interpretation should be that the number of \"Yes\" answers to the third question should be consistent with the number of alternaters, which is 30, and the number of \"Yes\" answers to the third question is 9, so the number of liars is 9. Therefore, the number of truth-tellers is \\( T = 31 - 30 - 9 = 2 \\).\n\nSo, the number of truth-tellers is 2, and the principal gave them 2 pieces of candy.

            "To determine the area of the region inside both the square and the rectangle, we start by visualizing the given shapes. The rectangle has side lengths 4 and 8, and the square has a side length of 5. The square is positioned such that three of its vertices lie on three different sides of the rectangle.\n\nLet's place the rectangle in the coordinate plane with vertices at \\((0,0)\\), \\((8,0)\\), \\((8,4)\\), and \\((0,4)\\). Assume the square is positioned such that one of its vertices is at \\((x,0)\\) on the bottom side of the rectangle, another vertex is at \\((8,y)\\) on the right side of the rectangle, and the third vertex is at \\((8-x,4)\\) on the top side of the rectangle. The side length of the square is 5, so the distance between \\((x,0)\\) and \\((8,y)\\) is 5, and the distance between \\((8,y)\\) and \\((8-x,4)\\) is also 5.\n\nSince the distance between \\((x,0)\\) and \\((8,y)\\) is 5, we have:\n\\[\n(8-x)^2 + y^2 = 25\n\\]\nSince the distance between \\((8,y)\\) and \\((8-x,4)\\) is 5, we have:\n\\[\nx^2 + (4-y)^2 = 25\n\\]\n\nWe also know that the side of the square is 5, so the distance between \\((x,0)\\) and \\((8-x,4)\\) is 5, which gives us:\n\\[\n(8-2x)^2 + 4^2 = 25\n\\]\nSimplifying this, we get:\n\\[\n(8-2x)^2 + 16 = 25 \\implies (8-2x)^2 = 9 \\implies 8-2x = \\pm 3\n\\]\nThis gives us two possible solutions:\n\\[\n8-2x = 3 \\implies x = \\frac{5}{2} \\quad \\text{or} \\quad 8-2x = -3 \\implies x = \\frac{11}{2}\n\\]\nSince \\(x\\) must be between 0 and 8, we have \\(x = \\frac{5}{2}\\).

This circle is tangent to the three given circles, so the distance from the center of this circle to the center of each of the given circles is equal to the sum or the difference of their radii.\n\nThe centers of the given circles are \\((0,0)\\), \\((0,0)\\), and \\((5,0)\\) with radii 2, 8, and \\(\\sqrt{3}\\) respectively. Let the center of the circle in \\( S \\) be \\((h,k)\\) and its radius be \\( r \\). Then we have the following distance conditions:\n\n1. The distance from \\((h,k)\\) to \\((0,0)\\) is \\( r + 2 \\) or \\( r - 2 \\).\n2. The distance from \\((h,k)\\) to \\((0,0)\\) is \\( r + 8 \\) or \\( r - 8 \\).\n3. The distance from \\((h,k)\\) to \\((5,0)\\) is \\( r + \\sqrt{3} \\) or \\( r - \\sqrt{3} \\).\n\nFrom the first two conditions, we can see that \\( r + 2 \\) and \\( r + 8 \\) must be equal or differ by 10. Therefore, we have two cases to consider:\n\n**Case 1:** \\( r + 2 = r + 8 \\) (which is not possible) or \\( r + 2 = r + 8 - 10 \\) (which is also not possible).\n\n**Case 2:** \\( r + 2 = r + 8 - 10 \\) simplifies to \\( r + 2 = r - 2 \\) (which is not possible) or \\( r + 2 = r + 8 + 10 \\) (which is also not possible).\n\nThe only feasible case is when the distances are such that the circle is externally tangent to two of the given circles and internally tangent to the third. This gives us the equations:\n\n1. \\( \\sqrt{h^2 + k^2} = r + 2 \\)\n2. \\( \\sqrt{h^2 + k^2} = r + 8 \\)\n3. \\( \\sqrt{(h-5)^2 + k^2} = r + \\sqrt{3} \\)\n\nFrom the first two equations, we get \\( r + 2 = r + 8 - 10 \\), which is not possible. So we need to consider the correct geometric configuration. The correct configuration is when the circle is externally tangent to two of the given circles and internally tangent to the third. This gives us the equations:\n\n1. \\( \\sqrt{h^2 + k^2} = r + 2 \\)\n2. \\( \\sqrt{h^2 + k^2} = r + 8 \\)\n3. \\( \\sqrt{(h-5)^2 + k^2} = r + \\sqrt{3} \\)\n\nSolving these, we get two possible values for \\( r \\). Let's solve for \\( r \\):\n\nFrom \\( \\sqrt{h^2 + k^2} = r + 2 \\) and \\( \\sqrt{h^2 + k^2} = r + 8 \\), we get \\( r + 2 = r + 8 - 10 \\), which is not possible. So we need to consider the correct geometric configuration. The correct configuration is when the circle is externally tangent to two of the given circles and internally tangent to the third. This gives us the equations:\n\n1. \\( \\sqrt{h^2 + k^2} = r + 2 \\)\n2. \\( \\sqrt{h^2 + k^2} = r + 8 \\)\n3. \\( \\sqrt{(h-5)^2 + k^2} = r + \\sqrt{3} \\)\n\nSolving these, we get two possible values for \\( r \\). Let's solve for \\( r \\):\n\nFrom the correct geometric configuration, we get the radii \\( r = 3 \\) and \\( r = 15 \\). The areas of the circles are \\( \\pi \\cdot 3^2 = 9\\pi \\) and \\( \\pi \\cdot 15^2 = 225\\pi \\). The sum of the areas is \\( 9\\pi + 225\\pi = 234\\pi \\). The remainder when 234 is divided by 100 is 34.\n\nThus, the answer is \\( \\boxed{34} \\)."

Thus, we have:\n\n\\[\n\\log_{7x}2023 = \\frac{\\log_{10}2023}{\\log_{10}(7x)}, \\quad \\log_{289x}2023 = \\frac{\\log_{10}2023}{\\log_{10}(289x)}, \\quad \\log_{2023x}2023 = \\frac{\\log_{10}2023}{\\log_{10}(2023x)}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting these into the original equation, we get:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\log_{10}2023}{\\log_{10}(7x)} \\cdot \\frac{\\log_{10}2023}{\\log_{10}(289x)} = \\frac{\\log_{10}2023}{\\log_{10}(2023x)}\n\\]\n\nWe can cancel \\(\\log_{10}2023\\) from both sides of the equation (assuming \\(\\log_{10}2023 \\neq 0\\)):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\log_{10}2023}{\\log_{10}(7x)} \\cdot \\frac{\\log_{10}2023}{\\log_{10}(289x)} = \\frac{\\log_{10}2023}{\\log_{10}(2023x)}\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\log_{10}2023}{\\log_{10}(7x) \\log_{10}(289x)} = \\frac{\\log_{10}2023}{\\log_{10}(2023x)}\n\\]\n\nAgain, we can cancel \\(\\log_{10}2023\\) from both sides (assuming \\(\\log_{10}2023 \\neq 0\\)):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{\\log_{10}(7x) \\log_{10}(289x)} = \\frac{1}{\\log_{10}(2023x)}\n\\]\n\nThis implies:\n\n\\[\n\\log_{10}(7x) \\log_{10}(289x) = \\log_{10}(2023x)\n\\]\n\nWe can express \\(289x\\) and \\(2023x\\) in terms of their prime factorizations: \\(289 = 17^2\\) and \\(2023 = 7 \\cdot 17^2\\). Therefore, we have:\n\n\\[\n\\log_{10}(7x) \\log_{10}(17^2 x) = \\log_{10}(7 \\cdot 17^2 x)\n\\]\n\nUsing the properties of logarithms, we get:\n\n\\[\n\\log_{10}(7x) \\log_{10}(17^2 x) = \\log_{10}(7) + \\log_{10}(17^2) + \\log_{10}(x)\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n\\log_{10}(7x) (2 \\log_{10}(17) + \\log_{10}(x)) = \\log_{10}(7) + 2 \\log_{10}(17) + \\log_{10}(x)\n\\]\n\nLet \\(a = \\log_{10}(x)\\), \\(b = \\log_{10}(7)\\), and \\(c = \\log_{10}(17)\\). Then the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)(2c + a) = b + 2c + a\n\\]\n\nExpanding the left side, we get:\n\n\\[\na(2c + a) + b(2c + a) = b + 2c + a\n\\]\n\n\\[\n2ac + a^2 + 2bc + ab = b + 2c + a\n\\]\n\nRearranging terms, we get:\n\n\\[\na^2 + a(b + 2c) + 2ac - b - 2c - a = 0\n\\]\n\n\\[\na^2 + a(b + 2c - 1) + 2ac - b - 2c = 0\n\\]\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in \\(a\\). The solutions to this quadratic equation are given by the quadratic formula \\(a = \\frac{-B \\pm \\sqrt{B^2 - 4AC}}{2A}\\), where \\(A = 1\\), \\(B = b + 2c - 1\\), and \\(C = 2ac - b - 2c\\). However, we can also solve this by factoring or using the properties of logarithms. Notice that if \\(x = 1\\), then \\(a = \\log_{10}(1) = 0\\), and substituting \\(a = 0\\) into the equation, we get:\n\n\\[\n0^2 + 0(b + 2c - 1) + 2 \\cdot 0 \\cdot c - b - 2c = 0\n\\]\n\n\\[\n-b - 2c = 0\n\\]\n\n\\[\nb + 2c = 0\n\\]\n\nSince \\(b = \\log_{10}(7)\\) and \\(c = \\log_{10}(17)\\), this equation is not generally true. However, we can check the other possible solutions. If \\(x = 17\\), then \\(a = \\log_{10}(17)\\), and substituting \\(a = \\log_{10}(17)\\) into the equation, we get:\n\n\\[\n(\\log_{10}(17))^2 + \\log_{10}(17)(b + 2c - 1) + 2 \\log_{10}(17)c - b - 2c = 0\n\\]\n\nThis is a more complex equation to solve directly, but we can use the fact that the product of the roots of the quadratic equation \\(a^2 + a(b + 2c - 1) + 2ac - b - 2c = 0\\) is given by \\(\\frac{C}{A} = 2ac - b - 2c\\). However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that the product of the solutions to the original equation is the product of the values of \\(x\\) that satisfy the equation. By the properties of logarithms and the structure of the equation, we can deduce that the product of the solutions is \\(17\\).\n\nThus, the product of all solutions to the equation is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{17}\n\\]"

            "To determine how many dates in 2023 will have each digit appearing an even number of times in the 8-digit display, we need to analyze the structure of the date format, which is YMMDD, where Y is the year, M is the month, and D is the day. For the year 2023, the format is 2023MMDD. We need to ensure that each digit in the 8-digit number 2023MMDD appears an even number of times.\n\nFirst, let's identify the fixed digits in the year 2023:\n- The digits 2, 0, 2, and 3 each appear once.\n- The digits M and D are the variable parts of the date.\n\nFor each digit to appear an even number of times in the 8-digit number 2023MMDD, the digits M and D must collectively contribute an even number of each digit that is not already contributed by the year. Specifically, the digit 2 must appear an odd number of times in the year (since it appears twice), so M and D must contribute an odd number of 2's in total. This means that one of M or D must be 2, and the other must be an even digit (0, 2, 4, 6, 8) to ensure the total count of 2's is odd.\n\nLet's break this down further:\n1. If M is 2, then D must be an even digit (0, 2, 4, 6, 8).\n2. If D is 2, then M must be an even digit (0, 2, 4, 6, 8).\n\nWe need to count the valid combinations for each case:\n1. If M is 2, then D can be 0, 4, 6, or 8 (4 choices).\n2. If D is 2, then M can be 0, 4, 6, or 8 (4 choices), but we must exclude the case where M is also 2 to avoid double counting. So, there are 4 - 1 = 3 choices for M when D is 2.\n\nAdding these together, we get:\n- 4 choices when M is 2.\n- 3 choices when D is 2.\n\nThus, the total number of valid dates is 4 + 3 = 7.\n\nTherefore, the number of dates in 2023 for which each digit appears an even number of times in the 8-digit display is \\(\\boxed{12}\\)."

First, we compute \\( z^2 \\):\n\\[\nz^2 = (x + yi)^2 = x^2 + 2xyi + (yi)^2 = x^2 + 2xyi - y^2 = (x^2 - y^2) + 2xyi.\n\\]\nSince \\( z \\otimes z \\) is the real part of \\( z^2 \\), we have:\n\\[\nz \\otimes z = x^2 - y^2.\n\\]\nThus, the given equation \\( z \\otimes z = z^2 + 40 \\) becomes:\n\\[\nx^2 - y^2 = (x^2 - y^2) + 2xyi + 40.\n\\]\nBy comparing the real and imaginary parts, we see that the imaginary part must be zero, so \\( 2xy = 0 \\). This implies that either \\( x = 0 \\) or \\( y = 0 \\).\n\n**Case 1: \\( x = 0 \\)**\nIf \\( x = 0 \\), then \\( z = yi \\) and \\( z^2 = (yi)^2 = -y^2 \\). The equation becomes:\n\\[\n-y^2 = -y^2 + 40,\n\\]\nwhich simplifies to \\( 0 = 40 \\), a contradiction. Therefore, \\( x \\neq 0 \\).\n\n**Case 2: \\( y = 0 \\)**\nIf \\( y = 0 \\), then \\( z = x \\) and \\( z^2 = x^2 \\). The equation becomes:\n\\[\nx^2 = x^2 + 40,\n\\]\nwhich simplifies to \\( 0 = 40 \\), a contradiction. Therefore, \\( y \\neq 0 \\).\n\nSince \\( x \\neq 0 \\) and \\( y \\neq 0 \\), we must have \\( 2xy = 0 \\), which is not possible under the given conditions. However, we can still solve for \\( x^2 - y^2 \\) directly from the equation \\( x^2 - y^2 = x^2 - y^2 + 40 \\), which simplifies to \\( 0 = 40 \\), a contradiction. This indicates we need to re-evaluate the problem with the correct interpretation of the operation.\n\nGiven the correct interpretation, we have:\n\\[\nx^2 - y^2 = x^2 - y^2 + 40 \\implies 0 = 40,\n\\]\nwhich is a contradiction unless we consider the magnitude. The correct approach is to recognize that the imaginary part must be zero, and the real part must satisfy the equation.

            "To determine the value of \\( x \\) in Coinland, we need to find the largest amount of money that cannot be formed using the given coin values of 6, 10, and 15 cents. This problem can be approached using the concept of the Frobenius coin problem, which deals with finding the largest number that cannot be expressed as a non-negative integer combination of given coin values.\n\nFirst, we note that the problem is simplified by the fact that the greatest common divisor (gcd) of 6, 10, and 15 is 1. This means that any sufficiently large amount of money can be formed using these coins. We need to find the largest amount that cannot be formed.\n\nWe start by considering the two smallest coin values, 6 and 10, and use the fact that the Frobenius number for two coprime integers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) is given by \\( ab - a - b \\). However, since we have three coin values, we need to check if the addition of the third coin (15 cents) affects the Frobenius number.\n\nWe will use the fact that the largest number that cannot be formed using 6 and 10 cents is 14 (since 14 = 10 + 6 - 2*6, and any number greater than 14 can be formed by combining 6 and 10). Now, we need to check if adding the 15 cent coin changes this number.\n\nWe will check the numbers from 15 to 29 to see if they can be formed using 6, 10, and 15 cents:\n- 15 = 15\n- 16 = 10 + 6\n- 17 = 10 + 10 - 3*6\n- 18 = 10 + 10 + 10 - 3*6\n- 19 = 15 + 10 - 6\n- 20 = 10 + 10\n- 21 = 15 + 15 - 3*6\n- 22 = 15 + 10 + 10 - 3*6\n- 23 = 15 + 10 + 10 - 2*6\n- 24 = 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 - 4*6\n- 25 = 15 + 10 + 10 - 3*6\n- 26 = 15 + 10 + 10 - 2*6\n- 27 = 15 + 10 + 10 - 1*6\n- 28 = 15 + 10 + 10 - 0*6\n- 29 = 15 + 15 - 1*6\n\nFrom the above, we see that 29 is the largest number that cannot be formed using 6, 10, and 15 cents.

            "Given that the side lengths of triangle \\(ABC\\) are in arithmetic progression and the smallest side has length 6, we can denote the side lengths as \\(6\\), \\(6+d\\), and \\(6+2d\\), where \\(d\\) is the common difference. Since the triangle has an angle of \\(120^\\circ\\), we can use the Law of Cosines to find \\(d\\).\n\nThe Law of Cosines states that for a triangle with sides \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) and an angle \\(\\theta\\) opposite side \\(c\\), we have:\n\\[ c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \\cos \\theta. \\]\nIn our case, let the side opposite the \\(120^\\circ\\) angle be \\(6+2d\\). Then we have:\n\\[ (6+2d)^2 = 6^2 + (6+d)^2 - 2 \\cdot 6 \\cdot (6+d) \\cdot \\cos 120^\\circ. \\]\nSince \\(\\cos 120^\\circ = -\\frac{1}{2}\\), the equation becomes:\n\\[ (6+2d)^2 = 36 + (6+d)^2 + 6(6+d). \\]\nExpanding both sides, we get:\n\\[ 36 + 24d + 4d^2 = 36 + 36 + 12d + d^2 + 36 + 6d, \\]\n\\[ 36 + 24d + 4d^2 = 108 + 18d + d^2. \\]\nRearranging terms, we have:\n\\[ 3d^2 + 6d - 72 = 0, \\]\n\\[ d^2 + 2d - 24 = 0. \\]\nWe solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \\(d = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\), where \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 2\\), and \\(c = -24\\):\n\\[ d = \\frac{-2 \\pm \\sqrt{2^2 - 4 \\cdot 1 \\cdot (-24)}}{2 \\cdot 1} = \\frac{-2 \\pm \\sqrt{4 + 96}}{2} = \\frac{-2 \\pm \\sqrt{100}}{2} = \\frac{-2 \\pm 10}{2}. \\]\nThis gives us two solutions: \\(d = 4\\) and \\(d = -6\\). Since \\(d\\) must be positive, we have \\(d = 4\\).\n\nThus, the side lengths of the triangle are 6, 10, and 14. To find the area of the triangle, we use the formula for the area of a triangle with sides \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) and an angle \\(\\theta\\) opposite side \\(c\\):\n\\[ \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2}ab \\sin \\theta. \\]\nHere, we can use the sides 6 and 10 with the angle between them being \\(120^\\circ\\):\n\\[ \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 6 \\cdot 10 \\cdot \\sin 120^\\circ = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 6 \\cdot 10 \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} = 15\\sqrt{3}. \\]\nThus, the area of triangle \\(ABC\\) is \\(15\\sqrt{3}\\). In the form \\(m\\sqrt{n}\\), we have \\(m = 15\\) and \\(n = 3\\), so \\(m+n = 15+3 = 18\\).\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{18}. \\]"

            "To determine the value of \\( n \\) such that the product of the numbers rolled on \\( n \\) standard six-sided dice can be any of 936 possible values, we need to analyze the prime factorization of the possible products.

If placed vertically, it can cover any of the following pairs of squares: (1,4), (2,5), (3,6), (4,7), (5,8), (6,9).\n\nThere are 6 possible horizontal placements and 6 possible vertical placements, giving us a total of 12 possible placements for the rectangle.\n\nTo ensure that we cover at least one square of the rectangle, we need to consider the worst-case scenario where the rectangle is placed in such a way that it avoids our guesses as long as possible. We can use a strategy of guessing squares in a way that maximizes the number of possible placements of the rectangle that we cannot eliminate with each guess.\n\nOne effective strategy is to guess the center square of the grid, which is the square at position (2,2). If the center square is not covered, the rectangle cannot be placed in the top-left or bottom-right corners (which are the only corners that could be covered if the center square is not covered). This leaves us with the top-right, bottom-left, and the three middle squares of the top and bottom rows (excluding the center column) as possible placements for the rectangle. This means that if we guess the center square and it is not covered, we have reduced the number of possible placements to 9.\n\nNext, we can guess one of the squares in the middle row, for example, the square at position (2,1). If this square is not covered, the rectangle cannot be placed in the top-left or bottom-left corners. This leaves us with the top-right, bottom-right, and the two middle squares of the left and right columns (excluding the center row) as possible placements for the rectangle. This means that if we guess the square at position (2,1) and it is not covered, we have reduced the number of possible placements to 6.\n\nWe can continue this process by guessing the square at position (2,3). If this square is not covered, the rectangle cannot be placed in the top-right or bottom-right corners. This leaves us with the top-left, bottom-left, and the two middle squares of the left and right columns (excluding the center row) as possible placements for the rectangle. This means that if we guess the square at position (2,3) and it is not covered, we have reduced the number of possible placements to 3.\n\nAt this point, we have reduced the number of possible placements to 3, and we can guess one of the squares in the middle column, for example, the square at position (1,2). If this square is not covered, the rectangle cannot be placed in the top-left or bottom-left corners. This leaves us with the top-right, bottom-right, and the two middle squares of the top and bottom rows (excluding the center column) as possible placements for the rectangle. However, since we have already eliminated the top-left and bottom-left corners, the only possible placement left is the square at position (3,2). Therefore, if we guess the square at position (1,2) and it is not covered, we have identified the square at position (3,2) as being covered by the rectangle.\n\nThus, the minimum number of turns required to ensure that at least one of the guessed squares is covered by the rectangle is \\(\\boxed{5}\\)."
