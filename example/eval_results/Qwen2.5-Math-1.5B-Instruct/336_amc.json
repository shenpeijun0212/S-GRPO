If we have a pair \\((a, b)\\) where \\(a < b\\), then \\(b \\geq 2a\\). We will consider each possible value for \\(a\\) and determine the corresponding possible values for \\(b\\):\n\n- If \\(a = 1\\), then \\(b \\geq 2 \\cdot 1 = 2\\).

            "To determine the area of the region inside both the square and the rectangle, we start by visualizing the given shapes. The rectangle has side lengths 4 and 8, and the square has a side length of 5. The square is positioned such that three of its vertices lie on three different sides of the rectangle.\n\nLet's place the rectangle in the coordinate plane with vertices at \\((0,0)\\), \\((8,0)\\), \\((8,4)\\), and \\((0,4)\\). Assume the square is positioned such that one of its vertices is at \\((x,0)\\) on the bottom side of the rectangle, another vertex is at \\((8,y)\\) on the right side of the rectangle, and the third vertex is at \\((8-x,4)\\) on the top side of the rectangle.\n\nSince the side length of the square is 5, the distance between \\((x,0)\\) and \\((8,y)\\) is 5. Similarly, the distance between \\((8,y)\\) and \\((8-x,4)\\) is 5. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the coordinates of the vertices of the square.\n\nFirst, we calculate the distance between \\((x,0)\\) and \\((8,y)\\):\n\\[\n\\sqrt{(8-x)^2 + y^2} = 5\n\\]\nSquaring both sides, we get:\n\\[\n(8-x)^2 + y^2 = 25\n\\]\nNext, we calculate the distance between \\((8,y)\\) and \\((8-x,4)\\):\n\\[\n\\sqrt{(8-x - 8)^2 + (4-y)^2} = 5\n\\]\nSimplifying, we get:\n\\[\nx^2 + (4-y)^2 = 25\n\\]\nWe now have two equations:\n1. \\((8-x)^2 + y^2 = 25\\)\n2. \\(x^2 + (4-y)^2 = 25\\)\n\nExpanding both equations, we get:\n1. \\(64 - 16x + x^2 + y^2 = 25\\)\n2. \\(x^2 + 16 - 8y + y^2 = 25\\)\n\nSimplifying these, we get:\n1. \\(x^2 + y^2 - 16x = -39\\)\n2. \\(x^2 + y^2 - 8y = 9\\)\n\nSubtracting the second equation from the first, we get:\n\\[\n-16x + 8y = -48\n\\]\nSimplifying, we get:\n\\[\n-2x + y = -6 \\implies y = 2x - 6\n\\]\nSubstituting \\(y = 2x - 6\\) into the second equation \\(x^2 + y^2 - 8y = 9\\), we get:\n\\[\nx^2 + (2x-6)^2 - 8(2x-6) = 9\n\\]\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n\\[\nx^2 + 4x^2 - 24x + 36 - 16x + 48 = 9\n\\]\n\\[\n5x^2 - 40x + 84 = 9\n\\]\n\\[\n5x^2 - 40x + 75 = 0\n\\]\nDividing by 5, we get:\n\\[\nx^2 - 8x + 15 = 0\n\\]\nFactoring, we get:\n\\[\n(x-3)(x-5) = 0\n\\]\nSo, \\(x = 3\\) or \\(x = 5\\). If \\(x = 3\\), then \\(y = 2(3) - 6 = 0\\), which is not possible since the square would not fit. If \\(x = 5\\), then \\(y = 2(5) - 6 = 4\\), which is possible.\n\nSo, the coordinates of the vertices of the square are \\((5,0)\\), \\((8,4)\\), and \\((3,4)\\). The area of the region inside both the square and the rectangle is the area of the square minus the area of the part of the square that is outside the rectangle. The part of the square that is outside the rectangle is a right triangle with legs of length 2 and 4. The area of this triangle is:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} \\times 2 \\times 4 = 4\n\\]\nSo, the area of the region inside both the square and the rectangle is:\n\\[\n25 - 4 = 21\n\\]\nThe fraction representing the area of the region inside both the square and the rectangle is \\(\\frac{21}{25}\\).

We know that both sets of sums must be permutations of \\(\\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}\\).\n\nWe can use the fact that the sum of all row sums must equal the sum of all column sums.

Therefore, we need to find the number of ways to arrange the row sums and column sums such that the resulting array is valid.\n\nWe can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion and combinatorial arguments to count the number of such arrays. However, a more straightforward approach is to use the fact that the problem is equivalent to counting the number of \\(4 \\times 4\\) binary matrices with specified row and column sums.\n\nThe number of such matrices is given by the formula for the number of \\(0-1\\) matrices with specified row and column sums, which is the coefficient of \\(x_1^{r_1} x_2^{r_2} x_3^{r_3} x_4^{r_4} y_1^{c_1} y_2^{c_2} y_3^{c_3} y_4^{c_4}\\) in the expansion of the generating function \\((x_1 + y_1)(x_1 + x_2 + y_1 + y_2)(x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + y_1 + y_2 + y_3)(x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + y_1 + y_2 + y_3 + y_4)\\).\n\nHowever, a simpler combinatorial approach is to use the fact that the number of such matrices is the same as the number of ways to permute the rows and columns of a matrix with a specific pattern of \\(1\\)s and \\(0\\)s that satisfies the given row and column sums.\n\nAfter careful consideration and combinatorial counting, we find that the number of such matrices is 90.

The center of this circle is at a distance \\( r \\) from each of the three given circles.

            "To determine the probability that Amelia's position when she stops will be greater than 1, we need to analyze the possible outcomes of her movements step by step.\n\nFirst, let's define the random variables:\n- \\( t_n \\) is the time duration for the \\( n \\)-th step, chosen uniformly from the interval \\((0,1)\\).\n- \\( x_n \\) is the increment for the \\( n \\)-th step, chosen uniformly from the interval \\((0,1)\\).\n\nAnt Amelia will stop after the first step if \\( t_1 \\leq 1 \\), after the second step if \\( t_1 + t_2 \\leq 1 \\), and after the third step if \\( t_1 + t_2 + t_3 \\leq 1 \\). However, since she stops after at most 3 steps, we need to consider the probability that she stops after each step and the position at that stop.\n\n### Case 1: She stops after the first step\nFor her to stop after the first step, \\( t_1 \\leq 1 \\) and \\( x_1 > 1 \\). Since \\( x_1 \\) is chosen from \\((0,1)\\), the probability that \\( x_1 > 1 \\) is 0. Therefore, the probability that she stops after the first step is 0.\n\n### Case 2: She stops after the second step\nFor her to stop after the second step, \\( t_1 + t_2 \\leq 1 \\) and \\( x_1 + x_2 > 1 \\). The probability that \\( t_1 + t_2 \\leq 1 \\) is the area of the region in the unit square \\((0,1) \\times (0,1)\\) below the line \\( t_1 + t_2 = 1 \\), which is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\).

Therefore, the probability that she stops after the third step is \\(\\frac{1}{6} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{12}\\).\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that her position when she stops is greater than 1. This can happen in two scenarios:\n1. She stops after the second step with \\( x_1 + x_2 > 1 \\).\n2. She stops after the third step with \\( x_1 + x_2 + x_3 > 1 \\).\n\nThe probability that \\( x_1 + x_2 > 1 \\) given that \\( t_1 + t_2 \\leq 1 \\) is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\). Therefore, the probability that she stops after the second step with \\( x_1 + x_2 > 1 \\) is \\(\\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{8}\\).\n\nThe probability that \\( x_1 + x_2 + x_3 > 1 \\) given that \\( t_1 + t_2 + t_3 \\leq 1 \\) is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\). Therefore, the probability that she stops after the third step with \\( x_1 + x_2 + x_3 > 1 \\) is \\(\\frac{1}{12} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{24}\\).\n\nAdding these probabilities together, the total probability that her position when she stops is greater than 1 is \\(\\frac{1}{8} + \\frac{1}{24} = \\frac{3}{24} + \\frac{1}{24} = \\frac{4}{24} = \\frac{1}{6}\\).\n\nThe denominator plus the numerator of the probability is \\(6 + 1 = 7\\).\n\nThus, the answer is \\(\\boxed{7}\\)."

The number of terms in this sequence can be found by solving the equation:\n\\[ 7n \\leq 1000 \\implies n \\leq \\frac{1000}{7} \\approx 142.857. \\]\nSo, there are 142 multiples of 7 in the range from 1 to 1000.\n\nNow, we need to determine how these multiples of 7 are distributed across the sets. Each set of 10 consecutive integers will contain exactly one multiple of 7 if the set starts with a number that is not a multiple of 7. For example, the set \\{1, 2, 3, ..., 10\\} contains the multiple of 7, which is 7. The set \\{11, 12, 13, ..., 20\\} also contains the multiple of 7, which is 14.

However, we need to exclude the sets that start with a number that is not a multiple of 7.

The running total can be 3 if the last roll is a 3, or if the running total before the last roll is 1 or 2 and the last roll is 2 or 1, respectively.

This gives us the sequence (1, 1, 1, 3).\n\n2. **Case 2: The running total before the last roll is 1.**\n   - The first roll must be 1, and the next three rolls can be any combination of numbers that sum to 2.

            "To find the maximum area of an isosceles trapezoid with legs of length 1 and one base twice as long as the other, we start by defining the lengths of the bases. Let the lengths of the bases be \\(a\\) and \\(2a\\). We need to find the height of the trapezoid, which we will denote as \\(h\\).\n\nFirst, we drop perpendiculars from the endpoints of the shorter base \\(a\\) to the longer base \\(2a\\). These perpendiculars will divide the longer base into three segments: two segments of length \\(x\\) (the horizontal projections of the legs) and one segment of length \\(a\\) (the length of the shorter base).

For each set, we can determine the corresponding values of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\):\n\n1.

For \\((-1, 2, -3)\\):\n   \\[\n   a = -(-1 + 2 - 3) = 2, \\quad b = (-1) \\cdot 2 + 2 \\cdot (-3) + (-3) \\cdot (-1) = -2 - 6 + 3 = -5\n   \\]\n   So, \\((a, b) = (2, -5)\\).\n\n4. For \\((-1, -2, 3)\\):\n   \\[\n   a = -(-1 - 2 + 3) = 0, \\quad b = (-1) \\cdot (-2) + (-2) \\cdot 3 + 3 \\cdot (-1) = 2 - 6 - 3 = -7\n   \\]\n   So, \\((a, b) = (0, -7)\\).\n\nWe see that the distinct ordered pairs \\((a, b)\\) are \\((0, -7)\\), \\((-2, -5)\\), and \\((2, -5)\\). Therefore, there are 6 distinct ordered pairs \\((a, b)\\) of integers such that the polynomial \\(x^3 + ax^2 + bx + 6\\) has three distinct integer roots. The correct answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{22}\n\\]"

            "To determine the value of \\( x \\) in Coinland, we need to find the largest amount of money that cannot be formed using the given coin values of 6, 10, and 15 cents. This problem can be approached using the concept of the Frobenius coin problem, which deals with finding the largest number that cannot be expressed as a non-negative integer combination of given coin values.\n\nFirst, we note that the problem is simplified by the fact that the greatest common divisor (gcd) of 6, 10, and 15 is 1. This means that any sufficiently large amount of money can be formed using these coins. We need to find the largest amount that cannot be formed.\n\nWe start by considering the two smallest coin values, 6 and 10, and use the fact that the Frobenius number for two coprime integers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) is given by \\( ab - a - b \\). However, since we have three coin values, we need to check if the addition of the third coin (15 cents) affects the Frobenius number.\n\nWe will use the fact that the Frobenius number for 6 and 10 is \\( 6 \\cdot 10 - 6 - 10 = 50 \\). This means that any amount greater than 50 cents can be formed using only 6 and 10 cent coins. We need to check if the addition of the 15 cent coin changes this.\n\nWe will check the amounts from 51 to 55 to see if they can be formed using 6, 10, and 15 cent coins:\n- 51: Not possible (51 is not a multiple of 6 or 10, and adding 15 does not help).\n- 52: Not possible (52 is not a multiple of 6 or 10, and adding 15 does not help).\n- 53: Not possible (53 is not a multiple of 6 or 10, and adding 15 does not help).\n- 54: Possible (54 = 9 * 6).\n- 55: Possible (55 = 5 * 11, but we need to check if it can be formed with 6, 10, and 15). 55 = 5 * 15 - 5 * 10 + 5 * 6 = 5(15 - 10 + 6) = 5 * 11, but we need to check smaller combinations. 55 = 15 + 15 + 15 - 10 - 10 = 15 * 3 - 10 * 2, so it is possible.\n\nSince 51, 52, and 53 cannot be formed, we need to check if there is a larger number that cannot be formed. We will check 59:\n- 59: Not possible (59 is not a multiple of 6 or 10, and adding 15 does not help).\n\nWe need to check if there is a larger number that cannot be formed. We will check 59:\n- 59: Not possible (59 is not a multiple of 6 or 10, and adding 15 does not help).\n\nAfter checking, we find that the largest number that cannot be formed is 43. We can verify this by checking that 43 cannot be formed using 6, 10, and 15, but any number greater than 43 can be formed.\n\nTherefore, the value of \\( x \\) is 43, and the sum of the digits of 43 is \\( 4 + 3 = 7 \\).\n\nThe answer is \\(\\boxed{7}\\)."

Since the triangle has an angle of \\(120^\\circ\\), we can use the Law of Cosines to find \\(d\\).\n\nThe Law of Cosines states that for a triangle with sides \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) and angle \\(\\gamma\\) opposite side \\(c\\), we have:\n\\[ c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \\cos(\\gamma). \\]\nIn our case, let the side opposite the \\(120^\\circ\\) angle be \\(6+2d\\). Then we have:\n\\[ (6+2d)^2 = 6^2 + (6+d)^2 - 2 \\cdot 6 \\cdot (6+d) \\cdot \\cos(120^\\circ). \\]\nSince \\(\\cos(120^\\circ) = -\\frac{1}{2}\\), the equation becomes:\n\\[ (6+2d)^2 = 36 + (6+d)^2 + 6(6+d). \\]\nExpanding both sides, we get:\n\\[ 36 + 24d + 4d^2 = 36 + 36 + 12d + d^2 + 36 + 6d, \\]\n\\[ 36 + 24d + 4d^2 = 108 + 18d + d^2. \\]\nRearranging terms, we have:\n\\[ 3d^2 + 6d - 72 = 0, \\]\n\\[ d^2 + 2d - 24 = 0. \\]\nWe solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \\(d = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\), where \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 2\\), and \\(c = -24\\):\n\\[ d = \\frac{-2 \\pm \\sqrt{2^2 - 4 \\cdot 1 \\cdot (-24)}}{2 \\cdot 1} = \\frac{-2 \\pm \\sqrt{4 + 96}}{2} = \\frac{-2 \\pm \\sqrt{100}}{2} = \\frac{-2 \\pm 10}{2}. \\]\nThis gives us two solutions: \\(d = 4\\) and \\(d = -6\\). Since \\(d\\) must be positive, we have \\(d = 4\\).\n\nThus, the side lengths of the triangle are 6, 10, and 14. To find the area of the triangle, we use the formula for the area of a triangle with sides \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and included angle \\(\\theta\\):\n\\[ \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2}ab \\sin(\\theta). \\]\nHere, \\(a = 6\\), \\(b = 10\\), and \\(\\theta = 120^\\circ\\), so \\(\\sin(120^\\circ) = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\). Therefore, the area is:\n\\[ \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 6 \\cdot 10 \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} = 15\\sqrt{3}. \\]\nThe area of triangle \\(ABC\\) is \\(15\\sqrt{3}\\).

            "To determine the value of \\( n \\) such that the product of the numbers rolled on \\( n \\) standard six-sided dice can be any of 936 possible values, we need to analyze the prime factorization of the possible products.\n\nA standard six-sided die has faces numbered 1 through 6. The prime factorizations of these numbers are:\n\\[\n1 = 1, \\quad 2 = 2, \\quad 3 = 3, \\quad 4 = 2^2, \\quad 5 = 5, \\quad 6 = 2 \\cdot 3\n\\]\nWhen \\( n \\) dice are rolled, the product of the numbers rolled will be a number whose prime factorization is the sum of the prime factorizations of the numbers on each die. The possible prime factors are 2, 3, and 5. We need to determine how many different combinations of these prime factors can be formed.\n\nLet's denote the number of dice showing a number with a factor of 2 by \\( a \\), the number of dice showing a number with a factor of 3 by \\( b \\), and the number of dice showing a number with a factor of 5 by \\( c \\). The possible values for \\( a \\) range from 0 to \\( n \\), the possible values for \\( b \\) range from 0 to \\( n \\), and the possible values for \\( c \\) range from 0 to \\( n \\). However, we need to consider the constraints on the exponents of the prime factors.\n\nThe exponent of 2 in the product can range from 0 to \\( 2a + b \\), where \\( a \\) is the number of dice showing 4 or 6, and \\( b \\) is the number of dice showing 2 or 6. The exponent of 3 can range from 0 to \\( a + 2b \\), and the exponent of 5 can range from 0 to \\( c \\).\n\nTo find the number of distinct products, we need to count the number of distinct combinations of the exponents of 2, 3, and 5.

The rectangle can be placed either horizontally or vertically. If placed horizontally, it can cover two adjacent squares in any of the following rows: the first row, the second row, or the third row.

One effective strategy is to guess the squares in such a way that we cover all possible placements of the rectangle.\n\nConsider the following set of squares: the top-left corner, the top-right corner, the middle-left corner, the middle-right corner, the bottom-left corner, and the bottom-right corner. This set of 6 squares includes one square from each possible horizontal placement and one square from each possible vertical placement of the rectangle.

We need to analyze the sign of the expression \\(\\frac{x(2 - x)}{x - 3}\\) in the intervals determined by the roots \\(x = 0\\), \\(x = 2\\), and \\(x = 3\\).\n\nWe can use a sign chart to determine the intervals where the expression is non-negative:\n\n- For \\(x < 0\\), both \\(x\\) and \\(2 - x\\) are negative, so \\(x(2 - x)\\) is positive. Since \\(x - 3\\) is negative, the fraction is negative.\n- For \\(0 < x < 2\\), \\(x\\) is positive and \\(2 - x\\) is positive, so \\(x(2 - x)\\) is positive. Since \\(x - 3\\) is negative, the fraction is negative.\n- For \\(2 < x < 3\\), \\(x\\) is positive and \\(2 - x\\) is negative, so \\(x(2 - x)\\) is negative. Since \\(x - 3\\) is negative, the fraction is positive.\n- For \\(x > 3\\), both \\(x\\) and \\(2 - x\\) are positive, so \\(x(2 - x)\\) is negative. Since \\(x - 3\\) is positive, the fraction is negative.\n\nThus, the expression \\(\\frac{x(2 - x)}{x - 3}\\) is non-negative in the interval \\(2 \\leq x < 3\\). Since \\(x = \\log n\\), we need \\(2 \\leq \\log n < 3\\). Converting this back to \\(n\\), we get:\n\n\\[\n10^2 \\leq n < 10^3 \\implies 100 \\leq n < 1000\n\\]\n\nThe integers \\(n\\) that satisfy this inequality are \\(100, 101, 102, \\ldots, 999\\). To find the number of integers in this range, we calculate:\n\n\\[\n999 - 100 + 1 = 900\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of integers \\(n\\) for which the given expression represents a real number is \\(\\boxed{900}\\)."

Let the least element of \\( B \\) be \\( k \\). Then \\( B \\) must have exactly \\( k \\) elements.\n2. The elements of \\( B \\) must be \\( k, k+1, k+2, \\ldots, k+(k-1) = 2k-1 \\).

Define \\( u = |x| \\) and \\( v = |y| \\). The inequality then becomes:\n\\[ |u - 1| + |v - 1| \\le 1. \\]\n\nThis inequality describes a diamond (or square rotated by 45 degrees) centered at \\((1,1)\\) with a \"side length\" of 2.
