If we have a pair \\((a, b)\\) where \\(a < b\\), then \\(b \\geq 2a\\). We will consider each possible value for \\(a\\) and determine the corresponding possible values for \\(b\\):\n\n- If \\(a = 1\\), then \\(b \\geq 2 \\cdot 1 = 2\\). So, \\(b\\) can be \\(2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14\\). This gives us 13 possible values for \\(b\\).\n- If \\(a = 2\\), then \\(b \\geq 2 \\cdot 2 = 4\\). So, \\(b\\) can be \\(4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14\\). This gives us 11 possible values for \\(b\\).\n- If \\(a = 3\\), then \\(b \\geq 2 \\cdot 3 = 6\\). So, \\(b\\) can be \\(6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14\\). This gives us 9 possible values for \\(b\\).\n- If \\(a = 4\\), then \\(b \\geq 2 \\cdot 4 = 8\\). So, \\(b\\) can be \\(8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14\\). This gives us 7 possible values for \\(b\\).\n- If \\(a = 5\\), then \\(b \\geq 2 \\cdot 5 = 10\\). So, \\(b\\) can be \\(10, 11, 12, 13, 14\\).

This gives us 1 possible value for \\(b\\).\n\nNow, we need to count the number of ways to form these pairs. We can use the principle of counting the number of perfect matchings in a bipartite graph where the vertices on one side are the numbers from 1 to 14 and the vertices on the other side are the numbers from 2 to 14, and an edge exists between \\(i\\) and \\(j\\) if \\(j \\geq 2i\\).\n\nThe number of ways to form these pairs is given by the number of perfect matchings in this bipartite graph, which is the same as the number of ways to partition the set \\(\\{1, 2, \\ldots, 14\\}\\) into 7 pairs such that the condition \\(b \\geq 2a\\) is satisfied.

            "To solve the problem, we start by considering the geometry of the situation. The circle is centered at \\((r, r)\\) with radius \\(r\\), and the line segments connecting points \\((0, a_i)\\) to \\((b_i, 0)\\) are tangent to the circle. The length of each line segment is given by \\(c_i = \\sqrt{a_i^2 + b_i^2}\\).\n\nThe condition for a line to be tangent to a circle is that the perpendicular distance from the center of the circle to the line is equal to the radius of the circle. The equation of the line passing through \\((0, a_i)\\) and \\((b_i, 0)\\) can be written as:\n\\[\n\\frac{x}{b_i} + \\frac{y}{a_i} = 1 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad a_i x + b_i y = a_i b_i.\n\\]\nThe perpendicular distance from the point \\((r, r)\\) to this line is given by:\n\\[\n\\frac{|a_i r + b_i r - a_i b_i|}{\\sqrt{a_i^2 + b_i^2}} = r.\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n|a_i r + b_i r - a_i b_i| = r \\sqrt{a_i^2 + b_i^2}.\n\\]\nSince \\(a_i\\) and \\(b_i\\) are positive integers, we can drop the absolute value and rearrange to get:\n\\[\na_i r + b_i r - a_i b_i = r \\sqrt{a_i^2 + b_i^2}.\n\\]\nDividing through by \\(r\\), we get:\n\\[\na_i + b_i - \\frac{a_i b_i}{r} = \\sqrt{a_i^2 + b_i^2}.\n\\]\nSquaring both sides, we obtain:\n\\[\n(a_i + b_i)^2 - 2a_i b_i \\left(1 + \\frac{a_i b_i}{r}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{a_i b_i}{r}\\right)^2 = a_i^2 + b_i^2.\n\\]\nSimplifying, we get:\n\\[\na_i^2 + 2a_i b_i + b_i^2 - 2a_i b_i - \\frac{2a_i^2 b_i^2}{r} + \\frac{a_i^2 b_i^2}{r^2} = a_i^2 + b_i^2,\n\\]\nwhich reduces to:\n\\[\n2a_i b_i - \\frac{2a_i^2 b_i^2}{r} + \\frac{a_i^2 b_i^2}{r^2} = 0.\n\\]\nMultiplying through by \\(r^2\\), we get:\n\\[\n2a_i b_i r^2 - 2a_i^2 b_i^2 r + a_i^2 b_i^2 = 0.\n\\]\nRearranging terms, we get:\n\\[\n2a_i b_i r^2 = 2a_i^2 b_i^2 r - a_i^2 b_i^2,\n\\]\nor\n\\[\n2r = 2a_i b_i r - a_i b_i,\n\\]\nwhich simplifies to:\n\\[\n2r = a_i b_i (2r - 1).\n\\]\nThus, we have:\n\\[\na_i b_i = \\frac{2r}{2r-1}.\n\\]\nSince \\(a_i\\) and \\(b_i\\) are integers, \\(\\frac{2r}{2r-1}\\) must be an integer. This implies that \\(2r-1\\) must be a divisor of 2. The only positive integer divisors of 2 are 1 and 2. Therefore, \\(2r-1 = 1\\) or \\(2r-1 = 2\\), which gives \\(r = 1\\) or \\(r = \\frac{3}{2}\\). Since \\(r\\) must be an integer, we have \\(r = 1\\).\n\nFor \\(r = 1\\), we have \\(a_i b_i = 2\\). The possible pairs \\((a_i, b_i)\\) are \\((1, 2)\\) and \\((2, 1)\\). The corresponding line segments are:\n\\[\nc_1 = \\sqrt{1^2 + 2^2} = \\sqrt{5}, \\quad c_2 = \\sqrt{2^2 + 1^2} = \\sqrt{5}.\n\\]\nSince we need 14 line segments, we need to find the next smallest integer \\(r\\) such that \\(\\frac{2r}{2r-1}\\) is an integer.

            "To solve for the positive integer \\( n \\) given the conditions, we start by analyzing the least common multiple (LCM) and greatest common divisor (GCD) conditions.\n\nFirst, we know that the LCM of \\( n \\) and 18 is 180. The prime factorizations are:\n\\[ 18 = 2 \\cdot 3^2 \\]\n\\[ 180 = 2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5 \\]\nThe LCM of two numbers is the product of the highest powers of all prime factors present in either number. Therefore, \\( n \\) must include the factor \\( 2^2 \\) (since 18 only has \\( 2^1 \\) and the LCM has \\( 2^2 \\)), the factor \\( 5 \\) (since 18 does not have 5 and the LCM does), and can have at most \\( 3^2 \\) (since 18 already has \\( 3^2 \\)).

The GCD of \\( n \\) and 45 is 15. The prime factorizations are:\n\\[ 45 = 3^2 \\cdot 5 \\]\n\\[ 15 = 3 \\cdot 5 \\]\nThe GCD of two numbers is the product of the lowest powers of all prime factors present in both numbers. Therefore, \\( n \\) must include the factor \\( 3 \\) and \\( 5 \\), and cannot include the factor \\( 2 \\) (since the GCD does not include 2). So, we can write:\n\\[ n = 3^b \\cdot 5 \\cdot m \\]\nwhere \\( b \\geq 1 \\) and \\( m \\) is an integer that does not contain the prime factors 3 or 5.\n\nCombining the two conditions, we see that \\( n \\) must be of the form:\n\\[ n = 2^2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 = 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 = 60 \\]\nWe need to verify that this \\( n \\) satisfies both conditions:\n1.

            "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many children of each type (truth-tellers, alternaters, and liars) there are, and then find out how many of the truth-tellers received candy.\n\nLet's define the variables:\n- \\( T \\) is the number of truth-tellers.\n- \\( A \\) is the number of alternaters.\n- \\( L \\) is the number of liars.\n\nWe know the total number of children is 31, so we have:\n\\[ T + A + L = 31. \\]\n\nNext, we analyze the responses to the three questions:\n\n1. \"Are you a truth-teller?\" The truth-tellers will answer \"Yes,\" the liars will answer \"No,\" and the alternaters will answer \"Yes\" on the first question and \"No\" on the second question, and so on. So, the number of \"Yes\" answers to this question is \\( T + \\frac{A}{2} \\) (since half of the alternaters will answer \"Yes\" and half will answer \"No\").\n\n2. \"Are you an alternater?\" The truth-tellers will answer \"No,\" the liars will answer \"No,\" and the alternaters will answer \"Yes\" on the first question and \"No\" on the second question, and so on.

            "To determine the probability that at least one of the numbers Kayla rolls is greater than 4 and at least two of the numbers she rolls are greater than 2, we will use complementary counting and the principle of inclusion-exclusion.\n\nFirst, let's define the events:\n- \\( A \\): At least one die shows a number greater than 4.\n- \\( B \\): At least two dice show a number greater than 2.\n\nWe need to find \\( P(A \\cap B) \\), the probability that both events \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) occur. We will use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find this probability.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate \\( P(A) \\)\nThe probability that at least one die shows a number greater than 4 is the complement of the probability that all dice show a number 4 or less. The numbers 4, 5, and 6 are the numbers that are 4 or less, so there are 3 such numbers on each die.\n\nThe probability that a single die shows a number 4 or less is:\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\nThe probability that all four dice show a number 4 or less is:\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right)^4 = \\frac{1}{16}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the probability that at least one die shows a number greater than 4 is:\n\\[\nP(A) = 1 - \\frac{1}{16} = \\frac{15}{16}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate \\( P(B) \\)\nThe probability that at least two dice show a number greater than 2 is the complement of the probability that fewer than two dice show a number greater than 2. The numbers greater than 2 are 3, 4, 5, and 6, so there are 4 such numbers on each die.\n\nThe probability that a single die shows a number 2 or less is:\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\nThe probability that all four dice show a number 2 or less is:\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{1}{3} \\right)^4 = \\frac{1}{81}\n\\]\n\nThe probability that exactly one die shows a number greater than 2 is the number of ways to choose 1 die out of 4 to show a number greater than 2, times the probability that this die shows a number greater than 2 and the other three dice show a number 2 or less:\n\\[\n\\binom{4}{1} \\left( \\frac{2}{6} \\right) \\left( \\frac{1}{3} \\right)^3 = 4 \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{1}{27} = \\frac{4}{81}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the probability that fewer than two dice show a number greater than 2 is:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{81} + \\frac{4}{81} = \\frac{5}{81}\n\\]\n\nThe probability that at least two dice show a number greater than 2 is:\n\\[\nP(B) = 1 - \\frac{5}{81} = \\frac{76}{81}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate \\( P(A \\cap B) \\)\nWe use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find \\( P(A \\cap B) \\):\n\\[\nP(A \\cap B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \\cup B)\n\\]\n\nWe already have \\( P(A) \\) and \\( P(B) \\). To find \\( P(A \\cup B) \\), we use the fact that:\n\\[\nP(A \\cup B) = 1 - P(\\text{neither } A \\text{ nor } B)\n\\]\n\nThe event that neither \\( A \\) nor \\( B \\) occurs means that no die shows a number greater than 4 and fewer than two dice show a number greater than 2. This means all dice show a number 2 or less, which we already calculated as:\n\\[\nP(\\text{neither } A \\text{ nor } B) = \\frac{1}{81}\n\\]\n\nTherefore:\n\\[\nP(A \\cup B) = 1 - \\frac{1}{81} = \\frac{80}{81}\n\\]\n\nNow we can find \\( P(A \\cap B) \\):\n\\[\nP(A \\cap B) = \\frac{15}{16} + \\frac{76}{81} - \\frac{80}{81}\n\\]\n\nTo add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 16 and 81 is 1296. Converting each fraction:\n\\[\n\\frac{15}{16} = \\frac{15 \\times 81}{16 \\times 81} = \\frac{1215}{1296}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{76}{81} = \\frac{76 \\times 16}{81 \\times 16} = \\frac{1216}{1296}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{80}{81} = \\frac{80 \\times 16}{81 \\times 16} = \\frac{1280}{1296}\n\\]\n\nNow we can add and subtract:\n\\[\nP(A \\cap B) = \\frac{1215}{1296} + \\frac{1216}{1296} - \\frac{1280}{1296} = \\frac{1215 + 1216 - 1280}{1296} = \\frac{1151}{1296}\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Find the denominator minus the numerator\nThe denominator is 1296 and the numerator is 1151. Therefore, the difference is:\n\\[\n1296 - 1151 = 145\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{145}\n\\]"

            "To determine the area of the region inside both the square and the rectangle, we start by visualizing the given shapes. The rectangle has side lengths 4 and 8, and the square has a side length of 5. The square is positioned such that three of its vertices lie on three different sides of the rectangle.\n\nLet's place the rectangle in the coordinate plane with vertices at \\((0,0)\\), \\((8,0)\\), \\((8,4)\\), and \\((0,4)\\). Assume the square is positioned such that one of its vertices is at \\((x,0)\\) on the bottom side of the rectangle, another vertex is at \\((8,y)\\) on the right side of the rectangle, and the third vertex is at \\((8-x,4)\\) on the top side of the rectangle. The side length of the square is 5, so the distance between \\((x,0)\\) and \\((8,y)\\) is 5, and the distance between \\((8,y)\\) and \\((8-x,4)\\) is also 5.\n\nSince the distance between \\((x,0)\\) and \\((8,y)\\) is 5, we have:\n\\[\n(8-x)^2 + y^2 = 25\n\\]\nAnd since the distance between \\((8,y)\\) and \\((8-x,4)\\) is 5, we have:\n\\[\nx^2 + (4-y)^2 = 25\n\\]\n\nWe can solve these equations simultaneously. First, expand and simplify the second equation:\n\\[\nx^2 + (4-y)^2 = 25 \\implies x^2 + 16 - 8y + y^2 = 25 \\implies x^2 + y^2 - 8y = 9\n\\]\n\nNow we have two equations:\n1. \\((8-x)^2 + y^2 = 25\\)\n2. \\(x^2 + y^2 - 8y = 9\\)\n\nExpand the first equation:\n\\[\n(8-x)^2 + y^2 = 25 \\implies 64 - 16x + x^2 + y^2 = 25 \\implies x^2 + y^2 - 16x = -39\n\\]\n\nWe now have:\n1. \\(x^2 + y^2 - 16x = -39\\)\n2. \\(x^2 + y^2 - 8y = 9\\)\n\nSubtract the second equation from the first:\n\\[\n(x^2 + y^2 - 16x) - (x^2 + y^2 - 8y) = -39 - 9 \\implies -16x + 8y = -48 \\implies 2x - y = 6 \\implies y = 2x - 6\n\\]\n\nSubstitute \\(y = 2x - 6\\) into the second equation:\n\\[\nx^2 + (2x-6)^2 - 8(2x-6) = 9 \\implies x^2 + 4x^2 - 24x + 36 - 16x + 48 = 9 \\implies 5x^2 - 40x + 84 = 9 \\implies 5x^2 - 40x + 75 = 0 \\implies x^2 - 8x + 15 = 0\n\\]\n\nSolve the quadratic equation:\n\\[\nx^2 - 8x + 15 = 0 \\implies (x-3)(x-5) = 0 \\implies x = 3 \\text{ or } x = 5\n\\]\n\nIf \\(x = 3\\), then \\(y = 2(3) - 6 = 0\\), which is not possible since the square would not fit within the rectangle. If \\(x = 5\\), then \\(y = 2(5) - 6 = 4\\), which is possible. So, the vertices of the square are at \\((5,0)\\), \\((8,4)\\), and \\((3,4)\\).\n\nThe area of the region inside both the square and the rectangle is the area of the square minus the area of the part of the square that is outside the rectangle. The part of the square that is outside the rectangle is a right triangle with legs of length 2 and 4. The area of this triangle is:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} \\times 2 \\times 4 = 4\n\\]\n\nSo, the area of the region inside both the square and the rectangle is:\n\\[\n25 - 4 = 21\n\\]\n\nThe numerator of the simplest fraction that represents the area of the region inside both the square and the rectangle is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{21}\n\\]"

Then the equations simplify to:\n\\[ 9s^2 = 2x^2 + 2x^2 - y^2 = 4x^2 - y^2 \\]\n\\[ 9s^2 = 2x^2 + 2y^2 - x^2 = x^2 + 2y^2 \\]\n\nEquating the two expressions for \\(9s^2\\):\n\\[ 4x^2 - y^2 = x^2 + 2y^2 \\]\n\\[ 3x^2 = 3y^2 \\]\n\\[ x^2 = 2y^2 \\]\n\\[ x = y\\sqrt{2} \\]\n\nNow, we use the Law of Cosines in \\(\\triangle ABC\\) to find \\(\\cos(C)\\):\n\\[ AB^2 = AC^2 + BC^2 - 2 \\cdot AC \\cdot BC \\cdot \\cos(C) \\]\n\\[ y^2 = (y\\sqrt{2})^2 + (y\\sqrt{2})^2 - 2 \\cdot y\\sqrt{2} \\cdot y\\sqrt{2} \\cdot \\cos(C) \\]\n\\[ y^2 = 2y^2 + 2y^2 - 4y^2 \\cos(C) \\]\n\\[ y^2 = 4y^2 - 4y^2 \\cos(C) \\]\n\\[ -3y^2 = -4y^2 \\cos(C) \\]\n\\[ \\cos(C) = \\frac{3}{4} \\]\n\nThus, \\(\\cos(C) = \\frac{3\\sqrt{1}}{4}\\), and we have \\(m = 3\\), \\(n = 4\\), and \\(p = 1\\). Therefore, \\(m + n + p = 3 + 4 + 1 = 8\\).\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{8}\n\\]"

            "To solve the problem, we need to understand the structure of a regular icosahedron and the distances between its vertices. A regular icosahedron has 12 vertices, 30 edges, and 20 faces, each of which is an equilateral triangle. The distance \\(d(A, B)\\) between two vertices \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) is the minimum number of edges one must traverse to connect them.\n\nThe possible values for \\(d(A, B)\\) are 1, 2, 3, and 4. Specifically:\n- \\(d(A, B) = 1\\) if \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are adjacent vertices (i.e., they are connected by an edge).\n- \\(d(A, B) = 2\\) if \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are vertices that are not adjacent but are connected by a path of length 2 (i.e., they are connected by two edges).\n- \\(d(A, B) = 3\\) if \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are vertices that are not adjacent and are not connected by a path of length 2 but are connected by a path of length 3.\n- \\(d(A, B) = 4\\) if \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are opposite vertices (i.e., they are connected by a path of length 4).\n\nWe need to find the probability that \\(d(Q, R) > d(R, S)\\) when \\(Q\\), \\(R\\), and \\(S\\) are randomly chosen distinct vertices of the icosahedron. First, we count the number of pairs \\((Q, R)\\) and \\((R, S)\\) for each possible distance.\n\nThe number of ways to choose 3 distinct vertices from 12 is \\(\\binom{12}{3} \\cdot 6 = 220 \\cdot 6 = 1320\\). This is because there are \\(\\binom{12}{3}\\) ways to choose 3 vertices and 6 ways to arrange them into a sequence.\n\nNext, we need to count the number of favorable outcomes where \\(d(Q, R) > d(R, S)\\). We can do this by considering the possible values of \\(d(Q, R)\\) and \\(d(R, S)\\):\n\n1. If \\(d(Q, R) = 1\\), then \\(d(R, S)\\) can be 2, 3, or 4.\n2. If \\(d(Q, R) = 2\\), then \\(d(R, S)\\) can be 3 or 4.\n3. If \\(d(Q, R) = 3\\), then \\(d(R, S)\\) can be 4.\n4. If \\(d(Q, R) = 4\\), then there are no possible values for \\(d(R, S)\\) that are less than 4.\n\nWe need to count the number of ways to choose \\(Q\\), \\(R\\), and \\(S\\) such that \\(d(Q, R) > d(R, S)\\). This is a bit complicated, so we use symmetry and the fact that the icosahedron is regular. By symmetry, the probability that \\(d(Q, R) > d(R, S)\\) is the same as the probability that \\(d(Q, R) < d(R, S)\\), and the probability that \\(d(Q, R) = d(R, S)\\) is the remaining probability. Since the icosahedron is regular, the probability that \\(d(Q, R) > d(R, S)\\) is the same as the probability that \\(d(Q, R) < d(R, S)\\), so each of these probabilities is \\(\\frac{1 - P(d(Q, R) = d(R, S))}{2}\\).\n\nThe probability that \\(d(Q, R) = d(R, S)\\) is the number of ways to choose \\(Q\\), \\(R\\), and \\(S\\) such that \\(d(Q, R) = d(R, S)\\) divided by the total number of ways to choose 3 vertices. By symmetry and the structure of the icosahedron, this probability is \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\).\n\nTherefore, the probability that \\(d(Q, R) > d(R, S)\\) is \\(\\frac{1 - \\frac{1}{3}}{2} = \\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{1}{3}\\).\n\nThe final answer is \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\), so \\(m = 1\\) and \\(n = 3\\), and \\(m + n = 4\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{4}\n\\]"

            "To determine how many dates in 2023 will have each digit appearing an even number of times in the 8-digit display, we need to analyze the structure of the date format, which is YMMDD. Here, Y is the year (2023), MM is the month, and DD is the day. The year 2023 has the digits 2, 0, 2, and 3, so we need to ensure that the month and day together with these digits result in each digit appearing an even number of times in the entire 8-digit number.\n\nFirst, let's list the digits we have: 2, 0, 2, 3. This means we need the month and day to contribute the digits such that each digit (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) appears an even number of times in the entire 8-digit number. Since the digits 2 and 0 are already used in the year, the month and day together must contribute the digits 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9, each appearing an even number of times.\n\nLet's analyze the possible months:\n- January (01) contributes 0 and 1.\n- February (02) contributes 0 and 2.\n- March (03) contributes 0 and 3.\n- April (04) contributes 0 and 4.\n- May (05) contributes 0 and 5.\n- June (06) contributes 0 and 6.\n- July (07) contributes 0 and 7.\n- August (08) contributes 0 and 8.\n- September (09) contributes 0 and 9.\n- October (10) contributes 1 and 0.\n- November (11) contributes 1 and 1.\n- December (12) contributes 1 and 2.\n\nFrom the above, we see that the only months that can contribute the digit 3 are March and September. For the digit 4, the only month is April. For the digit 5, the only month is May. For the digit 6, the only month is June. For the digit 7, the only month is July.

However, we need to check which of these days will contribute the digits 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 an even number of times. The valid days are 04, 05, 06, 07, 08, 09, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, and 31. There are 28 valid days.\n- For September (09), the day can be any number from 01 to 30, but we need the day to contribute the digits 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 0 an even number of times. The valid days are 04, 05, 06, 07, 08, 09, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, and 30.

            "To determine the value of \\( x \\) in Coinland, we need to find the largest amount of money that cannot be formed using the given coin values of 6, 10, and 15 cents. This problem can be approached using the concept of the Frobenius coin problem, which deals with finding the largest number that cannot be expressed as a non-negative integer combination of given coin values.\n\nFirst, we note that the problem is simplified by the fact that the greatest common divisor (gcd) of 6, 10, and 15 is 1. This means that any sufficiently large amount of money can be formed using these coins. We need to find the largest amount that cannot be formed.\n\nWe start by considering the two smallest coin values, 6 and 10, and use the fact that the Frobenius number for two coprime integers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) is given by \\( ab - a - b \\). However, since we have three coin values, we need to check if the addition of the third coin (15 cents) affects the Frobenius number.\n\nWe will use the fact that the Frobenius number for 6 and 10 is \\( 6 \\cdot 10 - 6 - 10 = 50 \\). This means that any amount greater than 50 can be formed using only 6 and 10 cent coins. We need to check if the addition of the 15 cent coin changes this.\n\nWe will check the amounts from 51 to 56 to see if they can be formed using 6, 10, and 15 cent coins:\n- 51: \\( 51 = 3 \\cdot 15 + 6 \\)\n- 52: \\( 52 = 2 \\cdot 15 + 2 \\cdot 10 + 2 \\)\n- 53: \\( 53 = 3 \\cdot 15 + 2 \\cdot 10 + 1 \\)\n- 54: \\( 54 = 9 \\cdot 6 \\)\n- 55: \\( 55 = 3 \\cdot 15 + 5 \\)\n- 56: \\( 56 = 2 \\cdot 15 + 2 \\cdot 10 + 6 \\)\n\nSince all amounts from 51 to 56 can be formed, we need to check the next few amounts to ensure that 50 is indeed the largest amount that cannot be formed. We can use the fact that any amount greater than 50 can be formed using 6 and 10, and adding the 15 cent coin will not change this property for amounts greater than 50.\n\nTherefore, the largest amount that cannot be formed using 6, 10, and 15 cent coins is 41. We can verify this by checking that 41 cannot be formed:\n- 41 is not divisible by 6 or 10, and subtracting 15 from 41 gives 26, which is not divisible by 6 or 10, and so on.\n\nThus, the value of \\( x \\) is 41. The sum of the digits of 41 is \\( 4 + 1 = 5 \\).\n\nThe answer is \\(\\boxed{5}\\)."

Since \\(d\\) must be positive, we have \\(d = 4\\).\n\nThus, the side lengths of the triangle are 6, 10, and 14.

            "To determine the number of nonempty subsets \\( B \\) of the set \\(\\{0, 1, 2, \\ldots, 12\\}\\) such that the number of elements in \\( B \\) is equal to the least element of \\( B \\), we need to consider the following:\n\n1. Let the least element of \\( B \\) be \\( k \\). Then \\( B \\) must have exactly \\( k \\) elements.\n2. The elements of \\( B \\) must be \\( k, k+1, k+2, \\ldots, k+(k-1) = 2k-1 \\).

The set \\(\\{k, k+1, k+2, \\ldots, 2k-1\\}\\) has exactly \\( k \\) elements, so there is exactly one such subset, which is the set itself.\n\nNow, we need to determine the possible values of \\( k \\). The least element \\( k \\) can be any integer from 1 to 12, because if \\( k = 13 \\), the set \\(\\{13, 14, \\ldots, 25\\}\\) would include elements greater than 12, which are not in the original set \\(\\{0, 1, 2, \\ldots, 12\\}\\).\n\nFor each \\( k \\) from 1 to 12, there is exactly one subset \\( B \\) that satisfies the condition. Therefore, the total number of such subsets is the number of possible values of \\( k \\), which is 12.\n\nThus, the number of nonempty subsets \\( B \\) of \\(\\{0, 1, 2, \\ldots, 12\\}\\) that have the property that the number of elements in \\( B \\) is equal to the least element of \\( B \\) is \\(\\boxed{12}\\)."

            "To determine the area of the region defined by the inequality \\( | | x | - 1 | + | | y | - 1 | \\le 1 \\), we need to analyze the expression step by step.\n\nFirst, let's rewrite the inequality in a more manageable form. Define \\( u = |x| \\) and \\( v = |y| \\). The inequality then becomes:\n\\[ |u - 1| + |v - 1| \\le 1. \\]\n\nThis inequality describes a diamond (or square rotated by 45 degrees) centered at \\((1,1)\\) with a \"side length\" of 2. To see this, consider the different cases for the absolute values.\n\n1. **Case 1: \\( u \\ge 1 \\) and \\( v \\ge 1 \\)**\n   \\[ (u - 1) + (v - 1) \\le 1 \\implies u + v \\le 3. \\]\n\n2. **Case 2: \\( u \\ge 1 \\) and \\( v < 1 \\)**\n   \\[ (u - 1) + (1 - v) \\le 1 \\implies u - v \\le 1. \\]\n\n3. **Case 3: \\( u < 1 \\) and \\( v \\ge 1 \\)**\n   \\[ (1 - u) + (v - 1) \\le 1 \\implies -u + v \\le 1 \\implies v - u \\le 1. \\]\n\n4. **Case 4: \\( u < 1 \\) and \\( v < 1 \\)**\n   \\[ (1 - u) + (1 - v) \\le 1 \\implies -u - v \\le -1 \\implies u + v \\ge 1. \\]\n\nCombining these cases, we see that the region described by \\( |u - 1| + |v - 1| \\le 1 \\) is a square with vertices at \\((2,1)\\), \\((1,2)\\), \\((0,1)\\), and \\((1,0)\\).\n\nNow, we need to translate this back to the original variables \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). Since \\(u = |x|\\) and \\(v = |y|\\), the vertices \\((2,1)\\), \\((1,2)\\), \\((0,1)\\), and \\((1,0)\\) correspond to the points \\((2,1)\\), \\((1,2)\\), \\((-2,1)\\), and \\((1,-2)\\) in the \\(xy\\)-plane. This describes a square centered at the origin with side length 2\\(\\sqrt{2}\\).\n\nThe area of a square is given by the side length squared. Here, the side length is 2\\(\\sqrt{2}\\), so the area is:\n\\[ (2\\sqrt{2})^2 = 8. \\]\n\nThus, the area of the region is \\(\\boxed{8}\\)."
