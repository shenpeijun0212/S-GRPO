We assume:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{(s+a)(s+b)} = \\frac{A}{s+a} + \\frac{B}{s+b}\n   \\]\n   where \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) are constants to be determined.\n\n2. **Combine the Fractions:**\n   Combine the right-hand side over a common denominator:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{A}{s+a} + \\frac{B}{s+b} = \\frac{A(s+b) + B(s+a)}{(s+a)(s+b)}\n   \\]\n   Simplify the numerator:\n   \\[\n   A(s+b) + B(s+a) = As + Ab + Bs + Ba = (A+B)s + (Ab + Ba)\n   \\]\n   So, we have:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{(s+a)(s+b)} = \\frac{(A+B)s + (Ab + Ba)}{(s+a)(s+b)}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Equate the Numerators:**\n   Since the denominators are the same, we equate the numerators:\n   \\[\n   1 = (A+B)s + (Ab + Ba)\n   \\]\n   This gives us a system of equations by comparing coefficients:\n   \\[\n   A + B = 0\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   Ab + Ba = 1\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solve the System of Equations:**\n   From \\( A + B = 0 \\), we get:\n   \\[\n   B = -A\n   \\]\n   Substitute \\( B = -A \\) into the second equation:\n   \\[\n   A(-a) + (-A)b = 1\n   \\]\n   Simplify:\n   \\[\n   -Aa - Ab = 1\n   \\]\n   Factor out \\( -A \\):\n   \\[\n   -A(a + b) = 1\n   \\]\n   Solve for \\( A \\):\n   \\[\n   A = -\\frac{1}{a+b}\n   \\]\n   Then, using \\( B = -A \\):\n   \\[\n   B = \\frac{1}{a+b}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Substitute \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) Back:**\n   Substitute \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) back into the partial fractions:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{(s+a)(s+b)} = \\frac{-\\frac{1}{a+b}}{s+a} + \\frac{\\frac{1}{a+b}}{s+b}\n   \\]\n   Simplify:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{(s+a)(s+b)} = \\frac{1}{a+b} \\left( \\frac{1}{s+b} - \\frac{1}{s+a} \\right)\n   \\]\n\n6. **Inverse Laplace Transform:**\n   Now, we find the inverse Laplace transform of each term:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{L}^{-1} \\left\\{ \\frac{1}{a+b} \\left( \\frac{1}{s+b} - \\frac{1}{s+a} \\right) \\right\\}\n   \\]\n   Using the linearity property of the inverse Laplace transform:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{L}^{-1} \\left\\{ \\frac{1}{a+b} \\left( \\frac{1}{s+b} - \\frac{1}{s+a} \\right) \\right\\} = \\frac{1}{a+b} \\left( \\mathcal{L}^{-1} \\left\\{ \\frac{1}{s+b} \\right\\} - \\mathcal{L}^{-1} \\left\\{ \\frac{1}{s+a} \\right\\} \\right)\n   \\]\n   The inverse Laplace transforms are:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{L}^{-1} \\left\\{ \\frac{1}{s+b} \\right\\} = e^{-bt}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{L}^{-1} \\left\\{ \\frac{1}{s+a} \\right\\} = e^{-at}\n   \\]\n   Therefore:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{L}^{-1} \\left\\{ \\frac{1}{a+b} \\left( \\frac{1}{s+b} - \\frac{1}{s+a} \\right) \\right\\} = \\frac{1}{a+b} \\left( e^{-bt} - e^{-at} \\right)\n   \\]\n\n7. **Final Answer:**\n   The inverse Laplace transform of \\( Y(s) = \\frac{1}{(s+a)(s+b)} \\) is:\n   \\[\n   y(t) = \\frac{e^{-bt} - e^{-at}}{a+b}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{e^{-bt} - e^{-at}}{a+b}}\n\\]"

            "To solve the problem, we need to understand the relationship between the speed of the baseball player and the angle he sees from third base. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Geometry\nThe player starts at home plate and runs towards first base. As he runs, he sees third base at an angle of \\(45^\\circ\\) to his left. This means that the player's path and the line from his current position to third base form a \\(45^\\circ\\) angle.\n\n### Step 2: Using the Relativity Formula\nThe speed of the baseball player is given by \\(\\beta = \\frac{v}{c}\\), where \\(v\\) is the speed of the player and \\(c\\) is the speed of light. The angle \\(\\theta\\) that the player sees from third base is related to the speed by the following formula:\n\\[\n\\cos \\theta = \\frac{1 - \\beta^2}{1 + \\beta^2}\n\\]\nGiven that \\(\\theta = 45^\\circ\\), we have \\(\\cos 45^\\circ = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\). Substituting this into the formula, we get:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{1 - \\beta^2}{1 + \\beta^2}\n\\]\nTo solve for \\(\\beta\\), we can cross-multiply:\n\\[\n1 + \\beta^2 = \\sqrt{2}(1 - \\beta^2)\n\\]\nExpanding and rearranging terms, we get:\n\\[\n1 + \\beta^2 = \\sqrt{2} - \\sqrt{2}\\beta^2\n\\]\n\\[\n1 + \\beta^2 + \\sqrt{2}\\beta^2 = \\sqrt{2}\n\\]\n\\[\n1 + (1 + \\sqrt{2})\\beta^2 = \\sqrt{2}\n\\]\n\\[\n(1 + \\sqrt{2})\\beta^2 = \\sqrt{2} - 1\n\\]\n\\[\n\\beta^2 = \\frac{\\sqrt{2} - 1}{1 + \\sqrt{2}}\n\\]\nTo simplify the right-hand side, we multiply the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator:\n\\[\n\\beta^2 = \\frac{(\\sqrt{2} - 1)(1 - \\sqrt{2})}{(1 + \\sqrt{2})(1 - \\sqrt{2})} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2} - 2 - 1 + \\sqrt{2}}{1 - 2} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{2} - 3}{-1} = 3 - 2\\sqrt{2}\n\\]\nHowever, we can see that the correct simplification should be:\n\\[\n\\beta^2 = \\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\nThus, \\(\\beta = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\).\n\n### Step 3: Determining the Wavelength\nThe wavelength of light as seen by the player is given by the Lorentz transformation for the frequency of light. The frequency of light as seen by the player is given by:\n\\[\nf' = f \\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}\n\\]\nwhere \\(f\\) is the frequency of the light as seen by an observer at rest. The wavelength \\(\\lambda'\\) is related to the frequency by:\n\\[\n\\lambda' = \\frac{c}{f'}\n\\]\nSubstituting \\(f' = f \\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}\\), we get:\n\\[\n\\lambda' = \\frac{c}{f \\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}} = \\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{red}}}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}}\n\\]\nSince \\(\\beta = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\), we have:\n\\[\n1 - \\beta^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\nThus:\n\\[\n\\lambda' = \\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{red}}}{\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}}} = \\lambda_{\\text{red}} \\sqrt{2}\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThe wavelength that Manny sees is \\(\\boxed{\\lambda_{\\text{red}} \\sqrt{2}}\\)."

The speed of light \\(c\\) is approximately \\(299,792,458\\) meters per second, and \\(1\\) eV is approximately \\(1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}\\) amu.\n\n   Therefore, the mass equivalent of the energy required to remove an electron is:\n   \\[\n   m = \\frac{E}{c^2} = \\frac{24.59118 \\text{ eV}}{(299,792,458 \\text{ m\/s})^2} \\times \\frac{1 \\text{ amu}}{1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ eV}}\n   \\]\n   Simplifying this, we get:\n   \\[\n   m \\approx 0.0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000"

However, without specific information about the nature of argillic, we can assume it is a strong base, such as sodiumargillic (NaA).\n\n2. **Determine the charge of the salt**: A strong base like sodiumargillic (NaA) is a salt of a strong base (sodium hydroxide, NaOH) and a strong acid (argon, Ar). When NaA is added to water, it dissociates into Na+ and A- ions. The A- ion is the conjugate base of the weak acid argon, and it will hydrolyze in water to produce OH- ions. The net effect is that the solution will have a net negative charge because the OH- ions are produced.\n\n3. **Calculate the net charge**: The net charge of the solution will be determined by the charge of the ions present. In the case of NaA, the solution will have a net negative charge because the A- ions (which are negative) will be in excess compared to the positive charge from the Na+ ions.\n\nTherefore, the net charge of argillic in a solution of pH 1.0 is \\(\\boxed{-n}\\)."

            "To determine the band gap \\( E_g \\) for the given material, we need to consider the properties of the material and the characteristics of the band gap in sem conductors.\n\n1. **Identify the type of material**: The problem states that the material is pure and appears red in transmitted light. This indicates that the material is a conductor because it allows light to pass through with minimal reflection, which is characteristic of conductors. However, the problem also mentions that the material is a semConductor, which suggests there might be a misunderstanding in the initial interpretation. Let's clarify this by considering the band gap.\n\n2. ** band gap in sem conductors**: In sem conductors, the band gap is the energy difference between the top of the valence band and the bottom of the conduction band. This energy difference determines the material's ability to conduct electricity. For a material to be a semConductor, the band gap must be finite, meaning there is a range of energy levels that can be occupied by chargecarries ( either holes in the valence band or electrons in the conduction band).\n\n3. ** approximate band gap**: The band gap for a typical semConductor like a pure integer material (without specific details) can vary, but a common value for many sem conductors is around 1.1 to 2.8 eV. Given the problem's context and the need for an approximate value, we can take the midpoint of this range as a reasonable estimate. The midpoint of 1.1 eV and 2.8 eV is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1.1 + 2.8}{2} = \\frac{3.9}{2} = 1.95 \\text{ eV}\n\\]\n\nRounding 1.95 eV to one decimal place, we get 2.0 eV.\n\nTherefore, the approximate band gap \\( E_g \\) for this material is \\(\\boxed{2.0}\\) eV."

            "To determine the wavelength of the photoemission generated by the interaction of the EM radiation with the Germanium crystal, we can use the relationship between the frequency of the EM radiation, the work function of the material, and the wavelength of the photoemission. The relationship is given by the equation:\n\n\\[ E = \\frac{c}{\\lambda} \\]\n\nwhere \\( E \\) is the energy of the EM radian, \\( c \\) is the speed of light, and \\( \\lambda \\) is the wavelength of the EM radian. The energy of the EM radian can also be expressed in terms of its frequency as:\n\n\\[ E = h \\cdot f \\]\n\nwhere \\( h \\) is Planck's constant and \\( f \\) is the frequency of the EM radian. By equating the two expressions for energy, we get:\n\n\\[ h \\cdot f = \\frac{c}{\\lambda} \\]\n\nRearranging this equation to solve for the wavelength \\( \\lambda \\), we get:\n\n\\[ \\lambda = \\frac{c}{h \\cdot f} \\]\n\nWe are given the frequency \\( f = 3.091 \\times 10^{14} \\) Hz, Planck's constant \\( h = 6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\) J\u00b7s, and the speed of light \\( c = 3.00 \\times 10^8 \\) m\/s.

Let's recheck the calculation of the energy in eV. The band gap of Germanium is 0.7 eV, which means the work function of Germanium is 0.7 eV. The energy of the EM radian in eV is:\n\n\\[ E = 3.091 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ Hz} \\cdot 6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J\u00b7s} \/ 1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ J\/eV} = 1.28 \\text{ eV} \\]\n\nThe energy of the EM radian is greater than the band gap of Germanium, so photoemission will occur. The wavelength of the photoemission is given by:\n\n\\[ \\lambda = \\frac{1.28 \\text{ eV}}{1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ J\/eV} \\cdot 3.00 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m\/s}} = 2.60 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m} \\]\n\nSo, the wavelength of the photoemission is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2.60 \\times 10^{-7}} \\]"

            "To determine the linear density of atoms along the \\( <110> \\) direction in barium (Ba), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the direction vector**: The direction vector \\( <110> \\) indicates that for every 1 unit of length along the x-axis, there is 1 unit of length along the y-axis, and 0 units of length along the z-axis.\n\n2. **Calculate the magnitude of the direction vector**: The magnitude of the direction vector \\( <110> \\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2 + 0^2} = \\sqrt{2}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the number of atoms per unit length**: The linear density of atoms along a direction is the number of atoms per unit length in that direction.

            "To determine the energy of a photon with a wavelength of 800 nm in units of eV, we can use the relationship between the energy of a photon, its wavelength, and Planck's constant.

            "To determine how many different [110]-type directions lie in the (111) plane in an cubic unit cell (U cell), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the [110] directions in the cubic unit cell:**\n   The [110] directions are the directions along the lines where the indices (1,1,0) are constant. In a cubic unit cell, these directions are along the body diagonals and the face diagonals. Specifically, the [110] directions are:\n   - (1,1,0)\n   - (1,0,1)\n   - (0,1,1)\n   - (-1,-1,0)\n   - (-1,0,-1)\n   - (0,-1,-1)\n\n2. **Determine which of these directions lie in the (111) plane:**\n   The (111) plane is defined by the equation \\(x + y + z = 0\\) in the cubic unit cell. We need to check which of the [110] directions satisfy this equation.\n   - For (1,1,0): \\(1 + 1 + 0 = 2 \\neq 0\\)\n   - For (1,0,1): \\(1 + 0 + 1 = 2 \\neq 0\\)\n   - For (0,1,1): \\(0 + 1 + 1 = 2 \\neq 0\\)\n   - For (-1,-1,0): \\(-1 - 1 + 0 = -2 \\neq 0\\)\n   - For (-1,0,-1): \\(-1 + 0 - 1 = -2 \\neq 0\\)\n   - For (0,-1,-1): \\(0 - 1 - 1 = -2 \\neq 0\\)\n\n   None of the [110] directions listed above satisfy the equation of the (111) plane. However, we need to consider the possibility of the [110] directions being in the plane in a different way. The [110] directions can be represented as vectors, and we need to check if these vectors are perpendicular to the normal vector of the (111) plane, which is (1,1,1).\n\n   The dot product of (1,1,0) with (1,1,1) is \\(1 \\cdot 1 + 1 \\cdot 1 + 0 \\cdot 1 = 2 \\neq 0\\), so (1,1,0) is not perpendicular to (1,1,1). Similarly, we can check the other [110] directions and find that none of them are perpendicular to (1,1,1).\n\n   However, we need to consider the possibility of the [110] directions being in the plane in a different way. The [110] directions can be represented as vectors, and we need to check if these vectors are perpendicular to the normal vector of the (111) plane, which is (1,1,1).\n\n   The correct approach is to consider the symmetry and the fact that the (111) plane is symmetric and contains the [110] directions in a specific way. The correct answer is that there are exactly 3 different [110] directions that lie in the (111) plane.\n\nTherefore, the number of different [110]-type directions that lie in the (111) plane is \\(\\boxed{3}\\)."

            "To calculate the planar packing fraction of the (110) plane for aluminum at 300 K, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the lattice parameter of aluminum.\n2. Determine the number of atoms in the (110) plane.\n3. Determine the area of the (110) plane.\n4. Determine the area occupied by the atoms in the (110) plane.\n5. Calculate the planar packing fraction.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the lattice parameter of aluminum\nThe lattice parameter of aluminum (Al) is approximately \\( a = 4.04 \\) Angstrons.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the number of atoms in the (110) plane\nThe (110) plane in a cubic lattice of aluminum contains 2 atoms. This is because the plane intersects the lattice along two lattice planes along the [110] direction.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the area of the (110) plane\nThe area of the (110) plane is the area of a rectangle with sides equal to the lattice parameter \\( a \\) and the distance between the planes, which is also \\( a \\). Therefore, the area of the (110) plane is:\n\\[ A = a \\times a = a^2 = (4.04 \\text{ Angstrons})^2 = 16.3216 \\text{ square Angstrons} \\]\n\n### Step 4: Determine the area occupied by the atoms in the (110) plane\nEach atom in the (110) plane is a sphere with a diameter equal to the lattice parameter \\( a \\), so the radius of each atom is \\( \\frac{a}{2} \\). The area occupied by one atom is the area of a circle with radius \\( \\frac{a}{2} \\):\n\\[ \\text{Area of one atom} = \\pi \\left( \\frac{a}{2} \\right)^2 = \\pi \\left( \\frac{4.04}{2} \\right)^2 = \\pi (2.02)^2 = 12.7324 \\pi \\text{ square Angstrons} \\]\nSince there are 2 atoms in the (110) plane, the total area occupied by the atoms is:\n\\[ \\text{Total area occupied by atoms} = 2 \\times 12.7324 \\pi = 25.4648 \\pi \\text{ square Angstrons} \\]\nUsing \\( \\pi \\approx 3.14159 \\), we get:\n\\[ \\text{Total area occupied by atoms} \\approx 25.4648 \\times 3.14159 = 80.000 \\text{ square Angstrons} \\]\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the planar packing fraction\nThe planar packing fraction is the ratio of the area occupied by the atoms to the area of the (110) plane:\n\\[ \\text{Planar packing fraction} = \\frac{\\text{Total area occupied by atoms}}{\\text{Area of the (110) plane}} = \\frac{80.000}{16.3216} \\approx 0.490 \\]\n\nTherefore, the planar packing fraction of the (110) plane for aluminum at 300 K is:\n\\[ \\boxed{0.490} \\]"

The area \\(A\\) of an equilateral triangle with side length \\(a\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   A = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} a^2\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the number of atoms on the (111) plane:**\n   The (111) plane intersects the cubic lattice at 3 atoms. This is because the plane passes through the vertices of the unit cell along the [111] direction.\n\n4. **Calculate the planar packing density:**\n   The planar packing density is the number of atoms per unit area. Since the area of the (111) plane is \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} a^2\\) and it contains 3 atoms, the planar packing density \\(D\\) is:\n   \\[\n   D = \\frac{3}{\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} a^2} = \\frac{12}{\\sqrt{3} a^2} = \\frac{12 \\sqrt{3}}{3 a^2} = \\frac{4 \\sqrt{3}}{a^2}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Substitute the lattice constant \\(a\\):**\n   The lattice constant \\(a\\) is given as \\(0.77 \\text{ Angstrons}\\). Therefore, the planar packing density is:\n   \\[\n   D = \\frac{4 \\sqrt{3}}{(0.77)^2} = \\frac{4 \\sqrt{3}}{0.5929} \\approx \\frac{4 \\times 1.732}{0.5929} \\approx \\frac{6.928}{0.5929} \\approx 11.69\n   \\]\n\n6. **Express the answer in the required format:**\n   The planar packing density is \\(11.69 \\text{ atoms\/m}^2\\).

        "output":[
            "To determine the algebraic condition that describes a firm that is at an output level that maximizes its profits given its capital in the short-term, we need to use some basic principles from microeconmetry, particularly the concept of profit maximization.\n\n1. **Define the profit function**: The profit function for a firm is given by the difference between its total revenue (TR) and its total cost (TC). If we denote the output level by \\( Q \\), the profit function can be written as:\n   \\[\n   \\pi(Q) = TR(Q) - TC(Q)\n   \\]\n   where \\( TR(Q) \\) is the total revenue as a function of output \\( Q \\), and \\( TC(Q) \\) is the total cost as a function of output \\( Q \\).\n\n2. **First-order condition for profit maximization**: To find the output level that maximizes profit, we need to take the derivative of the profit function with respect to \\( Q \\) and set it equal to zero. This is because at the profit\u6700\u5927\u5316 output level, the slope of the profit function (which is the derivative of profit with respect to output) is zero. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d\\pi(Q)}{dQ} = \\frac{dTR(Q)}{dQ} - \\frac{dTC(Q)}{dQ} = 0\n   \\]\n   The derivative of total revenue with respect to output is the price (since price is the slope of the total revenue curve), and the derivative of total cost with respect to output is the marginal cost. Therefore, the first-order condition for profit maximization can be written as:\n   \\[\n   P(Q) - MC(Q) = 0\n   \\]\n   where \\( P(Q) \\) is the price as a function of output \\( Q \\), and \\( MC(Q) \\) is the marginal cost as a function of output \\( Q \\).\n\n3. **AC and MC relationship**: In the short-run, a firm's price is typically determined by the market and is not affected by the firm's output level. Therefore, the condition for profit maximization can be rewritten in terms of the average cost (AC) and the marginal cost (MC) curves. The average cost is the total cost divided by the output level, and the marginal cost is the additional cost of producing one more unit of output. At the profit\u6700\u5927\u5316 output level, the price (which is the same as the marginal revenue in a perfectly price discriminant market) is equal to the marginal cost. This can be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   AC(Q) = MC(Q)\n   \\]\n   This condition states that the average cost of producing an additional unit of output is equal to the additional revenue from producing that unit.\n\nTherefore, the algebraic condition that describes a firm that is at an output level that maximizes its profits, given its capital in the short-term, is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{P = MC}\n\\]"

            "To determine the conditions that describe a firm that is at a capital level that minimizes its costs in the long-term, we need to consider both the short-run and long-run average cost curves. Let's break down the problems step by step.\n\n### Subproblem 0: Short- run Average Cost (SRAC) Condition\n\nThe condition that involves the Short- run Average Cost (SRAC) is that the Short- run Average Cost (SRAC) equals the Long- run Average Cost (LRAC). This condition is expressed as:\n\n\\[ \\text{SRAC} = \\text{LRAC} \\]\n\nThis means that in the long-run, the average cost of production is minimized when the short-run average cost is equal to the long-run average cost. This is because in the long-run, the firm can adjust all its factors of production, including its capital, to minimize the average cost of production.\n\n### Subproblem 1: Short- run Marginal Cost (SRMC) Condition\n\nThe condition that involves the Short- run Marginal Cost (SRMC) is that the Short- run Marginal Cost (SRMC) equals the Short- run Average Cost (SRAC). This condition is expressed as:\n\n\\[ \\text{SRMC} = \\text{SRAC} \\]\n\nThis means that in the short-run, the firm should produce at a level where the additional cost of producing one more unit of output (marginal cost) is equal to the average cost of producing that unit of output. This is because if the marginal cost is less than the average cost, the average cost can be reduced by producing more units, and if the marginal cost is greater than the average cost, the average cost can be reduced by producing fewer units.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe final answer, combining both conditions, is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{SRAC} = \\text{LRAC} \\text{ and } \\text{SRMC} = \\text{SRAC}} \\]\n\nThis means that in the long-run, the average cost is minimized when the short-run average cost equals the long-run average cost, and in the short-run, the average cost can be minimized by producing at a level where the marginal cost equals the average cost."

Therefore, we need to normalize the wavefunction \\(\\psi_{1,2}\\) by dividing each coefficient by the square root of the sum of the squares of the coefficients:\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{1}{3^{1\/2}} \\right)^2 + \\left( \\frac{2}{3^{1\/2}} \\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{4}{3} = \\frac{5}{3}\n\\]\nSo, the normalized coefficients are:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\frac{1}{3^{1\/2}}}{\\sqrt{\\frac{5}{3}}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}}, \\quad \\frac{\\frac{2}{3^{1\/2}}}{\\sqrt{\\frac{5}{3}}} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{5}}\n\\]\nThus, the normalized wavefunction is:\n\\[\n\\psi_{1,2} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}} \\psi_1 + \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{5}} \\psi_2\n\\]\nThe probability of measuring \\(E_1\\) is now:\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}} \\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{5}\n\\]\nThe probability of measuring \\(E_2\\) is now:\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{5}} \\right)^2 = \\frac{4}{5}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the possible results of the measurement are \\(E_1\\) and \\(E_2\\).\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{E_1, E_2}\n\\]"
