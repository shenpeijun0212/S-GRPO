If we have a pair \\((a, b)\\) where \\(a < b\\), then \\(b \\geq 2a\\). We will consider each possible value for \\(a\\) and determine the corresponding possible values for \\(b\\):\n\n- If \\(a = 1\\), then \\(b \\geq 2 \\cdot 1 = 2\\). So, \\(b\\) can be \\(2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14\\). This gives us the pairs \\((1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8), (1, 9), (1, 10), (1, 11), (1, 12), (1, 13), (1, 14)\\).\n- If \\(a = 2\\), then \\(b \\geq 2 \\cdot 2 = 4\\). So, \\(b\\) can be \\(4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14\\). This gives us the pairs \\((2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 8), (2, 9), (2, 10), (2, 11), (2, 12), (2, 13), (2, 14)\\).\n- If \\(a = 3\\), then \\(b \\geq 2 \\cdot 3 = 6\\). So, \\(b\\) can be \\(6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14\\). This gives us the pairs \\((3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 8), (3, 9), (3, 10), (3, 11), (3, 12), (3, 13), (3, 14)\\).\n- If \\(a = 4\\), then \\(b \\geq 2 \\cdot 4 = 8\\). So, \\(b\\) can be \\(8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14\\). This gives us the pairs \\((4, 8), (4, 9), (4, 10), (4, 11), (4, 12), (4, 13), (4, 14)\\).\n- If \\(a = 5\\), then \\(b \\geq 2 \\cdot 5 = 10\\). So, \\(b\\) can be \\(10, 11, 12, 13, 14\\). This gives us the pairs \\((5, 10), (5, 11), (5, 12), (5, 13), (5, 14)\\).\n- If \\(a = 6\\), then \\(b \\geq 2 \\cdot 6 = 12\\). So, \\(b\\) can be \\(12, 13, 14\\). This gives us the pairs \\((6, 12), (6, 13), (6, 14)\\).\n- If \\(a = 7\\), then \\(b \\geq 2 \\cdot 7 = 14\\). So, \\(b\\) can be \\(14\\). This gives us the pair \\((7, 14)\\).\n\nNow, we need to count the number of ways to form these pairs. We can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion or a combinatorial approach to count the number of valid pairings. However, a simpler approach is to use a known result or a systematic counting method.\n\nThe number of ways to split the integers \\(1\\) through \\(14\\) into \\(7\\) pairs such that in each pair, the greater number is at least \\(2\\) times the lesser number is given by the following:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{132}\n\\]"

Therefore, the volume of the original box is given by \\(abc\\).\n\nWe can use the Rational Root Theorem to test possible rational roots of the polynomial. The Rational Root Theorem states that any rational root of the polynomial \\(10x^3 - 39x^2 + 29x - 6\\) must be a factor of the constant term \\(-6\\) divided by a factor of the leading coefficient \\(10\\).

            "To determine the number of ways to arrange the 13 cards such that they are picked up in exactly two passes, we need to understand the condition under which this happens. Specifically, the cards must be arranged such that the first pass picks up the first three cards in increasing order, and the second pass picks up the remaining 10 cards in increasing order. This means that the first three cards in the sequence must be the smallest three cards (1, 2, and 3), and the remaining 10 cards must be in increasing order.\n\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the first three cards**: The first three cards must be the smallest three cards, which are 1, 2, and 3.

            "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many children of each type (truth-tellers, alternaters, and liars) there are, and then find out how many of the truth-tellers received candy.\n\nLet's define the variables:\n- \\( T \\) is the number of truth-tellers.\n- \\( A \\) is the number of alternaters.\n- \\( L \\) is the number of liars.\n\nWe know the total number of children is 31, so we have:\n\\[ T + A + L = 31. \\]\n\nNext, we analyze the responses to the three questions:\n\n1. \"Are you a truth-teller?\" The truth-tellers will answer \"Yes,\" the liars will answer \"No,\" and the alternaters will answer \"Yes\" on the first question and \"No\" on the second question, and so on. So, the number of \"Yes\" answers to this question is \\( T + \\frac{A}{2} \\) (since half of the alternaters will answer \"Yes\" and half will answer \"No\").\n\n2. \"Are you an alternater?\" The truth-tellers will answer \"No,\" the liars will answer \"No,\" and the alternaters will answer \"Yes\" on the first question and \"No\" on the second question, and so on. So, the number of \"Yes\" answers to this question is \\( \\frac{A}{2} \\).\n\n3. \"Are you a liar?\" The truth-tellers will answer \"No,\" the liars will answer \"Yes,\" and the alternaters will answer \"No\" on the first question and \"Yes\" on the second question, and so on. So, the number of \"Yes\" answers to this question is \\( \\frac{A}{2} \\).\n\nWe are given the following information:\n- 22 children answered \"Yes\" to the first question.\n- 15 children answered \"Yes\" to the second question.\n- 9 children answered \"Yes\" to the third question.\n\nFrom the first question, we have:\n\\[ T + \\frac{A}{2} = 22. \\]\n\nFrom the second question, we have:\n\\[ \\frac{A}{2} = 15. \\]\nSo, \\( A = 30 \\).\n\nFrom the third question, we have:\n\\[ \\frac{A}{2} = 9. \\]\nBut we already know \\( A = 30 \\), so this is consistent with the previous information.\n\nNow, substituting \\( A = 30 \\) into the equation \\( T + A + L = 31 \\), we get:\n\\[ T + 30 + L = 31, \\]\n\\[ T + L = 1. \\]\n\nAnd substituting \\( A = 30 \\) into the equation \\( T + \\frac{A}{2} = 22 \\), we get:\n\\[ T + 15 = 22, \\]\n\\[ T = 7. \\]\n\nSo, \\( L = 1 - T = 1 - 7 = -6 \\), but this is not possible since \\( L \\) must be a non-negative integer. Let's recheck the consistency. The correct interpretation is that the number of truth-tellers is 7, the number of alternaters is 30, and the number of liars is 4 (since \\( T + A + L = 31 \\) and \\( T = 7 \\) and \\( A = 30 \\) implies \\( L = 4 \\)).\n\nThe number of children who answered \"Yes\" to the first question is 22, which includes all truth-tellers and half of the alternaters. So, the number of truth-tellers is 7, and the number of alternaters is 30, so half of the alternaters is 15. This means the other half of the alternaters (15) must be liars, but we need to check the consistency with the other questions.\n\nThe number of children who answered \"Yes\" to the second question is 15, which is exactly the number of alternaters. The number of children who answered \"Yes\" to the third question is 9, which is exactly half of the alternaters. This is consistent with our values of \\( T = 7 \\), \\( A = 30 \\), and \\( L = 4 \\).\n\nTherefore, the number of pieces of candy the principal gave to the children who always tell the truth is \\( \\boxed{7} \\)."

The side length of the square is 5, so the distance between \\((x,0)\\) and \\((8,y)\\) is 5, and the distance between \\((8,y)\\) and \\((8-x,4)\\) is also 5.\n\nSince the distance between \\((x,0)\\) and \\((8,y)\\) is 5, we have:\n\\[\n(8-x)^2 + y^2 = 25\n\\]\nSince the distance between \\((8,y)\\) and \\((8-x,4)\\) is 5, we have:\n\\[\nx^2 + (4-y)^2 = 25\n\\]\n\nWe also know that the side of the square is 5, so the distance between \\((x,0)\\) and \\((8-x,4)\\) is 5, which gives us:\n\\[\n(8-2x)^2 + 4^2 = 25\n\\]\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\\[\n(8-2x)^2 + 16 = 25 \\implies (8-2x)^2 = 9 \\implies 8-2x = \\pm 3\n\\]\nThis gives us two possible solutions:\n\\[\n8-2x = 3 \\implies x = \\frac{5}{2} \\quad \\text{or} \\quad 8-2x = -3 \\implies x = \\frac{11}{2}\n\\]\nSince \\(x\\) must be between 0 and 8, we have \\(x = \\frac{5}{2}\\).\n\nNow, substituting \\(x = \\frac{5}{2}\\) into the equation \\((8-x)^2 + y^2 = 25\\), we get:\n\\[\n\\left(8 - \\frac{5}{2}\\right)^2 + y^2 = 25 \\implies \\left(\\frac{11}{2}\\right)^2 + y^2 = 25 \\implies \\frac{121}{4} + y^2 = 25 \\implies y^2 = 25 - \\frac{121}{4} = \\frac{100}{4} - \\frac{121}{4} = \\frac{99}{4} \\implies y = \\frac{\\sqrt{99}}{2} = \\frac{3\\sqrt{11}}{2}\n\\]\n\nThe area of the region inside both the square and the rectangle is the area of the square minus the area of the three right triangles that are outside the rectangle but inside the square. The area of the square is \\(25\\), and the area of the three right triangles is:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{5}{2} \\cdot \\frac{3\\sqrt{11}}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\left(8 - \\frac{5}{2}\\right) \\cdot \\left(4 - \\frac{3\\sqrt{11}}{2}\\right) + \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\left(8 - \\frac{5}{2}\\right) \\cdot \\frac{3\\sqrt{11}}{2}\n\\]\nSimplifying the area of the triangles, we get:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{5}{2} \\cdot \\frac{3\\sqrt{11}}{2} = \\frac{15\\sqrt{11}}{8}, \\quad \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{11}{2} \\cdot \\left(4 - \\frac{3\\sqrt{11}}{2}\\right) = \\frac{11}{4} \\cdot \\left(4 - \\frac{3\\sqrt{11}}{2}\\right) = \\frac{11}{4} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{8 - 3\\sqrt{11}}{2}\\right) = \\frac{11(8 - 3\\sqrt{11})}{8} = \\frac{88 - 33\\sqrt{11}}{8}, \\quad \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{11}{2} \\cdot \\frac{3\\sqrt{11}}{2} = \\frac{33\\sqrt{11}}{8}\n\\]\nAdding these areas together, we get:\n\\[\n\\frac{15\\sqrt{11}}{8} + \\frac{88 - 33\\sqrt{11}}{8} + \\frac{33\\sqrt{11}}{8} = \\frac{88}{8} = 11\n\\]\nThus, the area of the region inside both the square and the rectangle is:\n\\[\n25 - 11 = 14\n\\]\nThe numerator of the simplest fraction that represents the area of the region inside both the square and the rectangle is \\(\\boxed{14}\\)."

We need to determine \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) such that the remainders match the given conditions.\n\nFirst, substitute \\( x = \\omega \\) where \\( \\omega \\) is a primitive cube root of unity (i.e., \\( \\omega^2 + \\omega + 1 = 0 \\) and \\( \\omega^3 = 1 \\)). Then:\n\\[ P(\\omega) = \\omega + 2 \\]\nSince \\( \\omega^2 + 1 = -\\omega \\), we have:\n\\[ P(\\omega) = (x^2 + 1)Q_2(x) + 2x + 1 = -\\omega Q_2(\\omega) + 2\\omega + 1 \\]\nThus:\n\\[ -\\omega Q_2(\\omega) + 2\\omega + 1 = \\omega + 2 \\]\n\\[ -\\omega Q_2(\\omega) + \\omega = 1 \\]\n\\[ \\omega(-Q_2(\\omega) + 1) = 1 \\]\nSince \\( \\omega \\neq 0 \\), we get:\n\\[ -Q_2(\\omega) + 1 = \\frac{1}{\\omega} \\]\n\\[ Q_2(\\omega) = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\omega} = 1 + \\omega^2 \\]\nSimilarly, substitute \\( x = i \\) where \\( i \\) is the imaginary unit (i.e., \\( i^2 + 1 = 0 \\) and \\( i^3 = -i \\)). Then:\n\\[ P(i) = 2i + 1 \\]\nSince \\( x^2 + x + 1 = 0 \\) for \\( x = \\omega \\) and \\( x = \\omega^2 \\), we have:\n\\[ P(i) = (x^2 + x + 1)Q_1(x) + i + 2 = Q_1(i) + i + 2 \\]\nThus:\n\\[ Q_1(i) + i + 2 = 2i + 1 \\]\n\\[ Q_1(i) = i - 1 \\]\nNow, we need to find the polynomial \\( P(x) \\) of the form \\( ax + b \\). We know:\n\\[ P(\\omega) = \\omega + 2 \\]\n\\[ P(i) = 2i + 1 \\]\nSo, we have the system of equations:\n\\[ a\\omega + b = \\omega + 2 \\]\n\\[ ai + b = 2i + 1 \\]\nFrom the second equation, we get:\n\\[ b = 2i + 1 - ai \\]\nSubstitute this into the first equation:\n\\[ a\\omega + 2i + 1 - ai = \\omega + 2 \\]\n\\[ a(\\omega - i) = \\omega + 1 - 2i \\]\nSince \\( \\omega = -\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}i \\), we have:\n\\[ \\omega - i = -\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}i - i = -\\frac{1}{2} + \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} - 1\\right)i \\]\nThus:\n\\[ a\\left(-\\frac{1}{2} + \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} - 1\\right)i\\right) = -\\frac{1}{2} + \\left(1 - \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)i + 1 \\]\n\\[ a\\left(-\\frac{1}{2} + \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} - 1\\right)i\\right) = \\frac{1}{2} + \\left(1 - \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)i \\]\nBy comparing the real and imaginary parts, we get:\n\\[ -\\frac{1}{2}a = \\frac{1}{2} \\implies a = -1 \\]\n\\[ \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} - 1\\right)a = 1 - \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\implies a = -1 \\]\nSo, \\( a = -1 \\) and \\( b = 2i + 1 - (-1)i = 2i + 1 + i = 1 + 3i \\). Therefore, the polynomial is:\n\\[ P(x) = -x + 1 + 3i \\]\nThe sum of the squares of the coefficients is:\n\\[ (-1)^2 + (1)^2 + (3i)^2 = 1 + 1 - 9 = -7 \\]\nHowever, since the coefficients are rational, we need to re-evaluate the polynomial with rational coefficients. The correct polynomial is:\n\\[ P(x) = -x + 1 \\]\nThe sum of the squares of the coefficients is:\n\\[ (-1)^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 1 = 2 \\]\nThus, the answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{5} \\]"

This simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n6\\theta = 2k\\pi \\implies \\theta = \\frac{k\\pi}{3}\n\\]\n\nThe value of \\( \\theta \\) must be taken modulo \\( 2\\pi \\), so \\( \\theta \\) can take on the values \\( \\frac{k\\pi}{3} \\) for \\( k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 \\). This gives us 6 distinct values for \\( \\theta \\) in the interval \\( [0, 2\\pi) \\).\n\nNow, we consider the two cases for \\( r \\):\n\n1. If \\( r = 0 \\), then \\( z = 0 \\). This is one solution.\n2. If \\( r = 1 \\), then \\( z = e^{i\\theta} \\) where \\( \\theta = \\frac{k\\pi}{3} \\) for \\( k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 \\). This gives us 6 solutions.\n\nAdding these together, we have 1 solution from \\( r = 0 \\) and 6 solutions from \\( r = 1 \\), giving us a total of \\( 1 + 6 = 7 \\) solutions.\n\nTherefore, the number of complex numbers that satisfy the equation \\( z^5 = \\overline{z} \\) is \\(\\boxed{10}\\)."

            "To find the maximum value of the imaginary part of a complex number \\( z \\) satisfying \\( |1 + z + z^2| = 4 \\), we start by letting \\( z = x + yi \\), where \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are real numbers.

However, a more straightforward approach is to use the fact that the maximum imaginary part of \\( z \\) occurs when \\( z \\) is on the boundary of the circle and is aligned in a specific direction.\n\nBy symmetry and the properties of the circle, the maximum imaginary part of \\( z \\) is achieved when \\( z \\) is on the boundary of the circle and is aligned with the imaginary axis. This occurs when the imaginary part of \\( z \\) is maximized, which is when \\( z = -\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{\\sqrt{15}}{2}i \\).\n\nThus, the maximum value of the imaginary part of \\( z \\) is \\( \\frac{\\sqrt{15}}{2} \\).

            "To determine the units digit of the sum of the 2023 numbers in the 2023rd row of the given triangular array, we first need to understand the pattern in the array. Let's denote the sum of the numbers in the \\(n\\)-th row by \\(S_n\\).\n\nFrom the given rows, we can observe the following:\n- The sum of the numbers in the 1st row is \\(1\\).\n- The sum of the numbers in the 2nd row is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\).\n- The sum of the numbers in the 3rd row is \\(1 + 3 + 1 = 5\\).\n- The sum of the numbers in the 4th row is \\(1 + 5 + 5 + 1 = 12\\).\n- The sum of the numbers in the 5th row is \\(1 + 7 + 11 + 7 + 1 = 27\\).\n\nWe can see that the sum of the numbers in the \\(n\\)-th row is \\(S_n = n^2\\). We can prove this by induction.\n\n**Base Case:** For \\(n = 1\\), \\(S_1 = 1^2 = 1\\), which is true.\n\n**Inductive Step:** Assume that the sum of the numbers in the \\(k\\)-th row is \\(S_k = k^2\\).

To find the units digit of \\(2023^2\\), we only need to consider the units digit of 2023, which is 3.

            "To solve the problem, we need to understand the structure of a regular icosahedron and the distances between its vertices. A regular icosahedron has 12 vertices, 30 edges, and 20 faces, each of which is an equilateral triangle. The distance \\(d(A, B)\\) between two vertices \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) is the minimum number of edges one must traverse to connect them.\n\nThe possible values for \\(d(A, B)\\) are 1, 2, 3, and 4.

First, we count the number of pairs \\((Q, R)\\) and \\((R, S)\\) such that \\(d(Q, R) > d(R, S)\\).\n\nThe total number of ways to choose three distinct vertices from 12 is \\(\\binom{12}{3} \\cdot 6 = 220 \\cdot 6 = 1320\\), because there are 12 choices for the first vertex, 11 for the second, and 10 for the third, and we divide by 6 to account for the order of selection.\n\nNext, we need to count the number of favorable outcomes where \\(d(Q, R) > d(R, S)\\). By symmetry, the probability that \\(d(Q, R) > d(R, S)\\) is the same as the probability that \\(d(Q, R) < d(R, S)\\), and the probability that \\(d(Q, R) = d(R, S)\\) is the remaining probability.

This is a more complex combinatorial problem, but we can use the fact that the icosahedron is highly symmetric and each distance class (1, 2, 3, 4) is equally likely to be the same for two randomly chosen vertices. Therefore, the probability that \\(d(Q, R) = d(R, S)\\) is \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) of the total probability space.\n\nThus, the probability that \\(d(Q, R) > d(R, S)\\) is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) of the total probability space, which is \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{1}{3}\\).\n\nTherefore, the probability that \\(d(Q, R) > d(R, S)\\) is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\), and the final answer is \\(1 + 2 = \\boxed{5}\\)."

            "To determine how many dates in 2023 will have each digit appearing an even number of times in the 8-digit display, we need to analyze the structure of the date format, which is YMMDD, where Y is the year, M is the month, and D is the day. For the year 2023, the format is 2023MMDD. We need to ensure that each digit in the 8-digit number 2023MMDD appears an even number of times.\n\nFirst, let's identify the fixed digits in the year 2023:\n- The digit 2 appears twice.\n- The digit 0 appears once.\n- The digit 3 appears once.\n\nThis means that the digits 2, 0, and 3 must appear an odd number of times in the entire 8-digit number 2023MMDD. Therefore, the digits M and D must together contribute an odd number of each of these digits to make the total count of each digit even. This implies that M and D must together contribute an odd number of 0s and an odd number of 3s, and an even number of 2s.\n\nSince M is a two-digit month, it can be any number from 01 to 12. D is a two-digit day, so it can be any number from 01 to 31, but it must be valid for the month M. We need to count the valid (M, D) pairs such that the total count of each digit is even.\n\nLet's break it down by the possible values of M:\n- If M is 01, 02, 03, 04, 05, 06, 07, 08, 09, 10, 11, or 12, D must contribute an odd number of 0s and an odd number of 3s to make the total count of each digit even. This means D must be a number that, when combined with M, results in an odd number of 0s and 3s in the entire 8-digit number.\n\nWe can count the valid (M, D) pairs by considering the constraints:\n- For M = 01, D must be a number that, when combined with 01, results in an odd number of 0s and 3s. This means D must be a number that, when combined with 01, results in an odd number of 0s and 3s. This is true for all valid days in January, February, March, April, May, June, July, August, September, October, November, and December.\n- For M = 02, D must be a number that, when combined with 02, results in an odd number of 0s and 3s. This means D must be a number that, when combined with 02, results in an odd number of 0s and 3s. This is true for all valid days in January, February, March, April, May, June, July, August, September, October, November, and December.\n- This pattern continues for all months from January to December.\n\nSince each month has a certain number of valid days, we need to count the valid days for each month. The valid days for each month are:\n- January: 31 days\n- February: 28 days (29 in a leap year, but 2023 is not a leap year)\n- March: 31 days\n- April: 30 days\n- May: 31 days\n- June: 30 days\n- July: 31 days\n- August: 31 days\n- September: 30 days\n- October: 31 days\n- November: 30 days\n- December: 31 days\n\nAdding these up, we get:\n\\[ 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 = 366 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of dates in 2023 for which each digit appears an even number of times in the 8-digit display is \\(\\boxed{12}\\)."

            "To determine the value of \\( x \\) in Coinland, we need to find the largest amount of money that cannot be formed using the given coin values of 6, 10, and 15 cents. This problem can be approached using the concept of the Frobenius coin problem, which deals with finding the largest number that cannot be expressed as a non-negative integer combination of given coin values.\n\nFirst, we note that the coin values are 6, 10, and 15. We will use the fact that for two coprime integers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), the largest number that cannot be expressed as a non-negative integer combination of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) is given by \\( ab - a - b \\). However, since we have three coin values, we need to consider the problem more carefully.\n\nWe start by checking if any two of the coin values are coprime. The greatest common divisor (gcd) of 6 and 10 is 2, so they are not coprime. The gcd of 6 and 15 is 3, so they are not coprime. The gcd of 10 and 15 is 5, so they are not coprime. Since none of the pairs of coin values are coprime, we need to use a different approach.\n\nWe will use the fact that the largest number that cannot be formed using three coin values can be found by checking the numbers that cannot be formed using the smallest two coin values and then checking if adding the third coin value allows us to form those numbers.\n\nWe start by finding the largest number that cannot be formed using only the 6 and 10 cent coins. Since 6 and 10 are not coprime, we use the fact that the largest number that cannot be formed using two non-coprime integers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) is \\( ab - a - b \\) divided by their gcd. Here, the gcd of 6 and 10 is 2, so we calculate:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{6 \\cdot 10 - 6 - 10}{2} = \\frac{60 - 16}{2} = \\frac{44}{2} = 22\n\\]\n\nThis means that 22 is the largest number that cannot be formed using only 6 and 10 cent coins. Now, we need to check if adding the 15 cent coin allows us to form all numbers greater than 22. We do this by checking the numbers from 23 to 28:\n\n- \\( 23 = 15 + 8 \\) (8 can be formed as \\( 6 + 2 \\cdot 1 \\))\n- \\( 24 = 15 + 9 \\) (9 can be formed as \\( 3 \\cdot 3 \\))\n- \\( 25 = 15 + 10 \\)\n- \\( 26 = 15 + 11 \\) (11 can be formed as \\( 6 + 5 \\))\n- \\( 27 = 15 + 12 \\) (12 can be formed as \\( 2 \\cdot 6 \\))\n- \\( 28 = 15 + 13 \\) (13 can be formed as \\( 6 + 7 \\) and 7 can be formed as \\( 6 + 1 \\))\n\nSince we can form all numbers from 23 to 28 using the 6, 10, and 15 cent coins, the largest number that cannot be formed is 22. Therefore, the value of \\( x \\) is 29 (since 29 is the next number after 28 that cannot be formed).\n\nThe sum of the digits of 29 is \\( 2 + 9 = 11 \\).\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{11}\n\\]"

Since the triangle has an angle of \\(120^\\circ\\), we can use the Law of Cosines to find \\(d\\).\n\nThe Law of Cosines states that for a triangle with sides \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) opposite angles \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\) respectively, \\(c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \\cos(C)\\).

Since \\(d\\) must be positive, we have \\(d = 4\\). Therefore, the side lengths of the triangle are 6, 10, and 14.\n\nNext, we use the formula for the area of a triangle given two sides and the included angle. The area \\(K\\) of a triangle with sides \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) and included angle \\(\\theta\\) is given by:\n\\[\nK = \\frac{1}{2}ab \\sin(\\theta)\n\\]\nHere, \\(a = 6\\), \\(b = 10\\), and \\(\\theta = 120^\\circ\\).

The prime factorizations of these numbers are:\n\\[\n1 = 1, \\quad 2 = 2, \\quad 3 = 3, \\quad 4 = 2^2, \\quad 5 = 5, \\quad 6 = 2 \\cdot 3\n\\]\nWhen \\( n \\) dice are rolled, the product of the numbers rolled will be a number whose prime factorization is the sum of the prime factorizations of the numbers on the dice. We need to determine the number of distinct possible products, which is equivalent to the number of distinct combinations of the exponents of the prime factors 2, 3, and 5 in the product.\n\nLet's denote the number of dice showing each number as follows:\n- \\( a_1 \\) dice show 1\n- \\( a_2 \\) dice show 2\n- \\( a_3 \\) dice show 3\n- \\( a_4 \\) dice show 4\n- \\( a_5 \\) dice show 5\n- \\( a_6 \\) dice show 6\n\nThe total number of dice is \\( n = a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + a_5 + a_6 \\). The exponent of 2 in the product is \\( 2a_2 + 2a_4 + a_6 \\), the exponent of 3 is \\( a_3 + a_6 \\), and the exponent of 5 is \\( a_5 \\). We need to determine the number of distinct combinations of these exponents.\n\nThe possible exponents for 2 range from 0 to \\( 2a_2 + 2a_4 + a_6 \\), the possible exponents for 3 range from 0 to \\( a_3 + a_6 \\), and the possible exponents for 5 range from 0 to \\( a_5 \\). The number of distinct combinations of these exponents is the product of the number of possible values for each exponent.\n\nTo find the number of distinct possible products, we need to consider the maximum possible values for the exponents. The maximum value of \\( 2a_2 + 2a_4 + a_6 \\) is \\( 2n \\) (if all dice show 2 or 4), the maximum value of \\( a_3 + a_6 \\) is \\( n \\) (if all dice show 3 or 6), and the maximum value of \\( a_5 \\) is \\( n \\) (if all dice show 5). However, the actual number of distinct combinations is less than or equal to the number of distinct combinations of the exponents, which is the number of distinct possible products.\n\nWe need to find \\( n \\) such that the number of distinct possible products is 936. The number 936 can be factored as:\n\\[\n936 = 2^3 \\cdot 3^1 \\cdot 13^1\n\\]\nThis suggests that the exponents of 2, 3, and 5 must be able to take on a sufficient number of distinct values to produce 936 distinct combinations.

For \\(x \\in (3, \\infty)\\), all terms \\(x\\), \\(2 - x\\), and \\(x - 3\\) are positive, so the fraction is negative.\n\nThus, the expression \\(\\frac{x(2 - x)}{x - 3}\\) is non-negative in the intervals \\((-\\infty, 0)\\) and \\((2, 3)\\).\n\nNow, we need to translate these intervals back in terms of \\(n\\). Recall that \\(x = \\log n\\), so:\n\n1. For \\(\\log n \\in (-\\infty, 0)\\), we have \\(n \\in (0, 1)\\).\n2. For \\(\\log n \\in (2, 3)\\), we have \\(n \\in (10^2, 10^3) = (100, 1000)\\).\n\nSince \\(n\\) is an integer, the possible values of \\(n\\) are the integers in the intervals \\((0, 1)\\) and \\((100, 1000)\\). The interval \\((0, 1)\\) does not contain any integers, and the interval \\((100, 1000)\\) contains the integers from 101 to 999, inclusive. The number of integers in this range is \\(999 - 101 + 1 = 899\\).\n\nTherefore, the number of integers \\(n\\) for which the given expression represents a real number is \\(\\boxed{899}\\)."
