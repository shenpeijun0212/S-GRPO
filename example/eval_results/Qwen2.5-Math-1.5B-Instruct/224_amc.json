The prime factorizations are:\n\\[ 45 = 3^2 \\cdot 5 \\]\n\\[ 15 = 3 \\cdot 5 \\]\nThe GCD of two numbers is the product of the lowest powers of all prime factors present in both numbers. Therefore, \\( n \\) must include the factor \\( 3 \\) and \\( 5 \\), and cannot include the factor \\( 2 \\) (since the GCD does not include 2).

            "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many children of each type (truth-tellers, alternaters, and liars) there are, and then find out how many of the truth-tellers received candy.\n\nLet's define the variables:\n- \\( T \\) is the number of truth-tellers.\n- \\( A \\) is the number of alternaters.\n- \\( L \\) is the number of liars.\n\nWe know the total number of children is 31, so we have:\n\\[ T + A + L = 31. \\]\n\nNext, we analyze the responses to the three questions:\n\n1. \"Are you a truth-teller?\" The truth-tellers will answer \"Yes,\" the liars will answer \"No,\" and the alternaters will answer \"Yes\" if they start with a lie and \"No\" if they start with the truth. Therefore, the number of \"Yes\" answers to this question is \\( T + \\frac{A}{2} \\). We know that 22 children answered \"Yes,\" so:\n\\[ T + \\frac{A}{2} = 22. \\]\n\n2. \"Are you an alternater?\" The truth-tellers will answer \"No,\" the liars will answer \"No,\" and the alternaters will answer \"Yes\" if they start with the truth and \"No\" if they start with a lie. Therefore, the number of \"Yes\" answers to this question is \\( \\frac{A}{2} \\). We know that 15 children answered \"Yes,\" so:\n\\[ \\frac{A}{2} = 15. \\]\nThis implies:\n\\[ A = 30. \\]\n\n3. \"Are you a liar?\" The truth-tellers will answer \"No,\" the liars will answer \"Yes,\" and the alternaters will answer \"Yes\" if they start with the truth and \"No\" if they start with a lie. Therefore, the number of \"Yes\" answers to this question is \\( L + \\frac{A}{2} \\). We know that 9 children answered \"Yes,\" so:\n\\[ L + \\frac{A}{2} = 9. \\]\nSince \\( A = 30 \\), we have:\n\\[ L + 15 = 9, \\]\nwhich implies:\n\\[ L = -6. \\]\nThis is not possible, so we need to re-evaluate the problem with the correct interpretation of the alternaters' responses. The correct interpretation is that the alternaters will answer \"Yes\" if they start with the truth and \"No\" if they start with a lie. Therefore, the number of \"Yes\" answers to this question is \\( \\frac{A}{2} \\). We know that 9 children answered \"Yes,\" so:\n\\[ \\frac{A}{2} = 9. \\]\nThis implies:\n\\[ A = 18. \\]\n\nNow we substitute \\( A = 18 \\) into the first equation:\n\\[ T + 18 + L = 31, \\]\nwhich simplifies to:\n\\[ T + L = 13. \\]\n\nWe also substitute \\( A = 18 \\) into the second equation:\n\\[ T + \\frac{18}{2} = 22, \\]\nwhich simplifies to:\n\\[ T + 9 = 22, \\]\nso:\n\\[ T = 13. \\]\n\nThen we substitute \\( T = 13 \\) into the equation \\( T + L = 13 \\):\n\\[ 13 + L = 13, \\]\nso:\n\\[ L = 0. \\]\n\nTherefore, there are 13 truth-tellers, 18 alternaters, and 0 liars. Since the principal gave candy to 22 children who answered \"Yes\" to the first question, and all 13 truth-tellers answered \"Yes,\" the number of pieces of candy given to the truth-tellers is:\n\\[ \\boxed{13}. \\]"

            "To determine the area of the region inside both the square and the rectangle, we start by analyzing the given geometric configuration. The rectangle has side lengths 4 and 8, and the square has a side length of 5. The square is positioned such that three of its vertices lie on three different sides of the rectangle.\n\nFirst, let's place the rectangle in the coordinate plane with vertices at \\((0,0)\\), \\((8,0)\\), \\((8,4)\\), and \\((0,4)\\). Assume the square is positioned such that one of its vertices is at \\((x,0)\\) on the bottom side of the rectangle, another vertex is at \\((8,y)\\) on the right side of the rectangle, and the third vertex is at \\((8-x,4)\\) on the top side of the rectangle. The fourth vertex of the square will be at \\((x,4-y)\\).\n\nSince the side length of the square is 5, the distance between \\((x,0)\\) and \\((8,y)\\) must be 5. Using the distance formula, we have:\n\\[\n\\sqrt{(8-x)^2 + y^2} = 5\n\\]\nSquaring both sides, we get:\n\\[\n(8-x)^2 + y^2 = 25\n\\]\nSimilarly, the distance between \\((8,y)\\) and \\((8-x,4)\\) must also be 5. Using the distance formula again, we have:\n\\[\n\\sqrt{(8-x-8)^2 + (4-y-y)^2} = 5\n\\]\nSimplifying, we get:\n\\[\n\\sqrt{x^2 + (4-2y)^2} = 5\n\\]\nSquaring both sides, we get:\n\\[\nx^2 + (4-2y)^2 = 25\n\\]\nWe now have two equations:\n1. \\((8-x)^2 + y^2 = 25\\)\n2. \\(x^2 + (4-2y)^2 = 25\\)\n\nExpanding and simplifying the first equation:\n\\[\n(8-x)^2 + y^2 = 25 \\implies 64 - 16x + x^2 + y^2 = 25 \\implies x^2 + y^2 - 16x = -39\n\\]\nExpanding and simplifying the second equation:\n\\[\nx^2 + (4-2y)^2 = 25 \\implies x^2 + 16 - 16y + 4y^2 = 25 \\implies x^2 + 4y^2 - 16y = 9\n\\]\nWe now have the system of equations:\n1. \\(x^2 + y^2 - 16x = -39\\)\n2. \\(x^2 + 4y^2 - 16y = 9\\)\n\nSubtract the first equation from the second:\n\\[\n(x^2 + 4y^2 - 16y) - (x^2 + y^2 - 16x) = 9 - (-39) \\implies 3y^2 + 16x - 16y = 48 \\implies 3y^2 + 16x - 16y = 48\n\\]\nSolving for \\(x\\):\n\\[\n16x = 48 - 3y^2 + 16y \\implies x = \\frac{48 - 3y^2 + 16y}{16} = 3 - \\frac{3y^2}{16} + y\n\\]\nSubstitute \\(x = 3 - \\frac{3y^2}{16} + y\\) into the first equation:\n\\[\n\\left(3 - \\frac{3y^2}{16} + y\\right)^2 + y^2 - 16\\left(3 - \\frac{3y^2}{16} + y\\right) = -39\n\\]\nSimplifying, we find \\(y = 2\\) and \\(x = 3\\). Therefore, the vertices of the square are \\((3,0)\\), \\((8,2)\\), \\((3,4)\\), and \\((0,2)\\).\n\nThe area of the region inside both the square and the rectangle is the area of the square minus the areas of the four right triangles outside the rectangle.

We know that the sum of the row sums must equal the sum of the column sums, which is \\(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10\\). This is consistent because the total number of \\(1\\)s in the array is the same whether we sum the rows or the columns.\n\nWe need to find the number of ways to arrange the row sums and column sums such that each is a permutation of \\(\\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}\\). The number of permutations of four distinct numbers is \\(4! = 24\\). However, not all permutations of the row sums and column sums will necessarily correspond to a valid array. We need to ensure that the array can be constructed with these row and column sums.\n\nTo do this, we can use the fact that the problem of finding the number of \\(0\\)-\\(1\\) matrices with given row and column sums is a classic problem in combinatorics, and it can be solved using the method of inclusion-exclusion or by considering the structure of the matrix.\n\nOne useful approach is to use the fact that the problem is equivalent to finding the number of \\(4 \\times 4\\) binary matrices with specified row and column sums. This is a well-known problem in combinatorial matrix theory, and the solution can be found using the method of generating functions or by direct counting.\n\nThe number of such matrices is given by the formula for the number of \\(0\\)-\\(1\\) matrices with specified row and column sums, which is the coefficient of \\(x_1 x_2 x_3 x_4 y_1 y_2 y_3 y_4\\) in the expansion of the generating function \\((1 + x_1 + x_1^2 + \\cdots)(1 + x_2 + x_2^2 + \\cdots)(1 + x_3 + x_3^2 + \\cdots)(1 + x_4 + x_4^2 + \\cdots)(1 + y_1 + y_1^2 + \\cdots)(1 + y_2 + y_2^2 + \\cdots)(1 + y_3 + y_3^2 + \\cdots)(1 + y_4 + y_4^2 + \\cdots)\\) with the constraints \\(x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 = 10\\) and \\(y_1 + y_2 + y_3 + y_4 = 10\\).\n\nAfter calculating, we find that the number of such matrices is 90. Therefore, the number of \\(4 \\times 4\\) arrays whose entries are \\(0\\)s and \\(1\\)s such that the row sums are \\(1, 2, 3, 4\\) in some order and the column sums are also \\(1, 2, 3, 4\\) in some order is 90.\n\nThe remainder when 90 is divided by 100 is \\(\\boxed{90}\\)."

Finally, we need to determine \\(m+n+p\\).\n\nFirst, recall that the centroid \\(G\\) of a triangle divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the longer segment being closer to the vertex. Therefore, \\(AG = \\frac{2}{3}AD\\) and \\(BG = \\frac{2}{3}BE\\).\n\nSince \\(\\triangleAGB\\) is equilateral, all its sides are equal, so \\(AG = BG = AB\\).

            "To determine the probability that Amelia's position when she stops will be greater than 1, we need to analyze the possible outcomes of her movements step by step.\n\nFirst, let's define the random variables:\n- \\( t_n \\) is the time duration for the \\( n \\)-th step, chosen uniformly from \\((0,1)\\).\n- \\( x_n \\) is the increment for the \\( n \\)-th step, chosen uniformly from \\((0,1)\\).\n\nAnt Amelia will stop after the first step if \\( t_1 \\leq 1 \\), after the second step if \\( t_1 + t_2 \\leq 1 \\), and after the third step if \\( t_1 + t_2 + t_3 \\leq 1 \\). However, since she stops after at most 3 steps, we need to consider the probability that she stops after each step and the position at that stop.\n\n### Step 1: Probability that Amelia stops after the first step\nThe probability that \\( t_1 \\leq 1 \\) is 1 because \\( t_1 \\) is always in the interval \\((0,1)\\). If she stops after the first step, her position is \\( x_1 \\). The probability that \\( x_1 > 1 \\) is 0 because \\( x_1 \\) is always in the interval \\((0,1)\\).\n\n### Step 2: Probability that Amelia stops after the second step\nThe probability that \\( t_1 + t_2 \\leq 1 \\) is the area of the region in the unit square \\((0,1) \\times (0,1)\\) below the line \\( t_1 + t_2 = 1 \\). This area is a right triangle with legs of length 1, so the area is \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\). If she stops after the second step, her position is \\( x_1 + x_2 \\). The probability that \\( x_1 + x_2 > 1 \\) is the area of the region in the unit square above the line \\( x_1 + x_2 = 1 \\), which is also a right triangle with legs of length 1, so the area is \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\). Therefore, the probability that she stops after the second step and her position is greater than 1 is \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4} \\).\n\n### Step 3: Probability that Amelia stops after the third step\nThe probability that \\( t_1 + t_2 + t_3 \\leq 1 \\) is the volume of the region in the unit cube \\((0,1) \\times (0,1) \\times (0,1)\\) below the plane \\( t_1 + t_2 + t_3 = 1 \\). This volume is a tetrahedron with vertices at \\((0,0,0)\\), \\((1,0,0)\\), \\((0,1,0)\\), and \\((0,0,1)\\), so the volume is \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\). If she stops after the third step, her position is \\( x_1 + x_2 + x_3 \\). The probability that \\( x_1 + x_2 + x_3 > 1 \\) is the volume of the region in the unit cube above the plane \\( x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = 1 \\), which is \\( 1 - \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{5}{6} \\). Therefore, the probability that she stops after the third step and her position is greater than 1 is \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\times \\frac{5}{6} = \\frac{5}{36} \\).\n\n### Total Probability\nThe total probability that Amelia's position when she stops will be greater than 1 is the sum of the probabilities of the two scenarios where this happens:\n\\[ \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{6} \\times \\frac{5}{6} = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{5}{36} = \\frac{9}{36} + \\frac{5}{36} = \\frac{14}{36} = \\frac{7}{18}. \\]\n\nThe denominator plus the numerator of the probability is \\( 18 + 7 = 25 \\).\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{25} \\]"

This is an arithmetic sequence with the first term 7 and the common difference 7. The number of terms in this sequence can be found by solving the equation:\n\\[ 7n \\leq 1000 \\implies n \\leq \\frac{1000}{7} \\approx 142.857. \\]\nSo, there are 142 multiples of 7 in the range from 1 to 1000.\n\nNow, we need to determine how many multiples of 7 are in each set of 10 consecutive integers.

Thus, we have:\n\n\\[\n\\log_{7x}2023 = \\frac{\\log_{10}2023}{\\log_{10}(7x)}, \\quad \\log_{289x}2023 = \\frac{\\log_{10}2023}{\\log_{10}(289x)}, \\quad \\log_{2023x}2023 = \\frac{\\log_{10}2023}{\\log_{10}(2023x)}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting these into the original equation, we get:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\log_{10}2023}{\\log_{10}(7x)} \\cdot \\frac{\\log_{10}2023}{\\log_{10}(289x)} = \\frac{\\log_{10}2023}{\\log_{10}(2023x)}\n\\]\n\nWe can cancel \\(\\log_{10}2023\\) from both sides of the equation (assuming \\(\\log_{10}2023 \\neq 0\\)):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\log_{10}2023}{\\log_{10}(7x)} \\cdot \\frac{\\log_{10}2023}{\\log_{10}(289x)} = \\frac{\\log_{10}2023}{\\log_{10}(2023x)}\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\log_{10}2023}{\\log_{10}(7x) \\log_{10}(289x)} = \\frac{\\log_{10}2023}{\\log_{10}(2023x)}\n\\]\n\nAgain, we can cancel \\(\\log_{10}2023\\) from both sides (assuming \\(\\log_{10}2023 \\neq 0\\)):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{\\log_{10}(7x) \\log_{10}(289x)} = \\frac{1}{\\log_{10}(2023x)}\n\\]\n\nThis implies:\n\n\\[\n\\log_{10}(7x) \\log_{10}(289x) = \\log_{10}(2023x)\n\\]\n\nWe can rewrite the logarithms using the properties of logarithms. Note that \\(289 = 17^2\\), so \\(\\log_{10}(289x) = \\log_{10}(17^2 x) = 2 \\log_{10}17 + \\log_{10}x\\). Also, \\(\\log_{10}(2023x) = \\log_{10}2023 + \\log_{10}x\\). Substituting these into the equation, we get:\n\n\\[\n\\log_{10}(7x) (2 \\log_{10}17 + \\log_{10}x) = \\log_{10}2023 + \\log_{10}x\n\\]\n\nExpanding the left side, we have:\n\n\\[\n2 \\log_{10}(7x) \\log_{10}17 + \\log_{10}(7x) \\log_{10}x = \\log_{10}2023 + \\log_{10}x\n\\]\n\nThis can be rewritten as:\n\n\\[\n2 \\log_{10}7 \\log_{10}x \\log_{10}17 + 2 \\log_{10}x \\log_{10}17 + \\log_{10}7 \\log_{10}x = \\log_{10}2023 + \\log_{10}x\n\\]\n\nFactoring out \\(\\log_{10}x\\) from the left side, we get:\n\n\\[\n\\log_{10}x (2 \\log_{10}7 \\log_{10}17 + 2 \\log_{10}17 + \\log_{10}7) = \\log_{10}2023\n\\]\n\nThis equation must hold for some value of \\(x\\). To find the product of all solutions, we note that the equation is symmetric in a certain sense. If \\(x\\) is a solution, then \\(\\frac{2023}{7x}\\) is also a solution because the original equation is symmetric in \\(7x\\) and \\(\\frac{2023}{x}\\). Therefore, the product of the solutions is:\n\n\\[\nx \\cdot \\frac{2023}{7x} = \\frac{2023}{7}\n\\]\n\nThus, the product of all solutions to the equation is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{2023}\n\\]"

The running total can be 3 if the last roll is a 3, or if the running total before the last roll is 1 or 2 and the last roll is 2 or 1, respectively. We will consider each case separately.\n\n1. **Case 1: The last roll is 3.**\n   - The first three rolls can be any combination of numbers that sum to 0, 1, or 2. However, since the minimum value of a die roll is 1, the only valid sequence is (1, 1, 1) because any other combination would result in a sum greater than 2.\n   - Therefore, the valid sequences are: (1, 1, 1, 3), (1, 1, 2, 3), (1, 2, 1, 3), (2, 1, 1, 3).\n\n2. **Case 2: The running total before the last roll is 1 or 2.**\n   - If the running total before the last roll is 1, the last roll must be 2.\n   - If the running total before the last roll is 2, the last roll must be 1.\n   - Therefore, the valid sequences are: (1, 1, 1, 2), (1, 1, 2, 1), (1, 2, 1, 1), (2, 1, 1, 1).\n\nCombining both cases, we have the following valid sequences:\n(1, 1, 1, 3), (1, 1, 2, 3), (1, 2, 1, 3), (2, 1, 1, 3), (1, 1, 1, 2), (1, 1, 2, 1), (1, 2, 1, 1), (2, 1, 1, 1).\n\nThere are 8 valid sequences out of a total of \\(6^4 = 1296\\) possible sequences of rolls.

            "To determine how many dates in the year 2023 will have each digit appearing an even number of times in the 8-digit display, we need to analyze the structure of the date format, which is YMMDD. Here, Y is the year (2023), MM is the month, and DD is the day. The year 2023 has the digits 2, 0, 2, and 3, so we need to ensure that the digits in the month and day parts of the date, when combined with these, result in each digit appearing an even number of times in the entire 8-digit number.\n\nFirst, let's list the digits in the year 2023: 2, 0, 2, 3. This gives us two 2's, one 0, and one 3. For each digit in the final 8-digit number to appear an even number of times, the digits in the month and day parts must collectively provide an even count for each digit. This means that the digits in the month and day parts must collectively provide an even count for the digits 2, 0, and 3, and an odd count for the digit 1 (since it is not present in the year).\n\nThe digits in the month (MM) can be any number from 01 to 12, and the digits in the day (DD) can be any number from 01 to 31. We need to check which combinations of MM and DD will result in each digit appearing an even number of times in the 8-digit number.\n\nLet's analyze the possible values for MM and DD:\n- The digit 2 must appear an even number of times, so the month must have a 2 (i.e., it must be February, April, June, August, October, or December).\n- The digit 0 must appear an even number of times, so the month must have a 0 (i.e., it must be January or July).\n- The digit 3 must appear an even number of times, so the month must have a 3 (i.e., it must be March).\n- The digit 1 must appear an odd number of times, so the month must have a 1 (i.e., it must be January).\n\nFrom the above, we see that the only month that can satisfy all these conditions is January. In January, the day (DD) can be any number from 01 to 31, and we need to check if the day can be chosen such that the digit 2 appears an even number of times, the digit 0 appears an even number of times, and the digit 3 appears an even number of times.\n\nIf the month is January, the day can be any number from 01 to 31. We need to check the digit counts:\n- The digit 2 appears once in the year.\n- The digit 0 appears once in the year.\n- The digit 3 appears once in the year.\n- The digit 1 appears in the day (since January has 31 days).\n\nTo have each digit appear an even number of times, the day must not contribute any additional even counts for the digits 2, 0, and 3. This means the day must be a number that does not contain the digits 2, 0, or 3. The possible days are 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, and 31, excluding those that contain the digits 2, 0, or 3. The valid days are 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, and 31, excluding 2, 0, and 3. This gives us 22 valid days.\n\nTherefore, there are 22 dates in 2023 where each digit appears an even number of times in the 8-digit display. The answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{12}\n\\]"

            "To find the maximum area of an isosceles trapezoid with legs of length 1 and one base twice as long as the other, we start by defining the lengths of the bases. Let the lengths of the bases be \\(a\\) and \\(2a\\). We need to find the height of the trapezoid, which we will denote as \\(h\\).\n\nFirst, we drop perpendiculars from the endpoints of the shorter base \\(a\\) to the longer base \\(2a\\). These perpendiculars will divide the longer base into three segments: two segments of length \\(x\\) (the legs of the right triangles formed) and one segment of length \\(a\\) (the shorter base). Therefore, we have:\n\\[2a = a + 2x \\implies x = \\frac{a}{2}.\\]\n\nIn each of the right triangles, the hypotenuse is 1 (the length of the legs of the trapezoid), one leg is \\(x = \\frac{a}{2}\\), and the other leg is the height \\(h\\) of the trapezoid. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we get:\n\\[1^2 = \\left(\\frac{a}{2}\\right)^2 + h^2 \\implies 1 = \\frac{a^2}{4} + h^2 \\implies h^2 = 1 - \\frac{a^2}{4} \\implies h = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{a^2}{4}}.\\]\n\nThe area \\(A\\) of the trapezoid is given by the formula:\n\\[A = \\frac{1}{2} \\times (a + 2a) \\times h = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 3a \\times \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{a^2}{4}} = \\frac{3a}{2} \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{a^2}{4}}.\\]\n\nTo maximize the area, we need to maximize the function \\(A(a) = \\frac{3a}{2} \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{a^2}{4}}\\).

However, since we have three coin values, we need to consider the problem more carefully.\n\nWe start by checking if any two of the coin values are coprime. The greatest common divisor (gcd) of 6 and 10 is 2, so they are not coprime. The gcd of 6 and 15 is 3, so they are not coprime. The gcd of 10 and 15 is 5, so they are not coprime. Since none of the pairs are coprime, we need to use a different approach.\n\nWe will use the fact that the largest number that cannot be expressed using the given coin values can be found by checking the numbers systematically.

The rectangle can be placed either horizontally or vertically. If placed horizontally, it can cover any of the following pairs of squares: (1,2), (2,3), (4,5), (5,6), (7,8), (8,9). If placed vertically, it can cover any of the following pairs of squares: (1,4), (2,5), (3,6), (4,7), (5,8), (6,9).\n\nThere are 6 possible horizontal placements and 6 possible vertical placements, giving us a total of 12 possible placements for the rectangle.\n\nTo ensure that we cover at least one square of the rectangle, we need to consider the worst-case scenario where the rectangle is placed in such a way that it avoids our guesses as long as possible. We can use a strategy of guessing squares in a way that maximizes the information we get from each guess.\n\nOne effective strategy is to guess the center square of the grid, which is the square at position (2,2).

The polynomial \\( P(x) \\) is a product of factors, each of which is a power of a linear term. The sign of \\( P(x) \\) changes at each root, and the sign depends on the parity of the exponent of the corresponding factor.\n\n1. For \\( x \\in (-\\infty, 1) \\), all factors \\( (x-1), (x-2), \\ldots, (x-10) \\) are negative. Since there are 10 factors, and 10 is an even number, the product of these factors is positive. Therefore, \\( P(x) > 0 \\) in \\( (-\\infty, 1) \\).\n2. For \\( x \\in (1, 2) \\), the factor \\( (x-1) \\) is positive, and all other factors are negative. Since there are 9 negative factors, the product is negative. Therefore, \\( P(x) < 0 \\) in \\( (1, 2) \\).\n3. For \\( x \\in (2, 3) \\), the factors \\( (x-1) \\) and \\( (x-2) \\) are positive, and all other factors are negative. Since there are 8 negative factors, the product is positive. Therefore, \\( P(x) > 0 \\) in \\( (2, 3) \\).\n4. This pattern continues, with the sign of \\( P(x) \\) alternating between the intervals. Specifically, \\( P(x) \\) is positive in the intervals \\( (-\\infty, 1) \\), \\( (2, 3) \\), \\( (4, 5) \\), \\ldots, \\( (10, \\infty) \\), and negative in the intervals \\( (1, 2) \\), \\( (3, 4) \\), \\( (5, 6) \\), \\ldots, \\( (9, 10) \\).\n\nSince there are 11 intervals and the polynomial changes sign at each root, \\( P(x) \\) is positive in 10 of these intervals. Therefore, the number of intervals on which \\( P(x) \\) is positive is \\(\\boxed{10}\\)."

            "To determine for how many integers \\( n \\) the expression \\(\\sqrt{\\frac{\\log (n^2) - (\\log n)^2}{\\log n - 3}}\\) represents a real number, we need to ensure that the expression inside the square root is non-negative. Let's start by simplifying the expression inside the square root.\n\nFirst, we use the property of logarithms that \\(\\log(n^2) = 2\\log n\\). Substituting this into the expression, we get:\n\\[\n\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\log n - (\\log n)^2}{\\log n - 3}}\n\\]\nLet \\( x = \\log n \\). Then the expression becomes:\n\\[\n\\sqrt{\\frac{2x - x^2}{x - 3}}\n\\]\nFor the square root to be defined and real, the expression inside the square root must be non-negative:\n\\[\n\\frac{2x - x^2}{x - 3} \\geq 0\n\\]\nWe need to analyze the sign of the fraction \\(\\frac{2x - x^2}{x - 3}\\). First, we find the roots of the numerator and the denominator:\n\\[\n2x - x^2 = x(2 - x) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad x - 3 = 0 \\implies x = 3\n\\]\nSo, the numerator \\(2x - x^2\\) is zero at \\(x = 0\\) and \\(x = 2\\), and the denominator \\(x - 3\\) is zero at \\(x = 3\\). We need to determine the sign of the expression \\(\\frac{x(2 - x)}{x - 3}\\) in the intervals determined by these roots: \\((-\\infty, 0)\\), \\((0, 2)\\), \\((2, 3)\\), and \\((3, \\infty)\\).\n\n1. For \\(x \\in (-\\infty, 0)\\), \\(x < 0\\), \\(2 - x > 0\\), and \\(x - 3 < 0\\). So, \\(\\frac{x(2 - x)}{x - 3} > 0\\).\n2. For \\(x \\in (0, 2)\\), \\(x > 0\\), \\(2 - x > 0\\), and \\(x - 3 < 0\\). So, \\(\\frac{x(2 - x)}{x - 3} < 0\\).\n3. For \\(x \\in (2, 3)\\), \\(x > 0\\), \\(2 - x < 0\\), and \\(x - 3 < 0\\). So, \\(\\frac{x(2 - x)}{x - 3} > 0\\).\n4. For \\(x \\in (3, \\infty)\\), \\(x > 0\\), \\(2 - x < 0\\), and \\(x - 3 > 0\\). So, \\(\\frac{x(2 - x)}{x - 3} < 0\\).\n\nThus, the expression \\(\\frac{2x - x^2}{x - 3} \\geq 0\\) is satisfied for \\(x \\in (-\\infty, 0] \\cup (2, 3)\\). Since \\(x = \\log n\\), we need to translate these intervals back to \\(n\\):\n1. \\(\\log n \\leq 0 \\implies n \\leq 10^0 = 1\\). So, \\(n \\in (-\\infty, 1]\\).\n2. \\(2 < \\log n < 3 \\implies 10^2 < n < 10^3 \\implies 100 < n < 1000\\).\n\nSince \\(n\\) is an integer, the possible values of \\(n\\) are \\(n = 1, 2, 3, \\ldots, 99\\) and \\(n = 101, 102, \\ldots, 999\\). Counting these, we have 99 integers from 1 to 99 and 900 integers from 101 to 999, giving a total of \\(99 + 900 = 999\\) integers.\n\nTherefore, the number of integers \\(n\\) for which the given expression represents a real number is \\(\\boxed{999}\\)."
