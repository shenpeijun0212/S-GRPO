            "To solve the problem, we need to understand the relationship between the energy radiated by the Sun and its radius.

The characteristic equation for this homogeneous equation is:\n\\[ s^4 - 1 = 0. \\]\nThis can be factored as:\n\\[ (s^2 - 1)(s^2 + 1) = 0, \\]\nwhich gives the roots:\n\\[ s = \\pm 1, \\pm i. \\]\nThe homogeneous solution is:\n\\[ x_h(t) = C_1 e^t + C_2 e^{-t} + C_3 \\cos t + C_4 \\sin t. \\]\n\n### Step 2: Find the particular solution\nWe need to find a particular solution to the non-homogeneous equation \\(\\frac{d^4 x}{dt^4} - x = e^{-2t}\\). Since the right-hand side is \\(e^{-2t}\\) and \\(-2\\) is not a root of the characteristic equation, we can use the exponential response formula. The particular solution is of the form:\n\\[ x_p(t) = A e^{-2t}. \\]\nWe need to find the value of \\(A\\). First, we compute the fourth derivative of \\(x_p(t)\\):\n\\[ \\frac{d^4}{dt^4} (A e^{-2t}) = A \\frac{d^4}{dt^4} (e^{-2t}) = A (-2)^4 e^{-2t} = 16A e^{-2t}. \\]\nSubstituting \\(x_p(t)\\) and its fourth derivative into the differential equation, we get:\n\\[ 16A e^{-2t} - A e^{-2t} = e^{-2t}, \\]\n\\[ 15A e^{-2t} = e^{-2t}, \\]\n\\[ 15A = 1, \\]\n\\[ A = \\frac{1}{15}. \\]\nSo, the particular solution is:\n\\[ x_p(t) = \\frac{1}{15} e^{-2t}. \\]\n\n### Step 3: Find the general solution\nThe general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and the particular solution:\n\\[ x(t) = x_h(t) + x_p(t) = C_1 e^t + C_2 e^{-t} + C_3 \\cos t + C_4 \\sin t + \\frac{1}{15} e^{-2t}. \\]\n\nThus, the general solution is:\n\\[ \\boxed{C_1 e^t + C_2 e^{-t} + C_3 \\cos t + C_4 \\sin t + \\frac{1}{15} e^{-2t}}. \\]"

            "To formulate the state-determined equation of motion for the angular velocity \\(\\omega\\) of the rollertor under the influence of an applied torque \\(T\\) and frictional torques from two bearings, we need to consider the following steps:\n\n1. **Identify the forces and torques acting on the rollertor:**\n   - The applied torque \\(T\\).\n   - The frictional torques from the two bearings, each with a frictional coefficient \\(B\\). Therefore, the total frictional torque is \\(2B\\omega\\) (since the frictional torque is proportional to the angular velocity \\(\\omega\\) and there are two bearings).\n\n2. **Apply Newton's second law for rotation:**\n   The net torque on the rollertor is the sum of the applied torque \\(T\\) and the frictional torques. According to Newton's second law for rotation, the net torque is equal to the moment of inertia \\(I\\) times the angular acceleration \\(\\alpha\\). Since \\(\\alpha = \\frac{d\\omega}{dt}\\), we can write:\n   \\[\n   T - 2B\\omega = I \\frac{d\\omega}{dt}\n   \\]\n   Rearranging this equation, we get the state-determined equation of motion for the angular velocity \\(\\omega\\):\n   \\[\n   I \\frac{d\\omega}{dt} + 2B\\omega = T\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the state-determined equation of motion for the angular velocity \\(\\omega\\) as output and the torque \\(T\\) as input is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{I \\frac{d\\omega}{dt} + 2B\\omega = T}\n\\]"

To find the light travel time in minutes, we use the fact that 1 light year is approximately 5.88 \\times 10^12 miles and that light travels at 1.86 \\times 10^5 miles per second.

            "To determine the age of the universe when most hadrons were formed in minutes, we need to use the current age of the universe and the time it took for hadrons to form. The current age of the universe is approximately 13.8 billion years. The hadrons were formed when the temperature was so high that they could not combine to form larger hadrons. This happened about 10 minutes after the big expansion of the universe.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the age of the universe from years to minutes. There are 365.25 days in a year, 24 hours in a day, 60 minutes in an hour, and 60 seconds in a minute. Therefore, the number of minutes in a year is:\n\n\\[ 365.25 \\times 24 \\times 60 \\times 60 = 5259600 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nSo, the age of the universe in minutes is:\n\n\\[ 13.8 \\times 5259600 = 72548880 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find the nearest power of 10 to 72548880. The powers of 10 are 10, 100, 1000, 10000, etc. We can see that 72548880 is between 10000000 and 100000000. To be more precise, we can calculate the logarithm base 10 of 72548880:\n\n\\[ \\log_{10}(72548880) \\approx 7.86 \\]\n\nSince 7.86 is closer to 8 than to 7, the nearest power of 10 to 72548880 is \\(10^8\\).\n\nTherefore, the age of the universe when most hadrons were formed, to the nearest power of 10, is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10^8 \\text{ minutes}} \\]"

Let's break it down step by step.\n\n### Subproblem 0: Speed of Manny Relativize\n\n1. **Understanding the Geometry**:\n   - Manny is running towards first base at an angle of \\(45^\\circ\\) to the line from third base to home plate.\n   - This means that the angle between the line from third base to home plate and the line from third base to Manny's position is \\(45^\\circ\\).\n\n2. **Using the Relativity Formula**:\n   - The formula for the observed angle \\(\\theta'\\) when a body is moving at speed \\(\\beta\\) relative to an observer is given by:\n     \\[\n     \\cos \\theta' = \\frac{\\cos \\theta - \\beta}{1 - \\beta \\cos \\theta}\n     \\]\n   - Here, \\(\\theta = 45^\\circ\\) and \\(\\beta = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\).\n   - Substituting these values into the formula, we get:\n     \\[\n     \\cos \\theta' = \\frac{\\cos 45^\\circ - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}}{1 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\cos 45^\\circ} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}}{1 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}} = \\frac{0}{1 - \\frac{1}{2}} = 0\n     \\]\n   - This means that \\(\\theta' = 90^\\circ\\), which is consistent with the problem statement that Manny sees third base \\(45^\\circ\\) to his left.\n\n3. **Finding the Speed**:\n   - The speed of Manny Relativity is given by \\(\\beta = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\), which is a fraction of the speed of light \\(c\\).\n   - Therefore, the speed of Manny Relativity is \\(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}c\\).\n\n### Subproblem 1: Wavelength of Manny's Light\n\n1. **Understanding the Wavelength Shift**:\n   - The problem states that a player standing on third base is wearing red socks andis starting with light of wavelength \\(\\lambda_{\\text{red}}\\).\n   - Since Manny is moving at a speed of \\(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}c\\), the light he sees will be redshifted due to the Relativity effect.\n\n2. **Using the Wavelength Shift Formula**:\n   - The formula for the observed wavelength \\(\\lambda'\\) when a body is moving at speed \\(\\beta\\) relative to an observer is given by:\n     \\[\n     \\lambda' = \\lambda_{\\text{red}} \\sqrt{\\frac{1 - \\beta}{1 + \\beta}}\n     \\]\n   - Substituting \\(\\beta = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\) into the formula, we get:\n     \\[\n     \\lambda' = \\lambda_{\\text{red}} \\sqrt{\\frac{1 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}}{1 + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}}} = \\lambda_{\\text{red}} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sqrt{2} - 1}{\\sqrt{2} + 1}}\n     \\]\n   - To simplify the expression inside the square root, we rationalize the denominator:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{\\sqrt{2} - 1}{\\sqrt{2} + 1} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{2} - 1}{\\sqrt{2} - 1} = \\frac{(\\sqrt{2} - 1)^2}{2 - 1} = (\\sqrt{2} - 1)^2 = 2 - 2\\sqrt{2} + 1 = 3 - 2\\sqrt{2}\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, the observed wavelength is:\n     \\[\n     \\lambda' = \\lambda_{\\text{red}} \\sqrt{3 - 2\\sqrt{2}}\n     \\]\n\nThe final answer is \\(\\boxed{\\lambda_{\\text{red}} \\sqrt{3 - 2\\sqrt{2}}}\\)."

However, without specific information about the nature of argillic, we can assume it is a strong base, such as sodiumargillic (NaA).\n\n2. **Determine the charge of the salt**: A strong base like sodiumargillic (NaA) is a salt of a strong base (sodium hydroxide, NaOH) and a strong acid (argon, Ar). When NaA is added to water, it dissociates into Na+ and A- ions. The A- ion is the conjugate base of the weak acid argon, and it will hydrolyze in water to produce OH- ions. The net effect is that the solution will have a net negative charge because the OH- ions are produced, which are not counterbalanced by cations like Na+.\n\n3. **Calculate the net charge**: The net charge of the solution will be determined by the charge of the cations and anions present.

For speeds much less than the speed of light, the momentum can be approximated as:\n\\[\np \\approx m v\n\\]\nThe de Broglie wavelength can then be written as:\n\\[\n\\lambda = \\frac{h}{m v}\n\\]\n\nFor diffraction, the de Broglie wavelength \\(\\lambda\\) must be equal to the distance between the planes of the diffraction pattern, which is given by:\n\\[\n\\lambda = \\frac{a}{\\sin \\theta}\n\\]\nwhere \\(a\\) is the lattice spacing of the gold planes and \\(\\theta\\) is the angle of diffraction. The lattice spacing \\(a\\) for gold can be found using the reciprocal of the diffraction condition:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{a} = n \\lambda\n\\]\nwhere \\(n\\) is the order of diffraction. For the first order diffraction (\\(n = 1\\)):\n\\[\na = \\frac{\\lambda}{\\sin \\theta}\n\\]\n\nThe lattice spacing \\(a\\) for gold can be found using the diffraction condition for gold, which is given by:\n\\[\n\\frac{2 \\pi}{\\lambda} = \\frac{2 \\pi}{\\lambda_0} \\sin \\theta\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\lambda_0\\) is the wavelength of the electrons when they are not diffraction. The wavelength \\(\\lambda_0\\) is given by:\n\\[\n\\lambda_0 = \\frac{h}{\\sqrt{2 m_e k T}}\n\\]\nwhere \\(k\\) is the gas constant and \\(T\\) is the temperature. However, for simplicity, we can use the relationship between the wavelength and the acceleration potential \\(V\\):\n\\[\n\\lambda = \\frac{h}{\\sqrt{2 m_e e V}}\n\\]\nwhere \\(e\\) is the elementary charge.

The area of the (111) plane is the area of an equilateral triangle with side length \\(a\\sqrt{2}\\) (since the plane intersects the cubic lattice at the face diagonals).\n\nThe area \\(A\\) of an equilateral triangle with side length \\(s\\) is given by:\n\\[ A = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2 \\]\nFor the (111) plane, the side length \\(s = a\\sqrt{2}\\), so the area of the (111) plane is:\n\\[ A = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} (a\\sqrt{2})^2 = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} \\cdot 2a^2 = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} a^2 \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine the number of atoms in the (111) plane. The (111) plane intersects the cubic lattice at three atoms per unit cell diagonal, so it contains 3 atoms.\n\nThe planar packing density is the number of atoms per unit area. Since the area of the unit cell is \\(a^2\\), the planar packing density \\(D\\) is:\n\\[ D = \\frac{\\text{Number of atoms}}{\\text{Area of the plane}} = \\frac{3}{\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} a^2} = \\frac{6}{\\sqrt{3} a^2} = \\frac{6\\sqrt{3}}{3a^2} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{a^2} \\]\n\nGiven that the radius of the atom \\(r = 0.77 \\AA\\), the edge length of the unit cell \\(a = 2r = 2 \\times 0.77 = 1.54 \\AA\\). Substituting \\(a = 1.54 \\AA\\) into the planar packing density formula, we get:\n\\[ D = \\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{(1.54)^2} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{2.3716} \\approx \\frac{2 \\times 1.732}{2.3716} \\approx \\frac{3.464}{2.3716} \\approx 1.465 \\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the planar packing density is:\n\\[ \\boxed{1.47 \\times 10^0} \\]"

            "To determine the optimal price of apples in Cambridge, we need to analyze the supply and demand for apples. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Identify the supply and demand:**\n   - The local orchard can produce up to 50 apples per day at a constant marginal cost of 25 cents per apple.\n   - The store can supply any remaining apples at a constant marginal cost of 75 cents per apple.\n   - When the price is 75 cents per apple, the residents of Cambridge buy 150 apples in a day.\n\n2. **Determine the total demand:**\n   - At a price of 75 cents per apple, the total demand is 150 apples. This means that the store is supplying the remaining apples after the orchard has produced 50 apples. Therefore, the store is supplying \\(150 - 50 = 100\\) apples at 75 cents per apple.\n\n3. **Calculate the total cost of production:**\n   - The orchard produces 50 apples at 25 cents per apple, so the cost for the orchard is \\(50 \\times 25 = 1250\\) cents.\n   - The store produces 100 apples at 75 cents per apple, so the cost for the store is \\(100 \\times 75 = 7500\\) cents.\n   - The total cost of production is \\(1250 + 7500 = 8750\\) cents.\n\n4. **Determine the optimal price:**\n   - The total demand is 150 apples, and the total cost of production is 8750 cents. To find the optimal price, we need to find the price that maximizes the profit. The profit is given by the total revenue minus the total cost.\n   - Let \\(P\\) be the price per apple. The total revenue is \\(150P\\) cents.\n   - The total cost is 8750 cents.\n   - The profit is \\(150P - 8750\\) cents.\n   - To maximize the profit, we need to find the price \\(P\\) that satisfies the demand curve. Since the demand is linear, we can use the point where the price is 75 cents and the quantity is 150 apples to find the demand curve.\n   - The demand curve can be written as \\(Q = a - bP\\), where \\(Q\\) is the quantity demanded, \\(P\\) is the price, \\(a\\) is the intercept, and \\(b\\) is the slope.\n   - At \\(P = 75\\) cents, \\(Q = 150\\) apples. So, \\(150 = a - 75b\\).\n   - The intercept \\(a\\) is the maximum quantity demanded when the price is 0, which is 150 apples.\n   - The slope \\(b\\) is the change in quantity demanded per unit change in price, which is \\(-\\frac{150}{75} = -2\\).\n   - Therefore, the demand curve is \\(Q = 150 - 2P\\).\n   - To find the optimal price, we need to find the price where the total revenue is maximized. The total revenue is \\(150P - 2P^2\\).\n   - To maximize the total revenue, we take the derivative of the total revenue with respect to \\(P\\) and set it to zero.\n   - The derivative of \\(150P - 2P^2\\) is \\(150 - 4P\\).\n   - Setting the derivative to zero, we get \\(150 - 4P = 0\\), so \\(P = \\frac{150}{4} = 37.5\\) cents.\n\nTherefore, the optimal price that the city of Cambridge should set is \\(\\boxed{37.5}\\) cents."

            "To determine the algebraic condition that describes a firm that is at an output level that maximizes its profits given its capital in the short-term, we need to use some basic principles from microeconmetry, particularly the concept of profit maximization.\n\n1. **Define the profit function**: The profit function for a firm is given by the difference between its total revenue (TR) and its total cost (TC). If we denote the output level by \\( Q \\), the profit function can be written as:\n   \\[\n   \\pi(Q) = TR(Q) - TC(Q)\n   \\]\n   where \\( TR(Q) \\) is the total revenue as a function of output \\( Q \\), and \\( TC(Q) \\) is the total cost as a function of output \\( Q \\).\n\n2. **First-order condition for profit maximization**: To find the output level that maximizes profit, we need to take the derivative of the profit function with respect to \\( Q \\) and set it equal to zero. This is because at the profit\u6700\u5927\u5316 output level, the slope of the profit function (which is the derivative of profit with respect to output) is zero. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d\\pi(Q)}{dQ} = \\frac{dTR(Q)}{dQ} - \\frac{dTC(Q)}{dQ} = 0\n   \\]\n   The derivative of total revenue with respect to output is the price (since \\( TR(Q) = P \\cdot Q \\) and \\( P \\) is the price per unit), and the derivative of total cost with respect to output is the marginal cost (since \\( TC(Q) = C(Q) \\) and \\( \\frac{dC(Q)}{dQ} = MC(Q) \\)). Therefore, the first-order condition for profit maximization can be written as:\n   \\[\n   P = MC\n   \\]\n   where \\( P \\) is the price per unit and \\( MC \\) is the marginal cost.\n\n3. **AC and MC relationship**: In the short-run, a firm that is at an output level that maximizes its profits will have the price equal to the marginal cost. This is because if the price were greater than the marginal cost, the firm could increase its profit by producing more units, and if the price were less than the marginal cost, the firm could increase its profit by producing fewer units. Therefore, the algebraic condition that describes a firm that is at an output level that maximizes its profits given its capital in the short-term is:\n   \\[\n   \\boxed{P = MC}\n   \\]"
