For the cosine function, we know that:\n\\[\n\\mathcal{L}\\{\\cos \\omega_{d} t\\} = \\frac{s}{s^2 + \\omega_{d}^2}\n\\]\nApplying the frequency shift property, we get:\n\\[\n\\mathcal{L}\\{e^{-\\sigma t} \\cos \\omega_{d} t\\} = \\frac{s + \\sigma}{(s + \\sigma)^2 + \\omega_{d}^2}\n\\]\nSo, the Laplace transform \\( Y(s) \\) is:\n\\[\nY(s) = \\frac{s + \\sigma}{(s + \\sigma)^2 + \\omega_{d}^2}\n\\]\n\n### Final Answers\n\nThe final answers are:\n1. For \\( y(t) = e^{-a t} \\), the Laplace transform is:\n\\[\nY(s) = \\frac{1}{s + a}\n\\]\n2. For \\( y(t) = e^{-\\sigma t} \\sin \\omega_{d} t \\), the Laplace transform is:\n\\[\nY(s) = \\frac{\\omega_{d}}{(s + \\sigma)^2 + \\omega_{d}^2}\n\\]\n3. For \\( y(t) = e^{-\\sigma t} \\cos \\omega_{d} t \\), the Laplace transform is:\n\\[\nY(s) = \\frac{s + \\sigma}{(s + \\sigma)^2 + \\omega_{d}^2}\n\\]\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{s + \\sigma}{(s + \\sigma)^2 + \\omega_{d}^2}}\n\\]"

            "To determine the age of the universe when most hadrons were formed in minutes, we need to use the current age of the universe and the time it took for hadrons to form. The current age of the universe is approximately 13.8 billion years. The hadrons were formed when the temperature of the universe was high enough to allow hadrons to form, which is around 1 second after the big expansion.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the age of the universe from years to seconds. There are 365.25 days in a year, 24 hours in a day, 60 minutes in an hour, and 60 seconds in a minute. Therefore, the number of seconds in a year is:\n\n\\[ 365.25 \\times 24 \\times 60 \\times 60 = 31,557,600 \\text{ seconds} \\]\n\nSo, the age of the universe in seconds is:\n\n\\[ 13.8 \\times 10^9 \\text{ years} \\times 31,557,600 \\text{ seconds\/year} = 432,452,448,000,000 \\text{ seconds} \\]\n\nNext, we need to convert this time into minutes. There are 60 seconds in a minute, so:\n\n\\[ 432,452,448,000,000 \\text{ seconds} \\div 60 \\text{ seconds\/minute} = 7,207,540,800,000 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nNow, we need to round this number to the nearest power of 10. The number 7,207,540,800,000 is between \\(10^7\\) and \\(10^8\\). To determine which power of 10 it is closer to, we compare it to \\(10^7 = 10,000,000\\) and \\(10^8 = 100,000,000\\). Since 7,207,540,800,000 is closer to \\(10^8\\) than to \\(10^7\\), we round it to \\(10^8\\).\n\nTherefore, the age of the universe when most hadrons were formed, in minutes, to the nearest power of 10 is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{10^8}\n\\]"

He sees third base at an angle of \\(45^\\circ\\) to his left. This means that the angle between his direction of running and the line from third base to his current position is \\(45^\\circ\\).\n\nIn special relativity, the observed angle \\(\\theta'\\) is related to the actual angle \\(\\theta\\) by the formula:\n\\[\n\\cos \\theta' = \\frac{\\cos \\theta - \\beta}{1 - \\beta \\cos \\theta}\n\\]\nHere, \\(\\theta = 45^\\circ\\) and \\(\\cos 45^\\circ = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\). Substituting these values into the formula, we get:\n\\[\n\\cos \\theta' = \\frac{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} - \\beta}{1 - \\beta \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}}\n\\]\nWe are given that \\(\\cos \\theta' = -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\).

Let's verify this by substituting \\(\\beta = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\) back into the original formula:\n\\[\n\\cos \\theta' = \\frac{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}}{1 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}} = \\frac{0}{1 - \\frac{1}{2}} = 0\n\\]\nThis is not correct, so the given solution is incorrect. The correct speed of Manny Relativity is \\(\\beta = \\frac{2\\sqrt{2}}{3}\\).\n\n### Step 2: Determine the wavelength of light seen by Manny\nThe wavelength of light seen by Manny is given by the formula:\n\\[\n\\lambda' = \\lambda_{\\text{red}} \\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}\n\\]\nSubstituting \\(\\beta = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\):\n\\[\n\\lambda' = \\lambda_{\\text{red}} \\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)^2} = \\lambda_{\\text{red}} \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2}} = \\lambda_{\\text{red}} \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}} = \\lambda_{\\text{red}} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\n\\]\nSo, the wavelength of light seen by Manny is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\lambda_{\\text{red}}}\n\\]"

Therefore, the energy of the ver non is \\( E_{\\nu} = 2m_p c^2 - 2 \\gamma m_p c^2 = 2m_p c^2 (1 - \\gamma) \\).\n\nHowever, we need to express \\( E_{\\nu} \\) in terms of \\(\\theta\\), \\(m_p\\), and \\(\\gamma\\). The energy of the ver non in the rest frame of the deuton is simply the rest mass energy of the ver non, which is \\( 2m_p c^2 \\).\n\nThus, the energy of the ver non in the rest frame of the deuton is:\n\n\\[\nE_{\\nu} = 2m_p c^2\n\\]\n\nSince the energy of the ver non is simply the rest mass energy of the ver non, the energy of the ver non in the rest frame of the deuton is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{2m_p c^2}\n\\]"

The speed of light \\( c \\) is approximately \\( 3 \\times 10^8 \\) meters per second.

Rearranging this equation to solve for the wavelength, we get:\n\\[ \\lambda = \\frac{c}{v} \\]\n\nTo find the maximum wavelength, we need to use the minimum frequency in the AM band, which is 5.35 times 10^6 hz.

However, in reality, the gold atoms are not perfect spheres and there is some hard-sphere packing, meaning there is some empty space between the atoms. The hard-sphere approximation tells us that the volume occupied by the gold atoms is only a fraction of the total molar volume. The fraction of the volume occupied by the atoms is the ratio of the volume of the atoms to the molar volume:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Fraction of volume occupied by atoms} = \\frac{V_{\\text{ atoms}}}{V_{\\text{molar}}} = \\frac{7.56 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ cm}^3}{10.3 \\text{ cm}^3\/\\text{mole}} = 7.37 \\times 10^{-7}\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the fraction of the volume that is empty space (void volume) is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{ void volume fraction} = 1 - 7.37 \\times 10^{-7} \\approx 1\n   \\]\n   This means that the void volume is approximately the total molar volume minus the volume occupied by the atoms:\n   \\[\n   V_{\\text{void}} = V_{\\text{molar}} - V_{\\text{ atoms}} = 10.3 \\text{ cm}^3\/\\text{mole} - 7.56 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ cm}^3 \\approx 10.3 \\text{ cm}^3\/\\text{mole}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the total void volume**: The total void volume is the void volume fraction times the total molar volume:\n   \\[\n   V_{\\text{ void}} = \\text{ void volume fraction} \\times V_{\\text{molar}} = 1 \\times 10.3 \\text{ cm}^3\/\\text{mole} = 10.3 \\text{ cm}^3\/\\text{mole}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total void volume of gold at \\(27^\\circ \\text{C}\\) is \\(\\boxed{10.30}\\)."

            "To calculate the planar packing fraction of the (110) plane for aluminum at 300 K, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the lattice parameter of aluminum.\n2. Determine the number of atoms in the (110) plane.\n3. Determine the area of the (110) plane.\n4. Determine the area occupied by the atoms in the (110) plane.\n5. Calculate the planar packing fraction.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the lattice parameter of aluminum\nThe lattice parameter of aluminum (Al) is approximately \\( a = 4.04 \\) Angstrons.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the number of atoms in the (110) plane\nThe (110) plane in a cubic lattice of aluminum contains 2 atoms. This is because the plane intersects the lattice along two lattice points and does not include the third point that would complete a unit cell.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the area of the (110) plane\nThe area of the (110) plane is the area of a rectangle with sides equal to the lattice parameter \\( a \\) and the distance between the two atoms along the (110) plane. The distance between the two atoms along the (110) plane is \\( \\frac{a\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\) (since the (110) plane is at a 45-degree angle to the lattice).\n\nSo, the area of the (110) plane is:\n\\[ A = a \\times \\frac{a\\sqrt{2}}{2} = \\frac{a^2\\sqrt{2}}{2} = \\frac{(4.04)^2 \\sqrt{2}}{2} = \\frac{16.3216 \\times 1.414}{2} = \\frac{23.027}{2} = 11.5135 \\text{ square Angstrons} \\]\n\n### Step 4: Determine the area occupied by the atoms in the (110) plane\nEach atom in the (110) plane is a sphere with a diameter equal to the lattice parameter \\( a \\), so the radius of each atom is \\( \\frac{a}{2} \\).

            "To determine the algebraic condition that describes a firm that is at an output level that maximizes its profits given its capital in the short-term, we need to use some basic principles from microeconmetry, particularly the concept of profit maximization.\n\n1. **Define the profit function**: The profit function for a firm is given by the difference between its total revenue (TR) and its total cost (TC). If we let \\( P \\) be the price per unit of output, \\( Q \\) be the quantity of output, \\( R \\) be the revenue function, \\( C \\) be the cost function, and \\( \\pi \\) be the profit function, then the profit function can be written as:\n   \\[\n   \\pi = R(Q) - C(Q)\n   \\]\n   where \\( R(Q) = P \\cdot Q \\) and \\( C(Q) \\) is the cost function.\n\n2. **First-order condition for profit maximization**: To find the output level that maximizes profit, we take the derivative of the profit function with respect to quantity \\( Q \\) and set it equal to zero. This is because at the profit\u6700\u5927\u5316 output level, the slope of the profit function (which is the difference between the slopes of the revenue and cost functions) is zero. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d\\pi}{dQ} = \\frac{dR}{dQ} - \\frac{dC}{dQ} = 0\n   \\]\n   Since \\( \\frac{dR}{dQ} = P \\) (because price is constant), we have:\n   \\[\n   P - \\frac{dC}{dQ} = 0\n   \\]\n   This simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   P = \\frac{dC}{dQ}\n   \\]\n   The term \\( \\frac{dC}{dQ} \\) is the marginal cost (MC) of producing an additional unit of output. Therefore, the condition for profit maximization is:\n   \\[\n   P = MC\n   \\]\n\n3. **AC and MC relationship**: In the short-run, a firm's total cost curve is typically U-shaped, meaning it has a minimum point where the average cost (AC) curve is at its lowest. At the profit\u6700\u5927\u5316 output level, the price \\( P \\) is equal to the marginal cost \\( MC \\), and this output level is also where the average cost curve is at its minimum. This is because if \\( P > MC \\), the firm can increase profit by producing more output, and if \\( P < MC \\), the firm can increase profit by producing less output. Therefore, the profit\u6700\u5927\u5316 condition can be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   P = MC\n   \\]\n\nThus, the algebraic condition that describes a firm that is at an output level that maximizes its profits, given its capital in the short-term, is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{P = MC}\n\\]"

            "To find the equation of the demand curve for steel, we need to use the information given about the price, quantity, and the price elasticity of demand. The general form of a linear demand curve is:\n\n\\[ Q_d = a - bP \\]\n\nwhere \\( Q_d \\) is the quantity demanded, \\( P \\) is the price, \\( a \\) is the intercept, and \\( b \\) is the slope of the demand curve. The slope \\( b \\) is related to the price elasticity of demand \\( \\epsilon_d \\) by the formula:\n\n\\[ \\epsilon_d = \\frac{dQ_d}{dP} \\cdot \\frac{P}{Q_d} = -b \\cdot \\frac{P}{Q_d} \\]\n\nGiven that the price last year was $20 per ton and 100 million tons were sold, we have \\( P = 20 \\) and \\( Q_d = 100 \\). The price elasticity of demand is given as \\( \\epsilon_d = -0.25 \\). Substituting these values into the equation for the price elasticity, we get:\n\n\\[ -0.25 = -b \\cdot \\frac{20}{100} \\]\n\\[ -0.25 = -b \\cdot 0.2 \\]\n\\[ b = \\frac{0.25}{0.2} = 1.25 \\]\n\nSo, the slope of the demand curve is \\( b = 1.25 \\). Now we can write the demand equation as:\n\n\\[ Q_d = a - 1.25P \\]\n\nTo find the intercept \\( a \\), we use the point \\( (P, Q_d) = (20, 100) \\):\n\n\\[ 100 = a - 1.25 \\cdot 20 \\]\n\\[ 100 = a - 25 \\]\n\\[ a = 125 \\]\n\nTherefore, the equation of the demand curve is:\n\n\\[ Q_d = 125 - 1.25P \\]\n\nSo the final answer is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{Q_d = 125 - 1.25P} \\]"

The characteristic polynomial is:\n\\[\n\\det\\left(\\begin{array}{ccc}\n10 - \\lambda & 1 & 0 \\\\\n1 & -\\lambda & 2 \\\\\n0 & 2 & -10 - \\lambda\n\\end{array}\\right) = 0\n\\]\nExpanding the determinant, we get:\n\\[\n(10 - \\lambda) \\left[ \\lambda(-10 - \\lambda) - 4 \\right] - 1 \\left[ -10 - \\lambda \\right] = 0\n\\]\n\\[\n(10 - \\lambda) \\left[ -10\\lambda - \\lambda^2 - 4 \\right] + 10 + \\lambda = 0\n\\]\n\\[\n(10 - \\lambda) \\left[ -\\lambda^2 - 10\\lambda - 4 \\right] + 10 + \\lambda = 0\n\\]\n\\[\n-10\\lambda^2 - 100\\lambda - 40 + \\lambda^3 + 10\\lambda^2 + 4\\lambda + 10 + \\lambda = 0\n\\]\n\\[\n\\lambda^3 - 95\\lambda - 30 = 0\n\\]\nThe eigenvalues are approximately \\(\\lambda_1 \\approx 10.0\\), \\(\\lambda_2 \\approx -10.0\\), and \\(\\lambda_3 \\approx -0.0\\). These correspond to the eigen-eneries \\(\\widetilde{10}\\), \\(\\widetilde{0}\\), and \\(-\\widetilde{10}\\) respectively.\n\nNext, we use first-order degenerate perturbation theory to find the energy shift to first order. Since \\(\\widetilde{10}\\) is degenerate with \\(\\widetilde{0}\\), we need to use second-order degenerate perturbation theory.
