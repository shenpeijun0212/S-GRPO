This involves the concept of the critical angle, which is the angle of incidence in the water for which the angle of refraction in the air is 90 degrees. If the angle of incidence is greater than the critical angle, the light will be total internal reflection and will not exit the water.\n\n### Subproblem 0: Finding the angle of the light once it exits the water into the air, \\(\\theta_a\\), in terms of \\(\\theta_w\\)\n\nWe use Snell's law, which states that the ratio of the sine of the angle of incidence to the sine of the angle of refraction is equal to the ratio of the indices of refraction of the two media. Here, the light is incident on the water surface from air, and it exits into air. The index of refraction of air is approximately 1, and the index of refraction of water is 1.3. Therefore, Snell's law can be written as:\n\n\\[ 1 \\cdot \\sin \\theta_w = 1.3 \\cdot \\sin \\theta_a \\]\n\nRearranging to solve for \\(\\theta_a\\), we get:\n\n\\[ \\sin \\theta_a = \\frac{\\sin \\theta_w}{1.3} \\]\n\nTaking the arcsine of both sides, we obtain:\n\n\\[ \\theta_a = \\arcsin \\left( \\frac{\\sin \\theta_w}{1.3} \\right) \\]\n\nSo the expression for \\(\\theta_a\\) in terms of \\(\\theta_w\\) is:\n\n\\[ \\theta_a = \\arcsin \\left( \\frac{\\sin \\theta_w}{1.3} \\right) \\]\n\n### Subproblem 1: Finding the critical angle\n\nThe critical angle is the angle of incidence in the water for which the angle of refraction in the air is 90 degrees. At this angle, the light is just starting to total internal reflection. Using Snell's law again, we have:\n\n\\[ 1 \\cdot \\sin \\theta_c = 1.3 \\cdot \\sin 90^\\circ \\]\n\nSince \\(\\sin 90^\\circ = 1\\), this simplifies to:\n\n\\[ \\sin \\theta_c = 1.3 \\]\n\nHowever, the sine of an angle cannot be greater than 1. Therefore, the critical angle \\(\\theta_c\\) is the angle whose sine is 1, which is 90 degrees, but we need to find the angle whose sine is \\(\\frac{1}{1.3}\\).

Therefore, we can write:\n\\[\n\\frac{a}{s(s+a)} = \\frac{1}{s} - \\frac{1}{s+a}\n\\]\nSo, the expression for \\(X(s)\\) becomes:\n\\[\nX(s) = b + \\frac{1}{s} - \\frac{1}{s+a}\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to find the inverse Laplace transform of each term. The inverse Laplace transform of \\(b\\) is \\(b \\delta(t)\\), where \\(\\delta(t)\\) is the Dirac delta function. The inverse Laplace transform of \\(\\frac{1}{s}\\) is \\(1\\), and the inverse Laplace transform of \\(\\frac{1}{s+a}\\) is \\(e^{-at}\\). Therefore, the inverse Laplace transform of \\(X(s)\\) is:\n\\[\nx(t) = b \\delta(t) + 1 - e^{-at}\n\\]\n\nSince the Dirac delta function \\(\\delta(t)\\) is zero for \\(t > 0\\), it does not contribute to the function \\(x(t)\\) for \\(t > 0\\). Therefore, the inverse Laplace transform of \\(X(s)\\) for \\(t > 0\\) is:\n\\[\nx(t) = 1 - e^{-at}\n\\]\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{1 - e^{-at}}\n\\]"

This means that the angle between his direction of motion and the line from third base to his current position is \\(45^\\circ\\).\n\nWe use the velocity addition formula in special relativity to find \\(\\beta\\).

The band gap is the energy difference between the top of the valence band and the bottom of the conduction band.\n\nFor a material to appear red in transmitted light, it means that the material is a conductor or a semconductor that can allow light of a certain energy range to pass through. The band gap of a material determines the range of light that can be conducted or that will be reflected.

The lattice parameter for barium is \\(a = 0.562 \\text{ nm}\\).\n\n2. **Determine the length of the <110> direction**: The <110> direction in a body center cubic structure can be visualized as a line connecting two points on the body diagonal of the cube.

            "To solve the problems, we need to balance the chemical equation for the reaction between carbon monoxide (CO) and oxygen (O\u2082) to form carbon dioxide (CO\u2082). The unbalanced equation is:\n\n\\[ \\mathrm{CO} + \\mathrm{O}_2 \\rightarrow \\mathrm{CO}_2 \\]\n\nFirst, we need to balance the equation. We start by ensuring that the number of carbon atoms is the same on both sides of the equation. There is one carbon atom in CO and one carbon atom in CO\u2082, so the carbon atoms are already balanced.\n\nNext, we ensure that the number of oxygen atoms is the same on both sides of the equation. There is one oxygen atom in O\u2082 and two oxygen atoms in CO\u2082. To balance the oxygen atoms, we need to have two O\u2082 molecules on the left side of the equation. This gives us:\n\n\\[ \\mathrm{CO} + 2\\mathrm{O}_2 \\rightarrow \\mathrm{CO}_2 \\]\n\nNow, we check the number of oxygen atoms again. On the left side, we have one oxygen atom from CO and two oxygen atoms from each O\u2082, which totals to 5 oxygen atoms. On the right side, we have one oxygen atom in CO\u2082. The equation is not balanced yet because we have 5 oxygen atoms on the left and only 1 on the right. We need to adjust the coefficient of CO\u2082 to balance the equation. If we have one CO\u2082 molecule on the right side, we need to have 2 CO\u2082 molecules on the left side to balance the oxygen atoms. This gives us:\n\n\\[ 2\\mathrm{CO} + 2\\mathrm{O}_2 \\rightarrow 2\\mathrm{CO}_2 \\]\n\nNow, we check the number of oxygen atoms again. On the left side, we have two oxygen atoms from each O\u2082, which totals to 4 oxygen atoms, and two oxygen atoms from each CO, which totals to 2 oxygen atoms, giving us 4 + 2 = 6 oxygen atoms. On the right side, we have two oxygen atoms in each CO\u2082, and we have two CO\u2082 molecules, so we have 2 \u00d7 2 = 4 oxygen atoms. The equation is now balanced.\n\nThe balanced equation is:\n\n\\[ 2\\mathrm{CO} + 2\\mathrm{O}_2 \\rightarrow 2\\mathrm{CO}_2 \\]\n\nFrom the balanced equation, we can see that the coefficient of O\u2082 is 2, and the coefficient of CO\u2082 is 2. However, the problem specifically asks for the coefficient of O\u2082 and CO\u2082 in decimal form. Since the coefficients are whole numbers, we can express them as decimals by dividing by 1 (which does not change the value).\n\nThe coefficient of O\u2082 is 2, which in decimal form is 2.0. The coefficient of CO\u2082 is 2, which in decimal form is 2.0.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of O\u2082 is \\(\\boxed{2}\\) and the coefficient of CO\u2082 is \\(\\boxed{2}\\)."

            "To determine how many different [110]-type directions lie in the (111) plane in an cubic lattice (UAM), we need to understand the relationship between the plane and the direction in the context of the cubic lattice.\n\n1. **Identify the plane and direction**: The (111) plane in a cubic lattice is defined by the equation \\(x + y + z = 0\\). The [110] type direction means a direction with a [110] miller index, which implies the direction vector is \\((1, 1, 0)\\).\n\n2. **Find the intersection**: We need to find the intersection of the plane \\(x + y + z = 0\\) with the direction \\((1, 1, 0)\\). This means we need to find points on the plane that are parallel to the direction \\((1, 1, 0)\\). A point on the plane can be written as \\((x, y, z)\\) such that \\(x + y + z = 0\\). If we move along the direction \\((1, 1, 0)\\), we can write the coordinates of a point on the plane as \\((x, y, z) = (t, t, -2t)\\) for some parameter \\(t\\).

The direction \\((1, 1, 0)\\) can be normalized to \\((\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}, \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}, 0)\\) and its opposite \\((-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}, -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}, 0)\\). These are the only distinct directions in the plane that are parallel to \\((1, 1, 0)\\).\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The distinct [110] type directions in the (111) plane are \\((1, 1, 0)\\) and \\((-1, -1, 0)\\). Therefore, there are 2 different [110] type directions in the (111) plane.\n\nThe answer is \\(\\boxed{2}\\)."

            "To determine the atomic radius of Mo (molybdenum), we need to use the given atomic weight and density to find the volume of one mole of Mo, and then use that to find the atomic radius. Here are the steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the volume of one mole of Mo:**\n   The atomic weight of Mo is 95.94 g\/mol, and the density of Mo is 10.2 g\/cm\u00b3. The volume \\( V \\) of one mole of Mo can be calculated using the formula:\n   \\[\n   V = \\frac{\\text{mass}}{\\text{density}} = \\frac{95.94 \\text{ g}}{10.2 \\text{ g\/cm}^3} = 9.405882 \\text{ cm}^3\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the side length of the unit cell:**\n   For a face-centered cubic (FCC) unit cell, which is the structure of Mo, the volume \\( V \\) is related to the side length \\( a \\) of the unit cell by the formula:\n   \\[\n   V = a^3\n   \\]\n   So, the side length \\( a \\) is:\n   \\[\n   a = \\sqrt[3]{9.405882 \\text{ cm}^3} \\approx 2.11 \\text{ cm}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Relate the side length to the atomic radius:**\n   In anCC unit cell, the relationship between the side length \\( a \\) and the atomic radius \\( r \\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   a = 2\\sqrt{2}r\n   \\]\n   Solving for \\( r \\):\n   \\[\n   r = \\frac{a}{2\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{2.11 \\text{ cm}}{2 \\times 1.414} \\approx 0.77 \\text{ cm}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Convert the radius to meters:**\n   Since 1 cm = 0.01 m, the radius in meters is:\n   \\[\n   r = 0.77 \\text{ cm} \\times 0.01 \\text{ m\/cm} = 0.0077 \\text{ m}\n   \\]\n   To express this in the form \\( n \\times 10^x \\):\n   \\[\n   0.0077 = 7.7 \\times 10^{-3}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the atomic radius of Mo is \\(\\boxed{7.70 \\times 10^{-2}}\\) meters."

Substituting this into the equation, we get:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{3} C_0 = C_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x^2}{4D t}\\right) \\]\n\nDividing both sides by \\(C_0\\), we get:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{3} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x^2}{4D t}\\right) \\]\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides, we get:\n\n\\[ \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) = -\\frac{x^2}{4D t} \\]\n\nSince \\(\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) = -\\ln(3)\\), we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n\\[ -\\ln(3) = -\\frac{x^2}{4D t} \\]\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n\\[ \\ln(3) = \\frac{x^2}{4D t} \\]\n\nSolving for \\(x^2\\), we get:\n\n\\[ x^2 = 4D t \\ln(3) \\]\n\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get:\n\n\\[ x = \\sqrt{4D t \\ln(3)} \\]\n\nWe are given the diffusivity \\(D = 3.091 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ cm}^2\/\\text{s}\\) and the time \\(t = 10 \\text{ minutes} = 10 \\times 60 = 600 \\text{ s}\\). Substituting these values into the equation, we get:\n\n\\[ x = \\sqrt{4 \\times 3.091 \\times 10^{-6} \\times 600 \\times \\ln(3)} \\]\n\nCalculating the value inside the square root:\n\n\\[ x = \\sqrt{4 \\times 3.091 \\times 10^{-6} \\times 600 \\times 1.0986} \\]\n\\[ x = \\sqrt{8.114 \\times 10^{-3}} \\]\n\\[ x = 0.090 \\text{ cm} \\]\n\nConverting cm to \\(\\mu \\text{m}\\) (since \\(1 \\text{ cm} = 10000 \\mu \\text{m}\\)):\n\n\\[ x = 0.090 \\times 10000 = 900 \\mu \\text{m} \\]\n\nTherefore, the depth from the surface of the glass at which the concentration of helium has decreased to \\(1\/3\\) of its initial value is \\(\\boxed{900}\\) \\(\\mu \\text{m}\\)."

            "To determine the condition that involves the short-run average cost (SRAC) and describes a firm that is at a capital level that minimizes its costs in the long-term, we need to understand the relationship between the average cost and the marginal cost in the context of the long-run equilibrium.\n\nIn the long-run, a firm will produce at a level where the marginal cost (MC) equals the average cost (AC). This is because at this point, the firm is minimizing its average cost. If the marginal cost is less than the average cost, the average cost can be decreased by produce more. Conversely, if the marginal cost is greater than the average cost, the average cost can be decreased by produce less. Therefore, the long-run equilibrium condition is:\n\n\\[ MC = AC \\]\n\nHowever, in the context of the short-run, the relevant cost curves are the short-run average cost (SRAC) and the short-run marginal cost (SRMC). The short-run average cost curve (SRAC) shows the average cost of production as a function of the level of output, while the short-run marginal cost curve (SRMC) shows the additional cost of producing one more unit of output.\n\nIn the short-run, a firm will minimize its costs at the level of output where the marginal cost (MC) equals the average total cost (AC). This is because at this point, the firm is producing at the most cost-effective level of output.

            "To determine the optimal price of apples in Cambridge, we need to consider the supply and demand for apples. The local orchard can produce up to 50 apples per day at a constant marginal cost of 25 cents per apple. The store can supply any remaining apples at a constant marginal cost of 75 cents per apple. When the price of apples is 75 cents per apple, the residents of Cambridge buy 150 apples in a day. This means that the store is supplying the remaining 100 apples (150 - 50) at a price of 75 cents per apple.\n\nLet's denote the price of apples by \\( p \\) cents. The local orchard will produce up to 50 apples at a cost of 25 cents per apple, so it will produce exactly 50 apples at price \\( p \\) if \\( p \\leq 25 \\). However, since the store is supplying the remaining apples at 75 cents per apple, the price \\( p \\) must be between 25 cents and 75 cents. If \\( p > 75 \\), the store will not supply any apples, and the total quantity supplied will be less than 150 apples, which contradicts the given information.\n\nThe total quantity of apples supplied at price \\( p \\) is 50 apples from the orchard plus the quantity supplied by the store. The store will supply the remaining apples at 75 cents per apple, so the quantity supplied by the store is \\( 150 - 50 = 100 \\) apples if the price is 75 cents. For prices between 25 cents and 75 cents, the store will supply the remaining apples at 75 cents per apple, so the quantity supplied by the store is \\( 150 - 50 = 100 \\) apples if the price is 75 cents. Therefore, the total quantity supplied at price \\( p \\) is 150 apples if \\( p = 75 \\).\n\nTo find the optimal price, we need to consider the total cost of production. The total cost of producing 150 apples is the cost of producing 50 apples from the orchard plus the cost of producing the remaining 100 apples from the store. The cost of producing 50 apples from the orchard is \\( 50 \\times 25 = 1250 \\) cents. The cost of producing 100 apples from the store is \\( 100 \\times 75 = 7500 \\) cents. Therefore, the total cost of producing 150 apples is \\( 1250 + 7500 = 8750 \\) cents.\n\nTo minimize the cost per apple, we need to find the price \\( p \\) that minimizes the total cost of producing 150 apples. The total cost of producing 150 apples at price \\( p \\) is \\( 50 \\times 25 + (150 - 50) \\times p = 1250 + 100p \\). To minimize the cost per apple, we need to find the price \\( p \\) that minimizes the total cost. Since the store is supplying the remaining apples at 75 cents per apple, the price \\( p \\) must be 75 cents to satisfy the demand for 150 apples.\n\nTherefore, the optimal price of apples in Cambridge is \\(\\boxed{75}\\) cents."

        "output":[
            "To determine the algebraic condition that describes a firm that is at an output level that maximizes its profits given its capital in the short-term, we need to use some basic principles of microeconometry, particularly the concept of profit maximization.\n\n1. **Define the profit function**: The profit function for a firm is given by the difference between its total revenue (TR) and its total cost (TC). If we denote the output level by \\( Q \\), the profit function can be written as:\n   \\[\n   \\pi(Q) = TR(Q) - TC(Q)\n   \\]\n   where \\( TR(Q) \\) is the total revenue as a function of output \\( Q \\), and \\( TC(Q) \\) is the total cost as a function of output \\( Q \\).\n\n2. **First-order condition for profit maximization**: To find the output level that maximizes profit, we need to take the derivative of the profit function with respect to \\( Q \\) and set it equal to zero. This is because at the maximum point, the slope of the profit function (which is the derivative of profit with respect to output) is zero. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d\\pi(Q)}{dQ} = \\frac{dTR(Q)}{dQ} - \\frac{dTC(Q)}{dQ} = 0\n   \\]\n   The derivative of total revenue with respect to output is the price (P) at which the output is sold, and the derivative of total cost with respect to output is the marginal cost (MC). Therefore, the first-order condition for profit maximization can be written as:\n   \\[\n   P(Q) - MC(Q) = 0\n   \\]\n   or simply,\n   \\[\n   P(Q) = MC(Q)\n   \\]\n   This condition states that the price at which the firm sells its output is equal to the marginal cost of producing that output. This is the condition that must be satisfied for a firm to be at an output level that maximizes its profits.\n\n3. **AC and MC relationship**: Another way to express this condition is in terms of average cost (AC) and marginal cost (MC). The average cost is the total cost divided by the output, and the marginal cost is the additional cost of producing one more unit of output. The condition \\( P(Q) = MC(Q) \\) can be rewritten in terms of AC and MC as:\n   \\[\n   AC(Q) = P(Q) \\geq MC(Q)\n   \\]\n   This means that the average cost of production is at least as high as the marginal cost of production. When AC is equal to MC, AC is at its minimum, which is a characteristic of the profit\u6700\u5927\u5316 output level.\n\nTherefore, the algebraic condition that describes a firm that is at an output level that maximizes its profits, given its capital in the short-term, is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{P = MC}\n\\]"

            "To determine the condition that involves the short-run marginal cost (SRMC) and is related to cost minimization in the long run, we need to understand the relationship between marginal cost and average cost. Specifically, the condition that describes a firm that is at a capital level that minimizes its costs in the long run is that the short-run marginal cost (SRMC) equals the short-run average cost (SRAC).\n\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the relationship between SMC and AC**: In the short run, a firm minimizes its costs by producing at a level where the marginal cost (MC) equals the average cost (AC). This is because if MC is less than AC, the firm can produce more by expanding production, and if MC is greater than AC, the firm can produce less by decreasing production. Therefore, the firm will produce at a level where MC = AC to minimize costs.\n\n2. **Apply this to the long run**: In the long run, the firm can adjust both its output and its capital level. The condition that describes a firm that is at a capital level that minimizes its costs in the long run is that the short-run marginal cost (SRMC) equals the short-run average cost (SRAC). This is because if SMC is less than SRAC, the firm can produce more by expanding production, and if SMC is greater than SRAC, the firm can produce less by decreasing production. Therefore, the firm will produce at a level where SMC = SRAC to minimize costs.\n\nSo, the condition that involves the short-run marginal cost (SRMC) and is related to cost minimization in the long run is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{SRMC = SRAC}\n\\]"

The structure of benzene is a planar ring with alternating single and double bonds. The Hund's rule states that the lowest energy configuration for benzene is the one with the double bonds alternating, which is known as the symmetric pi conjugation.\n\nThe energy of benzene can be calculated using the Hund's rule and the given values of \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\).

When one electron is removed, the system becomes an open system, and the energy of the system will be slightly higher than that of the ground state of the full molecule. However, the exact energy of the open system is difficult to calculate directly, but we can use the fact that the energy of the open system is the energy of the ground state of the full molecule minus the energy of the removed electron.\n\nThe energy of the removed electron is \\(\\alpha\\), so:\n\n\\[ E(\\text{B}^+) = E(\\text{B}) + \\alpha = -68.6 + (-11.2) = -79.8 \\text{ eV} \\]\n\nNow, we can calculate the ionization potential:\n\n\\[ \\text{IP} = E(\\text{B}^+) - E(\\text{B}) = -79.8 - (-68.6) = -79.8 + 68.6 = -11.2 \\text{ eV} \\]\n\nTherefore, the ionization potential of benzene is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{11.2} \\]"
