Any other combination would violate the condition that the greater number in each pair is at least \\(2\\) times the lesser number."

The vertex of the parabola is at \\(t = \\frac{a}{4}\\), and we need:\n\\[\n-1 < \\frac{a}{4} < 1 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad -4 < a < 4.\n\\]\nSince we already have \\(-2 < a < 2\\), we need to check the value of the function at the vertex:\n\\[\nf\\left(\\frac{a}{4}\\right) = 4 \\left(\\frac{a}{4}\\right)^2 - 2a \\left(\\frac{a}{4}\\right) - (a + 1) = \\frac{a^2}{4} - \\frac{a^2}{2} - a - 1 = -\\frac{a^2}{4} - a - 1.\n\\]\nFor the quadratic equation to have two distinct real solutions in the interval \\((-1, 1)\\), we need:\n\\[\n-\\frac{a^2}{4} - a - 1 > 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad a^2 + 4a + 4 < 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad (a + 2)^2 < 0.\n\\]\nThis inequality is never true, so we need to check the boundary values.

            "To solve for the positive integer \\( n \\) given the conditions, we start by analyzing the least common multiple (LCM) and greatest common divisor (GCD) conditions.\n\nFirst, we know that the LCM of \\( n \\) and 18 is 180. The prime factorizations are:\n\\[ 18 = 2 \\times 3^2 \\]\n\\[ 180 = 2^2 \\times 3^2 \\times 5 \\]\nThe LCM of two numbers is the product of the highest powers of all prime factors present in either number. Therefore, \\( n \\) must include the factor \\( 2^2 \\) (since 18 only has \\( 2^1 \\) and the LCM has \\( 2^2 \\)), the factor \\( 3^2 \\) (since 18 has \\( 3^2 \\) and the LCM has \\( 3^2 \\)), and the factor \\( 5 \\) (since 18 has no factor of 5 and the LCM has \\( 5^1 \\)). Thus, \\( n \\) must be of the form:\n\\[ n = 2^2 \\times 3^2 \\times 5 \\times k = 180k \\]\nwhere \\( k \\) is an integer that does not introduce any new prime factors that are not already in 180.\n\nNext, we use the GCD condition. The GCD of \\( n \\) and 45 is 15. The prime factorizations are:\n\\[ 45 = 3^2 \\times 5 \\]\n\\[ 15 = 3 \\times 5 \\]\nThe GCD of two numbers is the product of the lowest powers of all prime factors present in both numbers. Therefore, \\( n \\) must include the factor \\( 3 \\) and the factor \\( 5 \\), but no higher powers of these primes than those in 15. Since \\( n = 180k \\) already includes \\( 3^2 \\times 5 \\), \\( k \\) must be 1 (otherwise, \\( n \\) would have a higher power of 3 than 15). Thus, \\( n = 180 \\).\n\nFinally, we verify that \\( n = 180 \\) satisfies both conditions:\n1. The LCM of 180 and 18 is 180, which is true.\n2. The GCD of 180 and 45 is 15, which is true.\n\nThe sum of the digits of \\( n = 180 \\) is:\n\\[ 1 + 8 + 0 = 9 \\]\n\nTherefore, the sum of the digits of \\( n \\) is \\(\\boxed{9}\\)."

These circles have radii 2, 8, and \\(\\sqrt{3}\\) respectively.\n\nLet's denote the radius of a circle in \\( S \\) by \\( r \\). The center of this circle is at a distance \\( r \\) from each of the three given circles. We will use the fact that the distance between the centers of two tangent circles is equal to the sum or the difference of their radii.\n\nFirst, let's consider the distance between the center of the circle in \\( S \\) and the center of the circle \\( x^2 + y^2 = 4 \\). The center of \\( x^2 + y^2 = 4 \\) is at \\((0,0)\\) and its radius is 2.

There are \\( \\binom{7}{2} = 21 \\) such pairs.\n\nThe sum of the 4th powers of the lengths of all edges and diagonals is:\n\\[\n\\sum_{0 \\leq k < m \\leq 6} 16 \\sin^4 \\left( \\frac{\\pi (m-k)}{7} \\right).\n\\]\n\nWe can use the identity for the sum of the 4th powers of the sines of angles that are multiples of \\( \\frac{\\pi}{7} \\). It is known that:\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=1}^{6} \\sin^4 \\left( \\frac{k\\pi}{7} \\right) = \\frac{3}{2}.\n\\]\n\nSince each pair \\( (k,m) \\) is counted twice in the sum (once as \\( (k,m) \\) and once as \\( (m,k) \\)), we have:\n\\[\n\\sum_{0 \\leq k < m \\leq 6} \\sin^4 \\left( \\frac{\\pi (m-k)}{7} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{k=1}^{6} 6 \\sin^4 \\left( \\frac{k\\pi}{7} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 6 \\cdot \\frac{3}{2} = \\frac{9}{2}.\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the sum of the 4th powers of the lengths of all edges and diagonals is:\n\\[\n16 \\cdot \\frac{21}{2} = 168.\n\\]\n\nFinally, we need to find the remainder when 168 is divided by 100:\n\\[\n168 \\mod 100 = 68.\n\\]\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{68}.\n\\]"

            "To find the area of the resulting 12-sided outer nonconvex polygon, we need to break down the problem into manageable parts. The polygon consists of a square with side length 1 and four regular hexagons surrounding it. Each hexagon shares one of its sides with the square.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the area of the square:\n\\[\n\\text{Area of the square} = 1^2 = 1\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find the area of one regular hexagon. The side length of each hexagon is also 1 (since it shares a side with the square). The area \\(A\\) of a regular hexagon with side length \\(s\\) is given by:\n\\[\nA = \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2} s^2\n\\]\nFor \\(s = 1\\):\n\\[\nA = \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\cdot 1^2 = \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2}\n\\]\n\nSince there are four hexagons, the total area of the four hexagons is:\n\\[\n4 \\times \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2} = 6\\sqrt{3}\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to consider the overlapping areas. Each hexagon shares one of its sides with the square, and each pair of adjacent hexagons shares a segment of their sides with the square. However, these overlapping areas are not simple to calculate directly, so we will use a different approach by considering the total area of the polygon as the sum of the areas of the square and the hexagons minus the areas of the overlapping regions.\n\nThe key insight is that the overlapping regions form smaller shapes that can be calculated. Each pair of adjacent hexagons shares a segment of length 1, and the area of the overlapping region can be found by considering the geometry of the hexagons and the square.\n\nBy symmetry and geometric properties, the overlapping regions can be shown to form smaller equilateral triangles and isosceles triangles. The total area of these overlapping regions is equivalent to the area of two equilateral triangles with side length 1, which is:\n\\[\n2 \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total area of the polygon is:\n\\[\n1 + 6\\sqrt{3} - \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} = 1 + \\frac{12\\sqrt{3}}{2} - \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} = 1 + \\frac{11\\sqrt{3}}{2}\n\\]\n\nThis can be written in the form \\(m\\sqrt{n} + p\\) where \\(m = \\frac{11}{2}\\), \\(n = 3\\), and \\(p = 1\\). However, since \\(m\\) must be an integer, we multiply the entire expression by 2 to clear the fraction:\n\\[\n2 \\left(1 + \\frac{11\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right) = 2 + 11\\sqrt{3}\n\\]\n\nThus, \\(m = 11\\), \\(n = 3\\), and \\(p = 2\\). The absolute value of \\(m + n + p\\) is:\n\\[\n11 + 3 + 2 = 16\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{16}\n\\]"

            "To solve the problem, we need to understand the structure of a regular icosahedron and the distances between its vertices. A regular icosahedron has 12 vertices, 30 edges, and 20 faces, each of which is an equilateral triangle. The distance \\(d(A, B)\\) between two vertices \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) is the minimum number of edges one must traverse to connect them.\n\nThe possible values for \\(d(A, B)\\) are 1, 2, 3, and 4. Specifically:\n- \\(d(A, B) = 1\\) if \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are adjacent vertices (i.e., they are connected by an edge).\n- \\(d(A, B) = 2\\) if \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are vertices that are not adjacent but are connected by a path of two edges.\n- \\(d(A, B) = 3\\) if \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are vertices that are not adjacent and are connected by a path of three edges.\n- \\(d(A, B) = 4\\) if \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are opposite vertices (i.e., they are connected by a path of four edges).\n\nWe need to find the probability that \\(d(Q, R) > d(R, S)\\) for randomly chosen distinct vertices \\(Q\\), \\(R\\), and \\(S\\). First, we count the number of pairs \\((Q, R)\\) and \\((R, S)\\) that satisfy this condition.\n\nThe total number of ways to choose three distinct vertices from 12 is \\(\\binom{12}{3} \\times 6 = 220 \\times 6 = 1320\\), because there are 12 choices for \\(Q\\), 11 choices for \\(R\\), and 10 choices for \\(S\\), and each set of three vertices can be arranged in 6 different orders.\n\nNext, we need to count the number of favorable outcomes where \\(d(Q, R) > d(R, S)\\). By symmetry, the number of outcomes where \\(d(Q, R) > d(R, S)\\) is the same as the number of outcomes where \\(d(Q, R) < d(R, S)\\). Therefore, we can find the number of outcomes where \\(d(Q, R) = d(R, S)\\) and subtract this from the total number of outcomes.\n\nThe number of outcomes where \\(d(Q, R) = d(R, S)\\) can be calculated as follows:\n- There are 30 edges, and for each edge, there are 10 vertices that are 2 steps away from the endpoints of the edge. So, there are \\(30 \\times 10 = 300\\) outcomes where \\(d(Q, R) = 2\\) and \\(d(R, S) = 2\\).\n- There are 60 pairs of vertices that are 3 steps apart, and for each pair, there are 2 vertices that are 1 step away from the endpoints of the pair. So, there are \\(60 \\times 2 = 120\\) outcomes where \\(d(Q, R) = 3\\) and \\(d(R, S) = 3\\).\n- There are 20 pairs of opposite vertices, and for each pair, there are 2 vertices that are 2 steps away from the endpoints of the pair. So, there are \\(20 \\times 2 = 40\\) outcomes where \\(d(Q, R) = 4\\) and \\(d(R, S) = 4\\).\n\nTherefore, the number of outcomes where \\(d(Q, R) = d(R, S)\\) is \\(300 + 120 + 40 = 460\\). The number of outcomes where \\(d(Q, R) > d(R, S)\\) is \\(\\frac{1320 - 460}{2} = 430\\).\n\nThe probability that \\(d(Q, R) > d(R, S)\\) is \\(\\frac{430}{1320} = \\frac{43}{132}\\). The sum of the numerator and the denominator is \\(43 + 132 = 175\\).\n\nThus, the answer is \\(\\boxed{175}\\)."

The running total can be 3 if the last roll is a 3, or if the running total before the last roll is 1 or 2 and the last roll is 2 or 1, respectively.

            "To determine how many dates in 2023 will have each digit appearing an even number of times in the 8-digit display, we need to analyze the structure of the date format, which is YMMDD. Here, Y is the year (2023), MM is the month, and DD is the day. The year 2023 has the digits 2, 0, 2, and 3, which means the digits 2, 0, and 3 appear an odd number of times in the year part of the date. Therefore, for each digit to appear an even number of times in the entire 8-digit display, the digits M and D must collectively contribute an odd number of each of the digits 2, 0, and 3 (since they are already contributing an odd number each from the year).\n\nLet's break this down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the constraints for M and D:**\n   - The month M can be any number from 01 to 12. This means M can be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, or 11 (where 10 and 11 are represented as 10 and 11 respectively, and 12 is represented as 12).\n   - The day D can be any number from 01 to 31, depending on the month.\n\n2. **Determine the parity of the digits in M and D:**\n   - For each digit in M and D to contribute an odd number of that digit in the entire date, M and D must collectively contribute an odd number of each of the digits 2, 0, and 3. This means that if M contributes an even number of a digit, D must contribute an odd number of that digit, and vice versa.\n\n3. **Count the valid dates:**\n   - We need to count the number of valid (M, D) pairs such that the total count of each digit 2, 0, and 3 in the date is even.\n   - Let's analyze each month:\n     - **January (01):** M = 0, D ranges from 01 to 31.

            "To solve the problem, we first need to determine the equations of the two circles. The first circle has a radius of 4 and is tangent to the y-axis at the origin. Therefore, its center is at \\((4, 0)\\). The equation of this circle is:\n\\[\n(x - 4)^2 + y^2 = 16\n\\]\nThe second circle has a radius of 10 and is tangent to the x-axis at the origin. Therefore, its center is at \\((0, 10)\\). The equation of this circle is:\n\\[\nx^2 + (y - 10)^2 = 100\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find the points of intersection of these two circles. We start by expanding the equations of the circles:\n\\[\n(x - 4)^2 + y^2 = 16 \\implies x^2 - 8x + 16 + y^2 = 16 \\implies x^2 + y^2 - 8x = 0 \\implies x^2 + y^2 = 8x\n\\]\n\\[\nx^2 + (y - 10)^2 = 100 \\implies x^2 + y^2 - 20y + 100 = 100 \\implies x^2 + y^2 = 20y\n\\]\nSince both equations are equal to \\(x^2 + y^2\\), we can set them equal to each other:\n\\[\n8x = 20y \\implies x = \\frac{5y}{2}\n\\]\nWe substitute \\(x = \\frac{5y}{2}\\) into the equation \\(x^2 + y^2 = 8x\\):\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{5y}{2}\\right)^2 + y^2 = 8\\left(\\frac{5y}{2}\\right) \\implies \\frac{25y^2}{4} + y^2 = 20y \\implies \\frac{25y^2 + 4y^2}{4} = 20y \\implies \\frac{29y^2}{4} = 20y \\implies 29y^2 = 80y \\implies y(29y - 80) = 0\n\\]\nThis gives us two solutions for \\(y\\): \\(y = 0\\) and \\(y = \\frac{80}{29}\\). Since the circles are tangent to the axes at the origin, the point \\((0, 0)\\) is not a point of intersection other than the origin.

However, since the origin is not a point of intersection other than the tangency point, we only consider \\(\\left(\\frac{200}{29}, \\frac{80}{29}\\right)\\).\n\nThe slope of the line passing through the origin \\((0, 0)\\) and the point \\(\\left(\\frac{200}{29}, \\frac{80}{29}\\right)\\) is:\n\\[\n\\text{slope} = \\frac{\\frac{80}{29} - 0}{\\frac{200}{29} - 0} = \\frac{80}{200} = \\frac{2}{5}\n\\]\nThe slope of the line is \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\), and since 2 and 5 are relatively prime, we have \\(m = 2\\) and \\(n = 5\\). Therefore, \\(m + n = 2 + 5 = 7\\).\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{7}\n\\]"

Then we have:\n\\[ (6+2d)^2 = 6^2 + (6+d)^2 - 2 \\cdot 6 \\cdot (6+d) \\cdot \\cos(120^\\circ). \\]\nSince \\(\\cos(120^\\circ) = -\\frac{1}{2}\\), the equation becomes:\n\\[ (6+2d)^2 = 36 + (6+d)^2 + 6(6+d). \\]\nExpanding both sides, we get:\n\\[ 36 + 24d + 4d^2 = 36 + 36 + 12d + d^2 + 36 + 6d, \\]\n\\[ 36 + 24d + 4d^2 = 108 + 18d + d^2. \\]\nRearranging terms, we have:\n\\[ 3d^2 + 6d - 72 = 0, \\]\n\\[ d^2 + 2d - 24 = 0. \\]\nWe solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \\(d = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\), where \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 2\\), and \\(c = -24\\):\n\\[ d = \\frac{-2 \\pm \\sqrt{4 + 96}}{2} = \\frac{-2 \\pm \\sqrt{100}}{2} = \\frac{-2 \\pm 10}{2}. \\]\nThis gives us two solutions: \\(d = 4\\) and \\(d = -6\\).

If placed vertically, it can cover any of the following pairs of squares: (1,4), (2,5), (3,6), (4,7), (5,8), (6,9).\n\nThere are 6 possible horizontal placements and 6 possible vertical placements, giving us a total of 12 possible placements for the rectangle.\n\nTo ensure that we cover at least one square of the rectangle, we need to consider the worst-case scenario where the rectangle is placed in such a way that it avoids our guesses as long as possible. We can use a strategy of guessing squares in a way that maximizes the number of squares we need to guess before we are guaranteed to find a covered square.\n\nOne effective strategy is to guess the squares in a way that covers all possible placements of the rectangle. If we guess the squares in the following order: (1, 3, 5, 7, 9), we can ensure that we will always find a covered square. Here's why:\n\n- If the rectangle is placed horizontally at (1,2), it must cover either (1,2) or (2,3). We will guess (1, 3, 5, 7, 9), and we are guaranteed to find (1,2) or (2,3) because (1,2) is covered by our first guess.\n- If the rectangle is placed horizontally at (2,3), it must cover either (2,3) or (3,6). We are guaranteed to find (2,3) or (3,6) because (2,3) is covered by our first guess.\n- If the rectangle is placed horizontally at (4,5), it must cover either (4,5) or (5,6). We are guaranteed to find (4,5) or (5,6) because (5,6) is covered by our second guess.\n- If the rectangle is placed horizontally at (5,6), it must cover either (5,6) or (6,9). We are guaranteed to find (5,6) or (6,9) because (5,6) is covered by our second guess.\n- If the rectangle is placed vertically at (1,4), it must cover either (1,4) or (4,7). We are guaranteed to find (1,4) or (4,7) because (1,4) is covered by our first guess.\n- If the rectangle is placed vertically at (2,5), it must cover either (2,5) or (5,8). We are guaranteed to find (2,5) or (5,8) because (5,8) is covered by our second guess.\n- If the rectangle is placed vertically at (3,6), it must cover either (3,6) or (6,9). We are guaranteed to find (3,6) or (6,9) because (3,6) is covered by our second guess.\n\nThus, by guessing the squares in the order (1, 3, 5, 7, 9), we are guaranteed to find at least one covered square. Therefore, the minimum number of turns required is \\(\\boxed{5}\\)."

            "To determine the area of the region defined by the inequality \\( | | x | - 1 | + | | y | - 1 | \\le 1 \\), we need to analyze the expression step by step.\n\nFirst, let's rewrite the inequality in a more manageable form. Define \\( u = |x| \\) and \\( v = |y| \\). The inequality then becomes:\n\\[ |u - 1| + |v - 1| \\le 1. \\]\n\nThis inequality describes a diamond (or rhombus) in the \\(uv\\)-plane centered at \\((1,1)\\) with side length 2. To see why, consider the different cases for the absolute values:\n\n1. If \\( u \\ge 1 \\) and \\( v \\ge 1 \\), then \\( |u-1| = u-1 \\) and \\( |v-1| = v-1 \\), so the inequality becomes \\( (u-1) + (v-1) \\le 1 \\) or \\( u + v \\le 3 \\).\n2. If \\( u \\ge 1 \\) and \\( v < 1 \\), then \\( |u-1| = u-1 \\) and \\( |v-1| = 1-v \\), so the inequality becomes \\( (u-1) + (1-v) \\le 1 \\) or \\( u - v \\le 1 \\).\n3. If \\( u < 1 \\) and \\( v \\ge 1 \\), then \\( |u-1| = 1-u \\) and \\( |v-1| = v-1 \\), so the inequality becomes \\( (1-u) + (v-1) \\le 1 \\) or \\( v - u \\le 1 \\).\n4. If \\( u < 1 \\) and \\( v < 1 \\), then \\( |u-1| = 1-u \\) and \\( |v-1| = 1-v \\), so the inequality becomes \\( (1-u) + (1-v) \\le 1 \\) or \\( u + v \\ge 1 \\).\n\nThese four cases describe a diamond centered at \\((1,1)\\) with vertices at \\((2,1)\\), \\((1,2)\\), \\((0,1)\\), and \\((1,0)\\).\n\nNow, we need to translate this back to the \\(xy\\)-plane. The vertices \\((2,1)\\), \\((1,2)\\), \\((0,1)\\), and \\((1,0)\\) in the \\(uv\\)-plane correspond to the points \\((2,1)\\), \\((1,2)\\), \\((-2,-1)\\), and \\((-1,-2)\\) in the \\(xy\\)-plane. The region in the \\(xy\\)-plane is a square with side length 2 centered at the origin.\n\nThe area of this square is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 2 = 4. \\]\n\nThus, the area of the region in the coordinate plane defined by \\( | | x | - 1 | + | | y | - 1 | \\le 1 \\) is \\(\\boxed{4}\\)."
