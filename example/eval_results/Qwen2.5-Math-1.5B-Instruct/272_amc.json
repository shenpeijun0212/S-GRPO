However, since the greater number must be at least \\(2\\) times the lesser number, the possible greater numbers are \\(2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14\\). This gives us the pairs \\((1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8), (1, 9), (1, 10), (1, 11), (1, 12), (1, 13), (1, 14)\\).\n- If the lesser number in a pair is \\(2\\), the greater number can be \\(4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14\\).

However, since we have already used all the numbers from 1 to 14, we need to re-evaluate the possible pairs.\n\nThe correct approach is to use the fact that the pairs must be formed in a specific order. The number of ways to form these pairs is the number of ways to arrange the numbers in a specific order, which is given by the number of ways to arrange 7 pairs, which is \\(7!\\).\n\nTherefore, the number of ways to split the integers \\(1\\) through \\(14\\) into \\(7\\) pairs such that in each pair, the greater number is at least \\(2\\) times the lesser number is \\(\\boxed{1}\\)."

            "To solve for the positive integer \\( n \\) given the conditions, we start by analyzing the least common multiple (LCM) and the greatest common divisor (GCD) conditions.\n\nFirst, we know that the LCM of \\( n \\) and 18 is 180. The prime factorizations are:\n\\[ 18 = 2 \\cdot 3^2 \\]\n\\[ 180 = 2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5 \\]\nThe LCM of two numbers is the product of the highest powers of all prime factors present in either number. Therefore, \\( n \\) must include the factor \\( 2^2 \\) (since 18 only has \\( 2^1 \\) and the LCM has \\( 2^2 \\)), the factor \\( 5 \\) (since 18 does not have 5 and the LCM does), and can have at most \\( 3^2 \\) (since 18 already has \\( 3^2 \\)). So, we can write:\n\\[ n = 2^2 \\cdot 3^a \\cdot 5 \\cdot k \\]\nwhere \\( a \\leq 2 \\) and \\( k \\) is an integer that does not contain the prime factors 2, 3, or 5.\n\nNext, we use the GCD condition. The GCD of \\( n \\) and 45 is 15. The prime factorizations are:\n\\[ 45 = 3^2 \\cdot 5 \\]\n\\[ 15 = 3 \\cdot 5 \\]\nThe GCD of two numbers is the product of the lowest powers of all prime factors present in both numbers. Therefore, \\( n \\) must include the factor \\( 3 \\) and \\( 5 \\), and cannot include the factor \\( 2 \\) (since the GCD does not include 2). So, we can write:\n\\[ n = 3^b \\cdot 5 \\cdot m \\]\nwhere \\( b \\geq 1 \\) and \\( m \\) is an integer that does not contain the prime factors 3 or 5.\n\nCombining the two conditions, we see that \\( n \\) must be of the form:\n\\[ n = 2^2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 = 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 = 60 \\]\nWe need to verify that this \\( n \\) satisfies both conditions:\n1.

The GCD of 60 and 45 is:\n\\[ \\text{GCD}(60, 45) = \\text{GCD}(2^2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5, 3^2 \\cdot 5) = 3 \\cdot 5 = 15 \\]\nBoth conditions are satisfied, so \\( n = 60 \\).\n\nFinally, the sum of the digits of 60 is:\n\\[ 6 + 0 = 6 \\]\nThus, the answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{6} \\]"

Assume the square is positioned such that one of its vertices is at \\((x,0)\\) on the bottom side of the rectangle, another vertex is at \\((8,y)\\) on the right side of the rectangle, and the third vertex is at \\((8-x,4)\\) on the top side of the rectangle.

Substituting \\(x_0 = 1\\), we get:\n\\[7(1 + 2x_1) \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4} \\implies 7 + 14x_1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4} \\implies 3 + 2x_1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4} \\implies 2x_1 \\equiv -2 \\pmod{4} \\implies 2x_1 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{4} \\implies x_1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}\\]\nSo, \\(x_1 = 1\\).\n\nFor \\(n=3\\):\n\\[S_3 = x_0 + x_1 \\cdot 2 + x_2 \\cdot 4\\]\nWe need \\(7S_3 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{8}\\). Substituting \\(x_0 = 1\\) and \\(x_1 = 1\\), we get:\n\\[7(1 + 2 + 4x_2) \\equiv 1 \\pmod{8} \\implies 7(3 + 4x_2) \\equiv 1 \\pmod{8} \\implies 21 + 28x_2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{8} \\implies 5 + 4x_2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{8} \\implies 4x_2 \\equiv -4 \\pmod{8} \\implies 4x_2 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{8} \\implies x_2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}\\]\nSo, \\(x_2 = 1\\).\n\nWe observe that \\(x_n = 1\\) for all \\(n\\). To confirm, we can use induction. Assume \\(x_k = 1\\) for all \\(k < n\\). Then:\n\\[S_n = 1 + 2 + 4 + \\cdots + 2^{n-1} = 2^n - 1\\]\nWe need \\(7S_n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2^n}\\):\n\\[7(2^n - 1) \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2^n} \\implies 7 \\cdot 2^n - 7 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2^n} \\implies -7 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2^n} \\implies 7 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{2^n} \\implies 7 \\equiv 2^n - 1 \\pmod{2^n}\\]\nThis is true, so our assumption is correct. Therefore, \\(x_n = 1\\) for all \\(n\\).\n\nNow, we need to find the value of \\(x_{2019} + 2x_{2020} + 4x_{2021} + 8x_{2022}\\):\n\\[x_{2019} + 2x_{2020} + 4x_{2021} + 8x_{2022} = 1 + 2 \\cdot 1 + 4 \\cdot 1 + 8 \\cdot 1 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 = 15\\]\n\nThus, the value is \\(\\boxed{15}\\)."

            "Let's denote the number of left-handed players by \\( L \\) and the number of right-handed players by \\( R \\). According to the problem, there are twice as many right-handed players as left-handed players, so we have:\n\\[ R = 2L. \\]\n\nThe total number of players in the tournament is \\( L + R = L + 2L = 3L \\). The total number of games played in a round-robin tournament where each player plays every other player exactly once is given by the combination formula \\( \\binom{n}{2} \\), where \\( n \\) is the total number of players. Therefore, the total number of games played is:\n\\[ \\binom{3L}{2} = \\frac{3L(3L-1)}{2}. \\]\n\nNext, let's denote the number of games won by right-handed players by \\( W_R \\) and the number of games won by left-handed players by \\( W_L \\). According to the problem, the number of games won by left-handed players is 40% more than the number of games won by right-handed players, so we have:\n\\[ W_L = 1.4 W_R. \\]\n\nSince every game has a winner, the total number of games played is equal to the sum of the games won by right-handed players and left-handed players:\n\\[ W_R + W_L = W_R + 1.4 W_R = 2.4 W_R. \\]\nThus, we have:\n\\[ \\frac{3L(3L-1)}{2} = 2.4 W_R. \\]\nSolving for \\( W_R \\), we get:\n\\[ W_R = \\frac{3L(3L-1)}{4.8} = \\frac{5L(3L-1)}{8}. \\]\n\nSince \\( W_R \\) must be an integer, \\( 5L(3L-1) \\) must be divisible by 8. We need to find the smallest positive integer \\( L \\) that satisfies this condition. Let's test some values of \\( L \\):\n\n1. If \\( L = 1 \\), then \\( 5L(3L-1) = 5 \\cdot 1 \\cdot (3 \\cdot 1 - 1) = 5 \\cdot 2 = 10 \\), which is not divisible by 8.\n2.

The total number of games played is:\n\\[ \\binom{9}{2} = \\frac{9 \\cdot 8}{2} = 36. \\]\n\nThus, the total number of games played is:\n\\[ \\boxed{36}. \\]"

            "To solve the problem, we need to understand the structure of a regular icosahedron and the distances between its vertices.

The distance \\(d(A, B)\\) between two vertices \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) is the minimum number of edges one must traverse to connect them.\n\nThe possible values for \\(d(A, B)\\) are 1, 2, 3, and 4.

First, we count the number of pairs \\((Q, R)\\) and \\((R, S)\\) for each possible distance.\n\nThe total number of ways to choose 3 distinct vertices from 12 is \\(\\binom{12}{3} \\cdot 6 = 220 \\cdot 6 = 1320\\), because there are 12 choices for the first vertex, 11 for the second, and 10 for the third, and we divide by 6 because the order of selection does not matter.\n\nNext, we count the number of pairs \\((Q, R)\\) and \\((R, S)\\) such that \\(d(Q, R) > d(R, S)\\). We can use symmetry and the fact that the distances are equally likely to be 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Multiplying this by 243 (a 3-digit number) will result in a number that is 16 + 3 - 1 = 18 digits long. The subtraction of 1 is because the product of a 16-digit number and a 3-digit number can be a 17-digit number at most, but in this case, it will be a 18-digit number because 243 is not a multiple of 10.\n\nTherefore, the number of digits in the base-ten representation of \\(8^5 \\cdot 5^{10} \\cdot 15^5\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{19}\n\\]"

            "To determine the probability that Janet's running total equals 3 at some point during her four rolls of a standard 6-sided die, we need to consider all possible sequences of rolls and identify those sequences where the running total reaches 3 at some point.\n\nFirst, let's list the possible sequences of rolls that result in a running total of 3. The running total can be 3 if the last roll is a 3, or if the running total before the last roll is 1 or 2 and the last roll is 2 or 1, respectively. We will consider each case separately.\n\n1. **Case 1: The last roll is 3.**\n   - The first three rolls can be any combination of 1, 2, 4, 5, or 6. There are \\(5^3 = 125\\) such sequences.\n\n2. **Case 2: The running total before the last roll is 1 or 2.**\n   - If the running total before the last roll is 1, the last roll must be 2. The first two rolls can be any combination of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. There are \\(6^2 = 36\\) such sequences.\n   - If the running total before the last roll is 2, the last roll must be 1.

The sum of the numerator and the denominator is:\n\\[197 + 1296 = 1493.\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\\boxed{1493}.\\]"

        "output":[
            "To determine how many dates in 2023 will have each digit appearing an even number of times in the 8-digit display, we need to analyze the structure of the date format, which is YMMDD, where Y is the year, M is the month, and D is the day.\n\nThe year 2023 has the digits 2, 0, 2, and 3. The month M can be any digit from 01 to 12, and the day D can be any digit from 01 to 31, depending on the month. We need to ensure that each digit in the 8-digit number YMMDD appears an even number of times.\n\nFirst, let's consider the digits in the year 2023. The digits are 2, 0, 2, and 3. For the entire 8-digit number to have each digit appearing an even number of times, the digits M and D must contribute an even number of each digit that is not already present in the year. Specifically, the digit 0 must appear an even number of times, the digit 2 must appear an even number of times, and the digit 3 must appear an even number of times.\n\nSince the digit 0 is already present twice in the year, M and D must together contribute an even number of 0s. This means that M and D must either both be 0 or both be non-zero digits that contribute an even number of 0s in total. However, since M ranges from 01 to 12, it can only be 0 or a non-zero digit. If M is 0, then D must be a non-zero digit that contributes an even number of 0s, which is not possible since D ranges from 01 to 31 and can only be a non-zero digit. Therefore, M must be a non-zero digit, and D must be a non-zero digit that contributes an even number of 0s in total.\n\nNow, let's consider the digit 2. The digit 2 is already present twice in the year, so M and D must together contribute an even number of 2s. This means that M and D must either both be 2 or both be non-2 digits that contribute an even number of 2s in total. However, since M ranges from 01 to 12, it can only be 2 or a non-2 digit. If M is 2, then D must be a non-2 digit that contributes an even number of 2s, which is not possible since D ranges from 01 to 31 and can only be a non-2 digit. Therefore, M must be a non-2 digit, and D must be a non-2 digit that contributes an even number of 2s in total.\n\nFinally, let's consider the digit 3. The digit 3 is already present once in the year, so M and D must together contribute an even number of 3s. This means that M and D must either both be 3 or both be non-3 digits that contribute an even number of 3s in total. However, since M ranges from 01 to 12, it can only be 3 or a non-3 digit. If M is 3, then D must be a non-3 digit that contributes an even number of 3s, which is not possible since D ranges from 01 to 31 and can only be a non-3 digit. Therefore, M must be a non-3 digit, and D must be a non-3 digit that contributes an even number of 3s in total.\n\nThe only way to satisfy all these conditions is if M is 02, 04, 06, 08, or 10, and D is 02, 04, 06, 08, or 10. This gives us 5 possible values for M and 5 possible values for D, but we need to ensure that the total number of each digit is even.

            "To find the maximum area of an isosceles trapezoid with legs of length 1 and one base twice as long as the other, we start by defining the lengths of the bases. Let the lengths of the bases be \\(a\\) and \\(2a\\). We need to find the height of the trapezoid, which we will denote as \\(h\\).\n\nFirst, we drop perpendiculars from the endpoints of the shorter base \\(a\\) to the longer base \\(2a\\). These perpendiculars will divide the longer base into three segments: two segments of length \\(x\\) (the legs of the right triangles formed) and one segment of length \\(a\\) (the shorter base).

Using the Pythagorean theorem, we get:\n\\[1^2 = \\left(\\frac{a}{2}\\right)^2 + h^2 \\implies 1 = \\frac{a^2}{4} + h^2 \\implies h^2 = 1 - \\frac{a^2}{4} \\implies h = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{a^2}{4}}.\\]\n\nThe area \\(A\\) of the trapezoid is given by the formula:\n\\[A = \\frac{1}{2} \\times (a + 2a) \\times h = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 3a \\times \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{a^2}{4}} = \\frac{3a}{2} \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{a^2}{4}}.\\]\n\nTo maximize the area, we need to maximize the function \\(A(a) = \\frac{3a}{2} \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{a^2}{4}}\\). Let \\(f(a) = \\frac{3a}{2} \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{a^2}{4}}\\).

            "To determine the value of \\( x \\) in Coinland, we need to find the largest amount of money that cannot be formed using the given coin values of 6, 10, and 15 cents. This problem can be approached using the concept of the Frobenius coin problem, which deals with finding the largest number that cannot be expressed as a non-negative integer combination of given coin values.\n\nFirst, we note that the coin values are 6, 10, and 15. We will use the fact that for two coprime integers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), the largest number that cannot be expressed as a non-negative integer combination of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) is given by \\( ab - a - b \\). However, since we have three coin values, we need to consider the problem more carefully.\n\nWe start by checking if any two of the coin values are coprime. The greatest common divisor (gcd) of 6 and 10 is 2, so they are not coprime. The gcd of 6 and 15 is 3, so they are not coprime. The gcd of 10 and 15 is 5, so they are not coprime. Since none of the pairs are coprime, we need to use a different approach.\n\nWe will use the fact that the largest number that cannot be formed using three coin values can be found by checking the numbers that cannot be formed and identifying the largest one. We will start by checking the numbers that can be formed and then identify the largest number that cannot be formed.\n\nWe will use a systematic approach to check the numbers that can be formed:\n- Using only 6 and 10, we can form 6, 10, 12, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, etc.\n- Using 6 and 15, we can form 6, 15, 12, 21, 18, 27, 24, 33, etc.\n- Using 10 and 15, we can form 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, etc.\n\nNow, we will check the numbers that cannot be formed:\n- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11, 13, 14, 16, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 32, 34, 37, 38, 39, 41, 43, 44, 46, 47, 49, 53, 59, 61, 62, 64, 67, 68, 69, 71, 73, 74, 76, 77, 79, 83, 89, 91, 92, 94, 97, 98, 99, 101, 103, 104, 106, 107, 109, 113, 119, 121, 122, 124, 127, 128, 129, 131, 133, 134, 136, 137, 139, 143, 149, 151, 152, 154, 157, 158, 159, 161, 163, 164, 166, 167, 169, 173, 179, 181, 182, 184, 187, 188, 189, 191, 193, 194, 196, 197, 199, 203, 209, 211, 212, 214, 217, 218, 219, 221, 223, 224, 226, 227, 229, 233, 239, 241, 242, 244, 247, 248, 249, 251, 253, 254, 256, 257, 259, 263, 269, 271, 272, 274, 277, 278, 279, 281, 283, 284, 286, 287, 289, 293, 299, 301, 302, 304, 307, 308, 309, 311, 313, 314, 316, 317, 319, 323, 329, 331, 332, 334, 337, 338, 339, 341, 343, 344, 346, 347, 349, 353, 359, 361, 362, 364, 367, 368, 369, 371, 373, 374, 376, 377, 379, 383, 389, 391, 392, 394, 397, 398, 399, 401, 403, 404, 406, 407, 409, 413, 419, 421, 422, 424, 427, 428, 429, 431, 433, 434, 436, 437, 439, 443, 449, 451, 452, 454, 457, 458, 459, 461, 463, 464, 466, 467, 469, 473, 479, 481, 482, 484, 487, 488, 489, 491, 493, 494, 496, 497, 499, 503, 509, 511, 512, 514, 517, 518, 519, 521, 523, 524, 526, 527, 529, 533, 539, 541, 542, 544, 547, 548, 549, 551, 553, 554, 556, 557, 559, 563, 569, 571, 572, 574, 577, 578, 579, 581, 583, 584, 586, 587, 589, 593, 599, 601, 602, 604, 607, 608, 609, 611, 613, 614, 616, 617, 619, 623, 629, 631, 632, 634, 637, 638, 639, 641, 643, 644, 646, 647, 649, 653, 659, 661, 662, 664, 667, 668, 669, 671, 673, 674, 676, 677, 679, 683, 689, 691, 692, 694, 697, 698, 699, 701, 703, 704, 706, 707, 709, 713, 719, 721, 722, 724, 727, 728, 729, 731, 733, 734, 736, 737, 739, 743, 749, 751, 752, 754, 757, 758, 759, 761, 763, 764, 766, 767, 769, 773, 779, 781, 782, 784, 787, 788, 789, 791, 793, 794, 796, 797, 799, 803, 809, 811, 812, 814, 817, 818, 819, 821, 823, 824, 826, 827, 829, 833, 839, 841, 842, 844, 847, 848, 849, 851, 853, 854, 856, 857, 859, 863, 869, 871, 872, 874, 877, 878, 879, 881, 883, 884, 886, 887, 889, 893, 899, 901, 902, 904, 907, 908, 909, 911, 913, 914, 916, 917, 919, 923, 929, 931, 932, 934, 937, 938, 939, 941, 943, 944, 946, 947, 949, 953, 959, 961, 962, 964, 967, 968, 969, 971, 973, 974, 976, 977, 979, 983, 989, 991, 992, 994, 997, 998, 999, 1001, 1003, 1004, 1006, 1007, 1009, 1013, 1019, 1021, 1022, 1024, 1027, 1028, 1029, 1031, 1033, 1034, 1036, 1037, 1039, 1043, 1049, 1051, 1052, 1054, 1057, 1058, 1059, 1061, 1063, 1064, 1066, 1067, 1069, 1073, 1079, 1081, 1082, 1084, 1087, 1088, 1089, 1091, 1093, 1094, 1096, 1097, 1099, 1103, 1109, 1111, 1112, 1114, 1117, 1118, 1119, 1121, 1123, 1124, 1126, 1127, 1129, 1133, 1139, 1141, 1142, 1144, 1147, 1148, 1149, 1151, 1153, 1154, 1156, 1157, 1159, 1163, 1169, 1171, 1172, 1174, 1177, 1178, 1179, 1181, 1183, 1184, 1186, 1187, 1189, 1193, 1199, 1201, 1202, 1204, 1207, 1208, 1209, 1211, 1213, 1214, 1216, 1217, 1219, 1223, 1229, 1231, 1232, 1234, 1237, 1238, 1239, 1241, 1243, 1244, 1246, 1247, 1249, 1253, 1259, 1261, 1262, 1264, 1267, 1268, 1269, 1271, 1273, 1274, 1276, 1277, 1279, 1283, 1289, 1291, 1292, 1294, 1297, 1298, 1299, 1301, 1303, 1304, 1306, 1307, 1309, 1313, 1319, 1321, 1322, 1324, 1327, 1328, 1329, 1331, 1333, 1334, 1336, 1337, 1339, 1343, 1349, 1351, 1352, 1354, 1357, 1358, 1359, 1361, 1363, 1364, 1366, 1367, 1369, 1373, 1379, 1381, 1382, 1384, 1387, 1388, 1389, 1391, 1393, 1394, 1396, 1397, 1399, 1403, 1409, 1411, 1412, 1414, 1417, 1418, 1419, 1421, 1423, 1424, 1426, 1427, 14"

The rectangle can be placed either horizontally or vertically. If placed horizontally, it can cover any of the following pairs of squares: (1,2), (2,3), (4,5), (5,6), (7,8), (8,9). If placed vertically, it can cover any of the following pairs of squares: (1,4), (2,5), (3,6), (4,7), (5,8), (6,9).\n\nThere are 6 possible horizontal placements and 6 possible vertical placements, giving us a total of 12 possible placements for the rectangle.\n\nTo ensure that we cover at least one square of the rectangle, we need to consider the worst-case scenario where the rectangle is placed in such a way that it avoids our guesses as long as possible. We can use a strategy of guessing squares in a way that maximizes the number of squares we need to guess before we are guaranteed to find a covered square.\n\nOne effective strategy is to guess the squares in a way that covers all possible placements of the rectangle. If we guess the squares in the following order: (1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9), we can ensure that we will always find a covered square within these 7 guesses.
