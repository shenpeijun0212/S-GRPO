The weight of a number is the number of 1's in its binary representation.\n\nFirst, consider the binary representation of numbers from 0 to \\(2^{2017} - 1\\). Each of these numbers can be represented as a 2017-bit binary number (with leading zeros allowed). The number \\(2^{2017}\\) itself is represented as a 1 followed by 2017 zeros, which has an odd weight of 1.\n\nThe total number of 2017-bit binary numbers is \\(2^{2017}\\). Half of these numbers will have an even weight and the other half will have an odd weight. This is because for any given 2016-bit binary number, there is exactly one way to append a 0 to make the weight even and one way to append a 1 to make the weight odd. Therefore, the number of 2017-bit binary numbers with even weight is \\(2^{2016}\\) and the number of 2017-bit binary numbers with odd weight is also \\(2^{2016}\\).\n\nNow, we need to consider the number \\(2^{2017}\\) itself.

A regular \\( 2n \\)-gon can be described by the vertices \\( (x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), \\ldots, (x_{2n}, y_{2n}) \\) which are symmetrically distributed around the origin. The key property is that the vertices are equally spaced, and the polynomial \\( f \\) must be zero if and only if the points form a regular \\( 2n \\)-gon or are all equal.\n\nTo find the smallest possible degree of \\( f \\), we need to consider the symmetry and the number of variables involved. The polynomial \\( f \\) must be zero if the points are the vertices of a regular \\( 2n \\)-gon, and it must be non-zero for any other configuration of points. This means that \\( f \\) must be a polynomial that captures the symmetry of the regular \\( 2n \\)-gon.\n\nThe number of variables in \\( f \\) is \\( 4n \\), which means we have \\( 2n \\) \\( x \\)-coordinates and \\( 2n \\) \\( y \\)-coordinates. The polynomial \\( f \\) must be zero if the points form a regular \\( 2n \\)-gon, and it must be non-zero for any other configuration of points.

The simplest polynomial that can capture this condition is a polynomial of degree \\( 2n \\) that is zero when the points are the vertices of a regular \\( 2n \\)-gon. This polynomial can be constructed using the symmetric functions of the coordinates of the points, and it will have degree \\( 2n \\).\n\nTherefore, the smallest possible degree of \\( f \\) is \\( 2n \\).\n\nThe answer is \\(\\boxed{2n}\\)."

Given the steps above, it is clear that \\( f(x) = 2x \\) is the only solution.\n\nThus, the only function \\( f: \\mathbb{R}^{+} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{+} \\) that satisfies the given functional equation is\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{f(x) = 2x}.\n\\]"

Clearly, \\( r + b = n \\).\n\nFor each color (red or blue), the number of ordered triples \\((x, y, z)\\) where \\( x, y, z \\) are of the same color and \\( x + y + z \\equiv 0 \\pmod{n} \\) is given by the sum of the number of such triples for red elements and the number of such triples for blue elements. Since the coloring is arbitrary, we can assume without loss of generality that we are counting the number of triples for red elements and then doubling the result (since the number of red and blue elements are symmetric).\n\nThe number of ordered triples \\((x, y, z)\\) where \\( x, y, z \\) are red and \\( x + y + z \\equiv 0 \\pmod{n} \\) is given by the sum of \\( \\sum_{x \\in R} \\sum_{y \\in R} \\sum_{z \\in R} \\mathbf{1}_{x + y + z \\equiv 0 \\pmod{n}} \\), where \\( R \\) is the set of red elements.

Therefore, the number of such triples is \\( r^2 \\cdot \\frac{n}{r} = nr \\) if \\( r \\) divides \\( n \\), and similarly for blue elements.\n\nSince we are counting the number of triples for both red and blue elements, the total number of ordered triples is \\( 2nr \\) if \\( r \\) divides \\( n \\). We are given that this number is 2007, so we have:\n\\[ 2nr = 2007. \\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[ nr = \\frac{2007}{2}. \\]\nSince \\( n \\) and \\( r \\) are integers, \\( \\frac{2007}{2} \\) must be an integer, which implies that \\( n \\) must be even. The prime factorization of 2007 is \\( 3^2 \\cdot 223 \\), so \\( \\frac{2007}{2} = 1003.5 \\), which is not an integer. However, we need to consider the possibility that \\( r \\) is not necessarily an integer but a divisor of \\( n \\). The correct interpretation is that \\( n \\) must be a divisor of 2007, and since 2007 is odd, \\( n \\) must be odd. The only odd divisor of 2007 is 223, so we have:\n\\[ n = 223. \\]\nThen, we have:\n\\[ r = \\frac{2007}{2 \\cdot 223} = \\frac{2007}{446} = 4.5, \\]\nwhich is not an integer.

The correct factorization is:\n\\[ 2007 = 3^2 \\cdot 223, \\]\nand the only odd divisor is 223. Therefore, the correct value of \\( n \\) is:\n\\[ \\boxed{223}. \\]"

Since \\( p \\) is a prime, this implies that \\( f(2) \\) is either 0 or \\( f(1) \\) (if \\( f(1) \\neq 0 \\)). However, since \\( f \\) maps to positive integers, \\( f(2) \\neq 0 \\).

Therefore, by induction, \\( f(n) = f(1) \\) for all \\( n \\in \\mathbb{N} \\).\n\n### Step 3: Check the surjectivity condition\nSince \\( f \\) is surjective, \\( f(1) \\) must be a positive integer.

This implies that each subset \\( A_i \\) must be able to generate all sums from 15 upwards by summing distinct pairs of its elements.\n\nWe start by examining the smallest possible values for \\( n \\). For \\( n = 15 \\), we need to find two distinct elements in each subset \\( A_i \\) that sum to 15. The pairs that sum to 15 are \\((1, 14), (2, 13), (3, 12), (4, 11), (5, 10), (6, 9), (7, 8)\\).

If we have \\( k \\) subsets, each subset can be used to generate sums from 15 upwards by summing distinct pairs of its elements. The key is to ensure that each subset can generate all sums from 15 upwards without overlap in the pairs used.\n\nWe can use a combinatorial approach to determine the maximum \\( k \\). If we have \\( k \\) subsets, each subset can be used to generate sums from 15 upwards by summing distinct pairs of its elements. The maximum \\( k \\) is determined by the number of distinct pairs that sum to 15, which is 7.

This is because the turns do not change the effective distance traveled by the ants in terms of the number of unit squares they move.\n\n3. **Simplifying the Problem:**\n   - Consider the checkerboard as a grid of unit squares. Each ant starts at the midpoint of a unit square and moves in one of the four directions: up, down, left, or right.\n   - The maximum distance an ant can travel before falling off the checkerboard is \\(m - \\frac{1}{2}\\) unit squares in any direction, because the ant starts at the midpoint of a unit square and the checkerboard has \\(m\\) rows and \\(m\\) columns.\n\n4. **Calculating the latest possible moment:**\n   - The latest possible moment at which the last ant falls off the checkerboard is when the ant that travels the maximum distance, which is \\(m - \\frac{1}{2}\\) unit squares, falls off.\n   - Since the speed of each ant is 1 unit per unit time, the time taken for the ant to travel \\(m - \\frac{1}{2}\\) unit squares is \\(m - \\frac{1}{2}\\) units of time.\n\nTherefore, the latest possible moment at which the last ant falls off the checkerboard is \\(\\boxed{m - \\frac{1}{2}}\\)."

We need to find the smallest \\( M \\) such that any selection of \\( M \\) flags guarantees that we can find \\( N \\) flags that can be arranged into an \\( N \\times N \\) square with all fields on the main diagonal of the same color.\n\nWe can use the pigeonhole principle to solve this problem. Consider the \\( N \\) fields on the main diagonal of the \\( N \\times N \\) square. Each field can be either yellow or blue, so there are \\( 2^N \\) possible colorings for the main diagonal. If we have \\( M = 2^N + 1 \\) flags, by the pigeonhole principle, at least two of these flags must have the same coloring for the main diagonal. However, this does not necessarily guarantee that we can find \\( N \\) flags that can be arranged into an \\( N \\times N \\) square with all fields on the main diagonal of the same color.\n\nTo ensure that we can always find \\( N \\) flags that can be arranged into an \\( N \\times N \\) square with all fields on the main diagonal of the same color, we need to consider the worst-case scenario. In the worst case, we might have \\( N-1 \\) flags for each possible coloring of the main diagonal, and one additional flag that is different from all of these. This means we have \\( N \\times (2^{N-1}) + 1 = 2^N - 1 + 1 = 2^N \\) flags, but we need one more to ensure that we can always find \\( N \\) flags that can be arranged into an \\( N \\times N \\) square with all fields on the main diagonal of the same color.\n\nTherefore, the smallest \\( M \\) that guarantees the existence of \\( N \\) flags that can be arranged into an \\( N \\times N \\) square with all fields on the main diagonal of the same color is \\( M = 2^N + 1 \\).\n\nThus, the answer is \\(\\boxed{2^N + 1}\\)."

This is a classic problem in combinatorial design, specifically related to the construction of a 100 by 100 grid where each row and each column has exactly 25 kings, and no two kings are adjacent.\n\nFirst, let's consider the structure of the solution. We can use a known result from combinatorial design theory, specifically the construction of a 100 by 100 grid where each row and each column has exactly 25 kings, and no two kings are adjacent. This is a special case of a more general problem known as the \"N-king problem\" or \"N-king problem on a chessboard.\"\n\nThe solution to this problem is known to be based on a specific type of combinatorial design called a \"balanced incomplete block design\" (BIBD) or a \"resolvable BIBD.\" However, for the specific case of a \\(100 \\times 100\\) grid with 25 kings per row and per column, the solution is known to be based on a specific type of arrangement called a \"\u7acb\u5373 balanced incomplete block design\" (IBD).\n\nThe number of such arrangements is given by the number of ways to partition the \\(100 \\times 100\\) grid into 100 rows and 100 columns, each containing exactly 25 kings, such that no two kings are adjacent. This is a highly complex combinatorial problem, and the exact number of such arrangements is not easily computed without the use of advanced combinatorial techniques or computational methods.\n\nHowever, the problem statement asks for the number of such arrangements, and the answer is known to be:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{0}\n\\]\n\nThis is because it is impossible to place 2500 kings on a \\(100 \\times 100\\) chessboard such that no two kings are adjacent and each row and each column contains exactly 25 kings. This is a known result in combinatorial design theory, and the proof involves showing that such an arrangement would require a specific type of combinatorial structure that does not exist for a \\(100 \\times 100\\) grid with the given constraints."

            "To solve the problem, we need to understand the structure of the dissection and the properties of the diagonals and triangles involved. Let's start by analyzing the properties of the diagonals and the triangles formed in the dissection.\n\n1. **Understanding the Diagonals:**\n   - A diagonal of a regular 2006-gon is called odd if its endpoints divide the boundary into two parts, each composed of an odd number of sides. This means that if we label the vertices of the 2006-gon as \\(A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_{2006}\\), a diagonal \\(A_iA_j\\) is odd if both \\(i-j\\) and \\(2006 - (i-j)\\) are odd. This is equivalent to saying that \\(i-j\\) is odd.\n   - Sides of the 2006-gon are also considered as odd diagonals.\n\n2. **Properties of Isosceles Triangles:**\n   - An isosceles triangle with two odd sides must have its base as an even side (a side of the 2006-gon) and its two equal sides as odd diagonals. This is because the sum of two odd numbers is even, and the sum of an odd number and an even number is odd.\n\n3. **Counting the Isosceles Triangles:**\n   - In a dissection of a regular 2006-gon into triangles, each triangle has either two odd sides or two even sides. Since we are interested in isosceles triangles with two odd sides, we need to count how many such triangles can be formed.\n   - Each vertex of the 2006-gon is part of exactly two triangles in the dissection. If we consider the structure of the dissection, each vertex will be the apex of exactly one isosceles triangle with two odd sides. This is because the dissection is such that each triangle is formed by two odd diagonals and one side of the 2006-gon, and each vertex is shared by exactly two such triangles.\n   - Since there are 2006 vertices in the 2006-gon, and each vertex is the apex of exactly one isosceles triangle with two odd sides, the maximum number of such isosceles triangles is 1003. This is because each isosceles triangle with two odd sides is counted twice (once for each of its two odd sides), so we need to divide the total count by 2.\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible number of isosceles triangles with two odd sides is \\(\\boxed{1003}\\)."

The only divisor of 1 is 1 itself, and \\( 1 \\) is a perfect square. So, \\( n = 1 \\) satisfies the condition.\n\nNext, let's consider the case where \\( n \\) has exactly two divisors. The only number with exactly two divisors is a prime number \\( p \\). The divisors are 1 and \\( p \\). We need to check if there is a permutation of these divisors such that the sum of the first \\( i \\) divisors is a perfect square for \\( i = 1, 2 \\). The only permutation is \\( (1, p) \\) or \\( (p, 1) \\). For \\( (1, p) \\), \\( 1 \\) is a perfect square, but \\( 1 + p \\) is not a perfect square unless \\( p = 3 \\) (since \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\) is a perfect square).

So, \\( n = 3 \\) satisfies the condition.\n\nNow, let's consider the case where \\( n \\) has more than two divisors. Suppose \\( n \\) has at least three divisors. Let's denote the divisors of \\( n \\) as \\( d_1, d_2, \\ldots, d_k \\) where \\( d_1 = 1 \\) and \\( d_k = n \\). We need to check if there is a permutation of these divisors such that the sum of the first \\( i \\) divisors is a perfect square for \\( i = 1, 2, \\ldots, k \\). \n\nConsider the smallest prime factor \\( p \\) of \\( n \\). The divisors of \\( n \\) include 1 and \\( p \\). If \\( n \\) has more than two divisors, then \\( n \\) must be of the form \\( p^a \\) or \\( p^a q^b \\) where \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) are distinct primes. However, for \\( n \\) to have the property that the sum of the first \\( i \\) divisors is a perfect square, the divisors must be carefully chosen. For example, if \\( n = p^2 \\), the divisors are \\( 1, p, p^2 \\). We need to check if there is a permutation of these divisors such that the sum of the first \\( i \\) divisors is a perfect square for \\( i = 1, 2, 3 \\). The only permutation is \\( (1, p, p^2) \\) or \\( (p^2, p, 1) \\). For \\( (1, p, p^2) \\), \\( 1 \\) is a perfect square, \\( 1 + p \\) is not a perfect square, and \\( 1 + p + p^2 \\) is not a perfect square unless \\( p = 3 \\) (since \\( 1 + 3 + 9 = 13 \\) is not a perfect square).

So, \\( n = 9 \\) satisfies the condition.\n\nBy similar analysis, we can see that for \\( n \\) to have more than two divisors and satisfy the condition, \\( n \\) must be of the form \\( p^2 \\) where \\( p \\) is a prime number. Therefore, the only positive integers \\( n \\) that satisfy the given property are \\( n = 1 \\) and \\( n = p^2 \\) where \\( p \\) is a prime number.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{1 \\text{ and all squares of prime numbers}}\n\\]"

There are three orientations of \\( n \\times n \\times 1 \\) boxes: along the \\( x \\)-axis, \\( y \\)-axis, and \\( z \\)-axis. Each orientation gives us \\( n \\) sets of colors. The problem states that each set of colors in one orientation must appear in both of the other orientations. This implies a high degree of symmetry and repetition in the coloring of the cube.\n\nTo maximize the number of colors, we need to consider how the colors can be distributed. Let's denote the colors by \\( C_1, C_2, \\ldots, C_k \\). Each \\( n \\times n \\times 1 \\) box in any orientation must contain a subset of these colors, and the same subset must appear in both of the other orientations.\n\nOne way to achieve this is to color the cube such that each \\( n \\times n \\times 1 \\) box in any orientation contains exactly the same set of colors. This can be done by coloring the cube in a checkerboard-like pattern, but extended to three dimensions. Specifically, we can color the cube such that each \\( n \\times n \\times 1 \\) box contains exactly the same set of colors, and this set is the same for all \\( n \\times n \\times 1 \\) boxes in all three orientations.\n\nTo achieve this, we can use a coloring scheme where each \\( n \\times n \\times 1 \\) box contains exactly \\( n \\) different colors. This can be done by coloring the cube in a way that each layer of \\( n \\times n \\) is colored with \\( n \\) different colors, and the colors in each layer are shifted in a way that the same set of colors appears in all \\( n \\times n \\times 1 \\) boxes in all three orientations.\n\nThe maximum number of colors that can be present in the cube is \\( n \\). This is because each \\( n \\times n \\times 1 \\) box must contain exactly \\( n \\) different colors, and this set of colors must be the same for all \\( n \\times n \\times 1 \\) boxes in all three orientations. Therefore, the maximal possible number of colors that are present is \\( n \\).\n\nThus, the answer is \\(\\boxed{n}\\)."

The sum of all divisors of \\( n \\) is denoted by \\( \\sigma(n) \\). If we can arrange the divisors of \\( n \\) into a rectangular table where the sums of the rows and columns are equal, then the total sum of all divisors, \\( \\sigma(n) \\), must be divisible by both the number of rows and the number of columns. This means that \\( \\sigma(n) \\) must be divisible by the product of the number of rows and columns, which is \\( d(n) \\).\n\nLet's consider the possible values of \\( d(n) \\). The number of divisors \\( d(n) \\) of \\( n \\) can be written in the form \\( (e_1+1)(e_2+1)\\cdots(e_k+1) \\) if \\( n = p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} \\cdots p_k^{e_k} \\) is the prime factorization of \\( n \\). For \\( \\sigma(n) \\) to be divisible by \\( d(n) \\), \\( n \\) must be a perfect square.

For \\( n = 1 \\), the only divisor is 1, and we can form a \\( 1 \\times 1 \\) table. The sum of the row and the sum of the column are both 1, so it works.\n2. For \\( n = 4 \\), the divisors are 1, 2, and 4. We can form a \\( 1 \\times 3 \\) or \\( 3 \\times 1 \\) table, but these do not satisfy the condition of equal row and column sums. However, we can form a \\( 2 \\times 2 \\) table with the divisors 1, 2, 2, and 4, where the sum of each row and each column is 3. So, it works.\n3. For \\( n = 9 \\), the divisors are 1, 3, and 9. We can form a \\( 1 \\times 3 \\) or \\( 3 \\times 1 \\) table, but these do not satisfy the condition of equal row and column sums. However, we can form a \\( 3 \\times 3 \\) table with the divisors 1, 3, 3, 9, where the sum of each row and each column is 15. So, it works.\n4. For \\( n = 16 \\), the divisors are 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16. We can form a \\( 1 \\times 5 \\) or \\( 5 \\times 1 \\) table, but these do not satisfy the condition of equal row and column sums. However, we can form a \\( 5 \\times 1 \\) table with the divisors 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16, where the sum of each row and each column is 31.

One effective way to do this is to mark cells in a checkerboard pattern, but we need to ensure that the marking does not allow for multiple valid tilings. Instead, we can mark cells in a way that forces a specific tiling pattern.\n\nLet's mark the cells in the first row and the first column, but not the top-left cell. This means we mark \\( 2n - 1 \\) cells in the first row and \\( 2n - 1 \\) cells in the first column, but we do not mark the cell at the intersection of the first row and the first column.

This means that the tiling is forced to be a specific pattern, where each row and each column alternates between marked and unmarked cells, and the only way to cover the board is to follow this alternating pattern.\n\nTo see why this is the smallest possible \\( k \\), consider that if we mark fewer than \\( 4n - 2 \\) cells, there will be at least one row or one column with more than one marked cell, which would allow for multiple valid tilings.

            "To find all functions \\( f: \\mathbb{N} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{N} \\) such that for all positive integers \\( m \\) and \\( n \\), the integer \\( f(m) + f(n) - mn \\) is nonzero and divides \\( m f(m) + n f(n) \\), we start by analyzing the given condition. Specifically, we need \\( f(m) + f(n) - mn \\) to divide \\( m f(m) + n f(n) \\).\n\nFirst, let's consider the case when \\( m = n \\). The condition becomes:\n\\[ f(m) + f(m) - m^2 \\mid m f(m) + m f(m) \\]\nwhich simplifies to:\n\\[ 2f(m) - m^2 \\mid 2m f(m). \\]\nThis implies that \\( 2f(m) - m^2 \\) must divide \\( 2m f(m) \\). Let's denote \\( d = 2f(m) - m^2 \\). Then \\( d \\mid 2m f(m) \\), and we can write:\n\\[ 2m f(m) = k d \\]\nfor some integer \\( k \\). Substituting \\( d = 2f(m) - m^2 \\) into the equation, we get:\n\\[ 2m f(m) = k (2f(m) - m^2). \\]\nRearranging terms, we have:\n\\[ 2m f(m) = 2k f(m) - k m^2 \\]\n\\[ 2m f(m) - 2k f(m) = -k m^2 \\]\n\\[ f(m) (2m - 2k) = -k m^2. \\]\nSince \\( f(m) \\) is a positive integer, \\( 2m - 2k \\) must be negative, implying \\( k > m \\). Let's test some small values of \\( m \\) to find a pattern.\n\nFor \\( m = 1 \\), the condition becomes:\n\\[ f(1) + f(n) - n \\mid f(1) + n f(n). \\]\nLet \\( f(1) = c \\). Then:\n\\[ c + f(n) - n \\mid c + n f(n). \\]\nThis implies:\n\\[ c + f(n) - n \\mid c + n f(n) - n(c + f(n) - n) = c + n f(n) - nc - nf(n) + n^2 = n^2 - nc + c. \\]\nSo:\n\\[ c + f(n) - n \\mid n^2 - nc + c. \\]\nFor \\( n = 1 \\), we get:\n\\[ c + f(1) - 1 \\mid 1 - c + c \\]\n\\[ c + c - 1 \\mid 1 \\]\n\\[ 2c - 1 \\mid 1. \\]\nThe only positive integer \\( c \\) that satisfies this is \\( c = 1 \\). So, \\( f(1) = 1 \\).\n\nNow, let's assume \\( f(n) = n \\) and check if it satisfies the original condition. If \\( f(n) = n \\), then:\n\\[ f(m) + f(n) - mn = m + n - mn. \\]\nWe need to check if \\( m + n - mn \\) divides \\( m f(m) + n f(n) = m^2 + n^2 \\). Notice that:\n\\[ m + n - mn = m + n(1 - m). \\]\nFor \\( m = 1 \\), we have:\n\\[ 1 + n - n = 1 \\mid 1 + n^2, \\]\nwhich is true. For \\( m = 2 \\), we have:\n\\[ 2 + n - 2n = 2 - n \\mid 4 + n^2. \\]\nIf \\( n = 2 \\), then:\n\\[ 2 - 2 = 0 \\mid 4 + 4, \\]\nwhich is true. For general \\( m \\) and \\( n \\), we need to check the divisibility condition, but the pattern suggests that \\( f(n) = n \\) is a solution. To confirm, we need to show that \\( f(n) = n \\) is the only solution. Assume there is another function \\( g(n) \\) that satisfies the condition. Then for \\( m = n \\), we have:\n\\[ g(m) + g(m) - m^2 \\mid 2m g(m), \\]\nwhich simplifies to:\n\\[ 2g(m) - m^2 \\mid 2m g(m). \\]\nThis implies \\( g(m) = m \\), so \\( f(n) = n \\) is the only solution.\n\nThus, the only function \\( f: \\mathbb{N} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{N} \\) that satisfies the given condition is:\n\\[ \\boxed{f(n) = n}. \\]"

            "To determine the number of cookies that player \\( A \\) receives if both players play optimally, we need to analyze the game and the conditions under which the game terminates.

The game terminates when either one of the numbers on the blackboard is larger than the sum of all other numbers, or when there are only zeros on the blackboard.\n\nFirst, let's consider the sum of the numbers on the blackboard. Initially, the sum is \\( 2020 \\times 1 = 2020 \\). Each time player \\( B \\) writes either \\( x+y \\) or \\( |x-y| \\), the sum of the numbers on the blackboard remains unchanged because \\( x+y = x+y \\) and \\( |x-y| = x-y \\) or \\( y-x \\), which are both equal to the sum of the original numbers \\( x \\) and \\( y \\). Therefore, the sum of the numbers on the blackboard is always 2020.\n\nNow, let's analyze the conditions under which the game terminates:\n1. One of the numbers on the blackboard is larger than the sum of all other numbers.\n2. There are only zeros on the blackboard.\n\nFor the first condition to hold, one of the numbers on the blackboard must be greater than 2019 (since the sum of all other numbers is 2020 minus the number itself). For the second condition to hold, all numbers on the blackboard must be zero. However, since the sum of the numbers is always 2020, it is impossible for all numbers to be zero (because the sum of zeros is zero, not 2020).\n\nTherefore, the only way the game can terminate is if one of the numbers on the blackboard is greater than 2019. This means that player \\( A \\) wants to force the game to end with one of the numbers being greater than 2019. Player \\( B \\) wants to prevent this from happening by ensuring that the numbers on the blackboard never reach a point where one of them is greater than 2019.\n\nTo achieve this, player \\( B \\) can always choose to write \\( |x-y| \\) instead of \\( x+y \\). This ensures that the numbers on the blackboard will never become too large. Specifically, if player \\( A \\) erases two numbers \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) and player \\( B \\) writes \\( |x-y| \\), the maximum value of \\( |x-y| \\) will be less than or equal to the maximum of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\). By always choosing \\( |x-y| \\), player \\( B \\) can ensure that the numbers on the blackboard never become too large.\n\nSince the game must terminate, and the only way for the game to terminate is if one of the numbers on the blackboard is greater than 2019, player \\( A \\) will always be able to force the game to end with one of the numbers being greater than 2019. Therefore, player \\( A \\) will always receive the maximum number of cookies, which is the number of numbers on the blackboard when the game terminates.\n\nSince the game must end with one of the numbers being greater than 2019, the number of numbers on the blackboard when the game terminates will be 2020 (because the sum of the numbers is always 2020, and one of the numbers is greater than 2019, so the other numbers must sum to less than 1, which is not possible with positive integers).\n\nTherefore, the number of cookies that player \\( A \\) receives is \\(\\boxed{2020}\\)."

Each pair of walls intersects at a unique point, and at each intersection, there is a door connecting the two diagonally opposite corners where sides of different colors meet. This means that the labyrinth is divided into regions, and each region is a polygon with vertices at the intersection points of the walls.\n\nThe key observation is that the problem of placing knights such that no two knights can meet is equivalent to finding the maximum number of regions that are completely separated from each other. This is because each region can be considered a \"(area of influence\" for a knight, and knights in different regions cannot meet because they are in different connected components of the labyrinth.\n\nThe number of regions created by \\( n \\) walls in a plane, where no two walls are parallel and no three walls intersect at the same point, is given by the formula:\n\\[\nR(n) = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2} + 1\n\\]\nThis formula can be derived by noting that each new wall intersects all previous walls, creating new regions.

In the worst-case scenario, where the walls are painted in such a way that the regions are as connected as possible, the maximum number of knights that can be placed is the number of regions minus the number of walls, because each wall can separate at most one region from the rest.\n\nThus, the maximum number of knights that can be placed is:\n\\[\nk(\\mathfrak{L}) = n + 1\n\\]\nThis is because each wall can separate at most one region from the rest, and there are \\( n \\) walls, plus the initial region before any walls are built.\n\nTherefore, the value of \\( k(\\mathfrak{L}) \\) for a labyrinth with \\( n \\) walls is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{n+1}\n\\]"

Let \\(\\mathcal{F} = \\{0, 1, 2, \\ldots, 2^k - 1\\}\\). For any \\(x \\in \\mathcal{F}\\), the possible values of \\(|x-y|\\) for \\(y \\in \\mathcal{F}\\) are the integers from 1 to \\(2^k - 1\\). The scale \\(D(x, y)\\) is determined by the exponent of the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to \\(|x-y|\\). Since \\(|x-y|\\) ranges from 1 to \\(2^k - 1\\), the possible scales are the integers from 0 to \\(k-1\\). Therefore, each \\(x \\in \\mathcal{F}\\) has exactly \\(k\\) different scales, which satisfies the given condition.\n\nTo see that this is the maximum possible size, note that if \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) had more than \\(2^k\\) elements, then by the pigeonhole principle, at least one of the scales would have to be used more than \\(k\\) times, which would violate the condition that each \\(x\\) has at most \\(k\\) different scales. Therefore, the maximum possible size of \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) is \\(2^k\\).\n\nThus, the maximum possible size of \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) is \\(\\boxed{2^k}\\)."

Here, \\(\\mho(n)\\) is defined as the number of prime factors of \\( n \\) greater than \\( 10^{100} \\), counted with multiplicity.\n\nFirst, let's consider the implications of the inequality \\(\\mho(f(a) - f(b)) \\leq \\mho(a - b)\\). This inequality suggests that the function \\( f \\) should not introduce new prime factors greater than \\( 10^{100} \\) in the difference \\( f(a) - f(b) \\) that are not already present in \\( a - b \\). This is a strong constraint on the form of \\( f \\).\n\nLet's analyze the function \\( f \\) by considering some specific cases. Suppose \\( f \\) is a linear function of the form \\( f(x) = cx + d \\) where \\( c \\) and \\( d \\) are integers and \\( c > 1 \\) (since \\( f \\) is strictly increasing). Then, for any integers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) with \\( a > b \\), we have:\n\\[ f(a) - f(b) = c(a - b). \\]\nThe number of prime factors of \\( f(a) - f(b) \\) greater than \\( 10^{100} \\) is the same as the number of prime factors of \\( c \\) greater than \\( 10^{100} \\) multiplied by the number of prime factors of \\( a - b \\) greater than \\( 10^{100} \\). Therefore, we have:\n\\[ \\mho(f(a) - f(b)) = \\mho(c) + \\mho(a - b). \\]\nFor the inequality \\(\\mho(f(a) - f(b)) \\leq \\mho(a - b)\\) to hold, we must have:\n\\[ \\mho(c) + \\mho(a - b) \\leq \\mho(a - b), \\]\nwhich simplifies to:\n\\[ \\mho(c) \\leq 0. \\]\nSince \\(\\mho(c)\\) is the number of prime factors of \\( c \\) greater than \\( 10^{100} \\), the only way this can be true is if \\( c = 1 \\). However, \\( c = 1 \\) does not satisfy the condition that \\( f \\) is strictly increasing. Therefore, \\( c \\) must be a prime number greater than \\( 10^{100} \\).\n\nNow, let's consider the case where \\( f \\) is a prime power function of the form \\( f(x) = p^x \\) where \\( p \\) is a prime number greater than \\( 10^{100} \\). For any integers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) with \\( a > b \\), we have:\n\\[ f(a) - f(b) = p^a - p^b = p^b(p^{a-b} - 1). \\]\nThe number of prime factors of \\( f(a) - f(b) \\) greater than \\( 10^{100} \\) is the same as the number of prime factors of \\( p^{a-b} - 1 \\) greater than \\( 10^{100} \\) (since \\( p^b \\) is a power of a prime greater than \\( 10^{100} \\)). Therefore, we have:\n\\[ \\mho(f(a) - f(b)) = \\mho(p^{a-b} - 1). \\]\nFor the inequality \\(\\mho(f(a) - f(b)) \\leq \\mho(a - b)\\) to hold, we must have:\n\\[ \\mho(p^{a-b} - 1) \\leq \\mho(a - b). \\]\nThis inequality is satisfied because \\( p^{a-b} - 1 \\) is a number that is composed of prime factors that are less than or equal to \\( p \\), and since \\( p \\) is a prime number greater than \\( 10^{100} \\), the number of prime factors of \\( p^{a-b} - 1 \\) greater than \\( 10^{100} \\) is less than or equal to the number of prime factors of \\( a - b \\) greater than \\( 10^{100} \\).\n\nTherefore, the only strictly increasing functions \\( f: \\mathbb{Z} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{Z} \\) that satisfy the given condition are the functions of the form \\( f(x) = p^x \\) where \\( p \\) is a prime number greater than \\( 10^{100} \\). The answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{f(x) = p^x \\text{ for any prime } p > 10^{100}}\n\\]"

            "To find the least possible constant \\( c \\) such that for every positive integer \\( n \\), for every collection of \\( n \\) real numbers, and for every possible sequence that George might obtain, the resulting values satisfy the inequality \\( G \\leqslant c D \\), we need to analyze the strategies of Dave and George.\n\nFirst, let's understand the strategies:\n- Dave's strategy is to minimize the maximum absolute sum of any prefix of the sequence. This means he will try to balance the sums of the prefix sums as much as possible.\n- George's strategy is to minimize the absolute sum of the prefix sums at each step. He will choose each \\( x_i \\) to minimize the absolute value of the sum of the first \\( i \\) terms.\n\nWe need to show that George's price \\( G \\) is at most a constant multiple of Dave's minimum price \\( D \\).\n\nConsider the sequence \\( x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n \\). Let \\( S_i = x_1 + x_2 + \\cdots + x_i \\) be the sum of the first \\( i \\) terms. Dave's minimum price \\( D \\) is given by:\n\\[ D = \\max_{1 \\leq i \\leq n} |S_i|. \\]\n\nGeorge's price \\( G \\) is given by:\n\\[ G = \\max_{1 \\leq i \\leq n} |S_i|. \\]\n\nHowever, George's strategy is to minimize the absolute sum at each step, so he might not always achieve the same maximum absolute sum as Dave. To find the constant \\( c \\), we need to consider the worst-case scenario for George's strategy.\n\nConsider the sequence \\( x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n \\) where \\( x_i = (-1)^i \\). For this sequence, the partial sums are:\n\\[ S_1 = -1, \\quad S_2 = 0, \\quad S_3 = -1, \\quad S_4 = 0, \\quad \\ldots, \\quad S_{2k-1} = -1, \\quad S_{2k} = 0. \\]\nThe maximum absolute sum for this sequence is 1, so \\( D = 1 \\).\n\nNow, let's see what George's sequence might be. George will choose the terms to minimize the absolute sum at each step. If he starts with \\( x_1 = -1 \\), then he will choose \\( x_2 = 1 \\) to make the sum zero. For the next term, he will choose \\( x_3 = -1 \\) to make the sum \\(-1\\). He will continue this pattern, alternating between \\(-1\\) and \\(1\\). This sequence will have the same maximum absolute sum as Dave's sequence, so \\( G = 1 \\).\n\nHowever, consider a different sequence where the terms are more spread out. For example, let \\( x_1 = 1, x_2 = -2, x_3 = 3, x_4 = -4, \\ldots, x_n = (-1)^{n+1} n \\). The partial sums are:\n\\[ S_1 = 1, \\quad S_2 = -1, \\quad S_3 = 2, \\quad S_4 = -2, \\quad \\ldots, \\quad S_{2k-1} = k, \\quad S_{2k} = -k. \\]\nThe maximum absolute sum for this sequence is \\( k \\), so \\( D = k \\).\n\nNow, let's see what George's sequence might be. George will choose the terms to minimize the absolute sum at each step. If he starts with \\( x_1 = 1 \\), then he will choose \\( x_2 = -2 \\) to make the sum \\(-1\\). For the next term, he will choose \\( x_3 = 3 \\) to make the sum 2. He will continue this pattern, alternating between positive and negative terms. This sequence will have a maximum absolute sum of \\( k \\), so \\( G = k \\).\n\nTherefore, in the worst case, \\( G \\) can be as large as \\( D \\), so the least possible constant \\( c \\) is 2. This is because in the worst case, \\( G \\) can be twice the maximum absolute sum of the prefix sums, but it cannot be more than twice the maximum absolute sum of the prefix sums.\n\nThus, the least possible constant \\( c \\) is:\n\\[ \\boxed{2} \\]"

If \\( f(x) = \\frac{1}{x} \\), then the inequality becomes\n\n\\[\nx f(y) + y f(x) = x \\cdot \\frac{1}{y} + y \\cdot \\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{x}{y} + \\frac{y}{x}.\n\\]\n\nWe need to check if there exists a unique \\( y \\) such that\n\n\\[\n\\frac{x}{y} + \\frac{y}{x} \\leq 2.\n\\]\n\nUsing the AM-GM inequality, we have\n\n\\[\n\\frac{x}{y} + \\frac{y}{x} \\geq 2,\n\\]\n\nwith equality if and only if \\( \\frac{x}{y} = \\frac{y}{x} \\), which implies \\( x = y \\). Therefore, the only \\( y \\) that satisfies the inequality is \\( y = x \\), and it is unique. This shows that \\( f(x) = \\frac{1}{x} \\) is indeed a solution.\n\nNow, we need to show that this is the only solution. Suppose there exists another function \\( g \\) that satisfies the given condition. Then for every \\( x \\in \\mathbb{R}_{>0} \\), there exists a unique \\( y \\in \\mathbb{R}_{>0} \\) such that\n\n\\[\nx g(y) + y g(x) \\leq 2.\n\\]\n\nIf \\( g(x) < \\frac{1}{x} \\) for some \\( x \\), then we can find a \\( y \\) such that\n\n\\[\nx g(y) + y g(x) < x \\cdot \\frac{1}{y} + y \\cdot g(x) < 2,\n\\]\n\nwhich contradicts the uniqueness of \\( y \\). Similarly, if \\( g(x) > \\frac{1}{x} \\) for some \\( x \\), then we can find a \\( y \\) such that\n\n\\[\nx g(y) + y g(x) > x \\cdot \\frac{y}{x} + y \\cdot \\frac{1}{y} = y + y = 2y > 2,\n\\]\n\nwhich again contradicts the condition. Therefore, the only function that satisfies the given condition is\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{x}}.\n\\]"

Here's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Initial Strategy for the Gardener:**\n   The gardener can start by choosing a single square and increasing the height of that square and its surrounding squares by 1 unit. This will ensure that the height of these 9 squares (the center square and its 8 neighbors) is at least 1 unit.

After \\( 10^{12} \\) turns, the height of each of these \\( 10^{12} \\) squares will be at least \\( 10^{12} \\) units, which is more than \\( 10^6 \\) units.\n\nTherefore, the largest number \\( K \\) such that the gardener can ensure there are eventually \\( K \\) most symples on the board is \\( 10^{12} \\).\n\nThe answer is \\(\\boxed{10^{12}}\\)."

Additionally, \\( f \\) satisfies the condition that if \\( f(x_1, y_1) > f(x_2, y_2) \\), then \\( f(x_1 + 1, y_1) > f(x_2 + 1, y_2) \\) and \\( f(x_1, y_1 + 1) > f(x_2, y_2 + 1) \\). This condition implies that \\( f \\) is strictly increasing in both coordinates.\n\nGiven that \\( f \\) is a bijection, it must map the set \\(\\{0, 1, 2, \\ldots, 99\\} \\times \\{0, 1, 2, \\ldots, 99\\}\\) to the set \\(\\{0, 1, 2, \\ldots, 9900\\}\\). The number of odd integers in \\(\\{0, 1, 2, \\ldots, 9900\\}\\) is 4951 (since half of the numbers in this range are odd, and we round up for the higher end).\n\nSince \\( f \\) is a bijection, it must map exactly half of the pairs \\((x, y)\\) to odd values and the other half to even values. Therefore, the number of pairs \\((x, y)\\) such that \\( f(x, y) \\) is odd is exactly half of the total number of pairs, which is \\( \\frac{100 \\times 100}{2} = 5000 \\).\n\nThus, the smallest and largest possible value of \\( N \\) is the same, and it is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{5000}\n\\]"

However, \\(a^p\\) must be a power of \\(a\\) and \\(1 + p\\) is not a power of any integer for \\(p \\geq 3\\). Therefore, there is no solution for \\(b = 1\\).\n- If \\(b = 2\\), then \\(b! = 2\\), so \\(a^p = 2 + p\\). Since \\(p \\geq 3\\), \\(a^p \\geq 8\\), so \\(a \\geq 2\\). However, \\(a^p\\) must be a power of \\(a\\) and \\(2 + p\\) is not a power of any integer for \\(p \\geq 3\\). Therefore, there is no solution for \\(b = 2\\).\n- If \\(b = 3\\), then \\(b! = 6\\), so \\(a^p = 6 + p\\). Since \\(p \\geq 3\\), \\(a^p \\geq 32\\), so \\(a \\geq 3\\). However, \\(a^p\\) must be a power of \\(a\\) and \\(6 + p\\) is not a power of any integer for \\(p \\geq 3\\). Therefore, there is no solution for \\(b = 3\\).\n- If \\(b = 4\\), then \\(b! = 24\\), so \\(a^p = 24 + p\\). Since \\(p \\geq 3\\), \\(a^p \\geq 64\\), so \\(a \\geq 4\\). However, \\(a^p\\) must be a power of \\(a\\) and \\(24 + p\\) is not a power of any integer for \\(p \\geq 3\\). Therefore, there is no solution for \\(b = 4\\).\n- If \\(b = 5\\), then \\(b! = 120\\), so \\(a^p = 120 + p\\). Since \\(p \\geq 3\\), \\(a^p \\geq 256\\), so \\(a \\geq 6\\). However, \\(a^p\\) must be a power of \\(a\\) and \\(120 + p\\) is not a power of any integer for \\(p \\geq 3\\). Therefore, there is no solution for \\(b = 5\\).\n- If \\(b = 6\\), then \\(b! = 720\\), so \\(a^p = 720 + p\\). Since \\(p \\geq 3\\), \\(a^p \\geq 3125\\), so \\(a \\geq 15\\). However, \\(a^p\\) must be a power of \\(a\\) and \\(720 + p\\) is not a power of any integer for \\(p \\geq 3\\). Therefore, there is no solution for \\(b = 6\\).\n\nFor \\(b \\geq 7\\), \\(b!\\) is divisible by \\(p\\), so \\(b! + p \\equiv p \\pmod{p}\\). Since \\(a^p \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p}\\), \\(a^p \\equiv p \\pmod{p}\\) is not possible for \\(p \\geq 3\\). Therefore, there are no solutions for \\(b \\geq 7\\).\n\nThus, the only solution is \\((a, b, p) = (2, 2, 2)\\).\n\nThe final answer is\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{(2, 2, 2)}.\n\\]"

Since \\( f(x) \\neq 0 \\) for all \\( x \\in \\mathbb{Q}_{>0} \\), we can divide both sides by \\( f(x)^2 \\) to get \\( f(a) = f(b) \\). Therefore, \\( f \\) is injective.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the form of \\( f \\)\nSet \\( y = 1 \\) in \\((*)\\):\n\n\\[\nf(x^2 f(1)^2) = f(x)^2 f(1).\n\\]\n\nUsing \\( f(1) = c \\), we get:\n\n\\[\nf(x^2 c^2) = c f(x)^2.\n\\]\n\nNow, let's set \\( x = 1 \\) in the above equation:\n\n\\[\nf(c^2) = c f(1)^2 = c^3.\n\\]\n\nFrom the equation \\( f(f(y)^2) = c^2 f(y) \\), setting \\( y = c \\), we get:\n\n\\[\nf(f(c)^2) = c^2 f(c).\n\\]\n\nSince \\( f(c) = c^2 \\) (because \\( f \\) is injective and \\( f(c^2) = c^3 \\)), we have:\n\n\\[\nf(c^4) = c^2 c^2 = c^4.\n\\]\n\nWe can generalize this to \\( f(c^{2^n}) = c^{2^{n+1}} \\) for all non-negative integers \\( n \\). This suggests that \\( f(x) = cx \\) might be a solution. Let's verify if \\( f(x) = cx \\) satisfies the original equation. Substituting \\( f(x) = cx \\) into \\((*)\\), we get:\n\n\\[\nf(x^2 (cy)^2) = f(x^2 c^2 y^2) = c x^2 c^2 y^2 = c^3 x^2 y^2,\n\\]\n\nand\n\n\\[\nf(x)^2 f(y) = (cx)^2 (cy) = c^2 x^2 cy = c^3 x^2 y^2.\n\\]\n\nSince both sides are equal, \\( f(x) = cx \\) is indeed a solution. To determine \\( c \\), we note that \\( f(1) = c \\), and from the equation \\( f(f(y)^2) = c^2 f(y) \\), setting \\( y = 1 \\) gives \\( f(c^2) = c^3 \\). Since \\( f(x) = cx \\), we have \\( f(c^2) = c^3 \\), which is consistent. Therefore, \\( c \\) can be any positive rational number, but the simplest and most common solution is \\( c = 1 \\).\n\nThus, the only solution is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{f(x) = x}.\n\\]"

We start by considering the properties of the points and the lines.\n\nFirst, note that the problem can be approached by considering the general case of dividing the plane with lines to separate points of different colors. The key insight is that each line can potentially separate the plane into two regions, and we need to ensure that no region contains both red and blue points.\n\nA useful strategy is to consider the convex hulls of the red and blue points. The convex hull of a set of points is the smallest convex polygon that contains all the points. If we draw a line that separates the convex hulls of the red and blue points, we can ensure that no region contains both colors. However, this approach might not be sufficient if the convex hulls are not well-defined or if the points are distributed in a way that makes it difficult to find a single line to separate them.\n\nTo guarantee that we can always find a way to separate the points, we need to consider the worst-case scenario. The worst-case scenario is when the points are distributed in such a way that no single line can separate them. In this case, we need to draw additional lines to further divide the plane.\n\nThe key observation is that each additional line can potentially create more regions, and we need to ensure that we can always find a way to separate the points.

This means that out of the $k$ steps, exactly $n$ steps must be switches of lamps $1, \\ldots, n$ and the remaining $k-n$ steps must be switches of lamps $n+1, \\ldots, 2n$. Since the order of these switches matters, the number of such sequences is given by the number of ways to choose $n$ positions out of $k$ for the first type of switch, which is $\\binom{k}{n}$. For each of these sequences, the $n$ switches of lamps $1, \\ldots, n$ can be either on or off, and the $k-n$ switches of lamps $n+1, \\ldots, 2n$ can also be either on or off, but since they are already in the desired state, there is only one way to do this. Therefore, the total number of such sequences is $\\binom{k}{n}$.\n\nNext, let's consider the number of $k$-step sequences that end in the same state but do not touch lamps $n+1, \\ldots, 2n$ at all.

The number of such sequences is simply the number of ways to choose $k$ positions out of $k$ for the switches of lamps $1, \\ldots, n$, which is $\\binom{k}{k} = 1$.\n\nThe ratio $N \/ M$ is therefore the ratio of the number of sequences that touch lamps $n+1, \\ldots, 2n$ to the number of sequences that do not touch lamps $n+1, \\ldots, 2n$ at all. Since the number of sequences that touch lamps $n+1, \\ldots, 2n$ is $\\binom{k}{n}$ and the number of sequences that do not touch lamps $n+1, \\ldots, 2n$ at all is 1, the ratio is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{N}{M} = \\frac{\\binom{k}{n}}{1} = \\binom{k}{n}\n\\]\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\binom{k}{n}}\n\\]"

This implies that each domino must be placed such that it is the only domino adjacent to its two cells. This can only happen if each domino is placed in a specific pattern that ensures each cell is adjacent to exactly one domino.\n\nConsider the following pattern: place dominoes in a checkerboard-like pattern, but with a twist. Instead of the usual alternating pattern, we can place dominoes in a way that each domino is surrounded by cells that are not covered by any other domino. One such pattern is to place dominoes in every other row and every other column, but shifted by one cell in the alternating direction.\n\nFor example, for \\(n=2\\), we can place the dominoes as follows:\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|}\n\\hline\nD &   & D &   \\\\\n\\hline\n  & D &   & D \\\\\n\\hline\nD &   & D &   \\\\\n\\hline\n  & D &   & D \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n\\]\nHere, \\(D\\) represents a covered cell, and the empty cells are not covered by any domino. This pattern ensures that each cell is adjacent to exactly one covered cell.\n\nGeneralizing this pattern to a \\(2n \\times 2n\\) board, we can see that we can place dominoes in a similar checkerboard-like pattern, but with the understanding that each domino is placed such that it is the only domino adjacent to its two cells. This pattern allows us to cover \\(2n \\times 2n\\) with \\(2n^2\\) dominoes.\n\nTo verify, note that in a \\(2n \\times 2n\\) board, there are \\(4n^2\\) cells. Since each domino covers 2 cells, the maximum number of dominoes that can be placed is \\(2n^2\\). The pattern we described ensures that this is indeed the maximum number of dominoes that can be placed under the given conditions.\n\nTherefore, the largest number of dominoes that can be placed on a \\(2n \\times 2n\\) board such that every cell is adjacent to exactly one cell covered by a domino is \\(\\boxed{2n^2}\\)."

Mathematically, this can be expressed as:\n\\[ P(\\text{living at least 10 years} | \\text{living at least 5 years}) = \\frac{P(\\text{living at least 10 years})}{P(\\text{living at least 5 years})} \\]\n\nWe know that:\n\\[ P(\\text{living at least 10 years} | \\text{living at least 5 years}) = 0.25 \\]\n\\[ P(\\text{living at least 10 years}) = 0.25 \\]\n\nSo, we can substitute these values into the equation:\n\\[ 0.25 = \\frac{0.25}{P} \\]\n\nSolving for \\(P\\), we get:\n\\[ P = \\frac{0.25}{0.25} = 1 \\]\n\nHowever, this result seems counterintuitive because it implies that an 80 year old person will definitely live at least another 5 years, which is not necessarily true given the information provided. Let's re-evaluate the problem using a different approach.\n\nWe can use the law of total probability to find \\(P\\). The probability that an 80 year old person will live at least another 5 years can be broken down into two cases:\n1. The person lives at least another 10 years.\n2. The person lives between 10 and 15 years.\n\nThe probability of the first case is given as \\(0.25\\). The probability of the second case is the probability of living at least another 5 years minus the probability of living at least another 10 years:\n\\[ P(\\text{living between 10 and 15 years}) = P(\\text{living at least 5 years}) - P(\\text{living at least 10 years}) \\]\n\\[ P(\\text{living between 10 and 15 years}) = P - 0.25 \\]\n\nThe total probability of living at least another 5 years is the sum of the probabilities of these two cases:\n\\[ P(\\text{living at least 5 years}) = P(\\text{living at least 10 years}) + P(\\text{living between 10 and 15 years}) \\]\n\\[ P = 0.25 + (P - 0.25) \\]\n\\[ P = P \\]\n\nThis equation is always true, but it does not help us find \\(P\\) directly. Instead, we need to use the fact that the probability of living at least another 15 years is the probability of living at least another 10 years, given that the person has already lived 5 years:\n\\[ P(\\text{living at least 15 years} | \\text{living at least 5 years}) = \\frac{P(\\text{living at least 15 years})}{P(\\text{living at least 5 years})} \\]\n\\[ 0.20 = \\frac{P(\\text{living at least 15 years})}{P} \\]\n\nWe know that the probability of living at least another 15 years is the probability of living at least another 10 years, given that the person has already lived 5 years, multiplied by the probability of living at least another 5 years given that the person has already lived 10 years:\n\\[ P(\\text{living at least 15 years}) = P(\\text{living at least 10 years} | \\text{living at least 5 years}) \\times P(\\text{living at least 5 years} | \\text{living at least 10 years}) \\]\n\\[ P(\\text{living at least 15 years}) = 0.25 \\times P(\\text{living at least 5 years} | \\text{living at least 10 years}) \\]\n\nWe can substitute this into the equation:\n\\[ 0.20 = \\frac{0.25 \\times P(\\text{living at least 5 years} | \\text{living at least 10 years})}{P} \\]\n\\[ 0.20 = \\frac{0.25 \\times (P - 0.25)}{P} \\]\n\\[ 0.20P = 0.25(P - 0.25) \\]\n\\[ 0.20P = 0.25P - 0.0625 \\]\n\\[ 0.05P = 0.0625 \\]\n\\[ P = \\frac{0.0625}{0.05} \\]\n\\[ P = 1.25 \\]\n\nThis result is not possible because a probability cannot be greater than 1. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate the problem using a different approach.\n\nLet's use the fact that the probability of living at least another 15 years is the probability of living at least another 10 years, given that the person has already lived 5 years, multiplied by the probability of living at least another 5 years given that the person has already lived 10 years:\n\\[ P(\\text{living at least 15 years}) = P(\\text{living at least 10 years} | \\text{living at least 5 years}) \\times P(\\text{living at least 5 years} | \\text{living at least 10 years}) \\]\n\\[ 0.20 = 0.25 \\times P(\\text{living at least 5 years} | \\text{living at least 10 years}) \\]\n\\[ P(\\text{living at least 5 years} | \\text{living at least 10 years}) = \\frac{0.20}{0.25} \\]\n\\[ P(\\text{living at least 5 years} | \\text{living at least 10 years}) = 0.80 \\]\n\nTherefore, the probability that an 80 year old person will live at least another 5 years is:\n\\[ \\boxed{0.80} \\]"

            "To determine the area of \\(\\triangle DEF\\), we first need to find the value of \\(c\\) in the equation of the parabola \\(y = -2x^2 + 4x + c\\). We know that the vertex of the parabola is \\(V(1, 18)\\). The vertex form of a parabola is \\(y = a(x-h)^2 + k\\), where \\((h, k)\\) is the vertex. For the given parabola, the vertex is \\((1, 18)\\), so we can rewrite the equation in vertex form as:\n\\[ y = -2(x-1)^2 + 18. \\]\nExpanding this, we get:\n\\[ y = -2(x^2 - 2x + 1) + 18 = -2x^2 + 4x - 2 + 18 = -2x^2 + 4x + 16. \\]\nBy comparing this with the original equation \\(y = -2x^2 + 4x + c\\), we see that \\(c = 16\\). So the equation of the parabola is:\n\\[ y = -2x^2 + 4x + 16. \\]\n\nNext, we find the y-intercept \\(D\\) by setting \\(x = 0\\):\n\\[ y = -2(0)^2 + 4(0) + 16 = 16. \\]\nSo, the y-intercept is \\(D(0, 16)\\).\n\nTo find the x-intercepts \\(E\\) and \\(F\\), we set \\(y = 0\\) and solve for \\(x\\):\n\\[ -2x^2 + 4x + 16 = 0. \\]\nDividing the entire equation by -2, we get:\n\\[ x^2 - 2x - 8 = 0. \\]\nFactoring the quadratic equation, we get:\n\\[ (x-4)(x+2) = 0. \\]\nSo, the solutions are \\(x = 4\\) and \\(x = -2\\). Therefore, the x-intercepts are \\(E(4, 0)\\) and \\(F(-2, 0)\\).\n\nNow, we have the vertices of \\(\\triangle DEF\\) as \\(D(0, 16)\\), \\(E(4, 0)\\), and \\(F(-2, 0)\\). The base \\(EF\\) of the triangle is the distance between \\(E\\) and \\(F\\), which is:\n\\[ EF = 4 - (-2) = 6. \\]\nThe height of the triangle is the y-coordinate of \\(D\\), which is 16. The area of \\(\\triangle DEF\\) is given by:\n\\[ \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 6 \\times 16 = 48. \\]\nThus, the area of \\(\\triangle DEF\\) is:\n\\[ \\boxed{48}. \\]"

            "To determine the probability that Victor stops with at least 1 red ball and at least 1 green ball on the table, we need to consider the possible scenarios where he stops removing balls.

This means he can stop after removing 2 balls of the same color, and the only way to stop with at least 1 red ball and at least 1 green ball is if he removes 2 red balls or 2 green balls.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of ways to stop after removing 2 balls of the same color. There are two scenarios to consider:\n1. Victor removes 2 red balls.\n2.

So, \\(s_{17} = 8\\).\n\nNow, we need to place the remaining even integers 2, 4, and 6 in the sequence such that between any two equal even integers, there is exactly one odd integer. Let's start by placing the 2's. Since 2 is an even integer, the next 2 must be at position \\(2 + 2 = 4\\), but we already have a 1 at position 4, so the 2's must be placed such that there is exactly one odd integer between them. The possible positions for the 2's are 2, 5, 8, and 11. However, since we already have a 1 at position 4, the 2's must be placed at positions 2, 5, and 8. So, \\(s_2 = 2\\), \\(s_5 = 2\\), and \\(s_8 = 2\\).\n\nNext, we place the 4's. Since 4 is an even integer, the next 4 must be at position \\(4 + 4 = 8\\), but we already have a 2 at position 8, so the 4's must be placed such that there is exactly one odd integer between them. The possible positions for the 4's are 4, 7, and 10. However, since we already have a 2 at position 5, the 4's must be placed at positions 4, 7, and 10. So, \\(s_4 = 4\\), \\(s_7 = 4\\), and \\(s_{10} = 4\\).\n\nFinally, we place the 6's. Since 6 is an even integer, the next 6 must be at position \\(6 + 6 = 12\\), but we need to check the positions available. The possible positions for the 6's are 6, 9, and 12. However, since we already have a 4 at position 7, the 6's must be placed at positions 6, 9, and 12. So, \\(s_6 = 6\\), \\(s_9 = 6\\), and \\(s_{12} = 6\\).\n\nNow, we need to place the remaining odd integers 3, 5, 7, and 9. The possible positions for the 3's are 1, 6, 11, and 15. However, since we already have a 6 at position 12, the 3's must be placed at positions 1, 6, and 11. So, \\(s_1 = 3\\), \\(s_6 = 3\\), and \\(s_{11} = 3\\).\n\nThe possible positions for the 5's are 3, 8, and 15. However, since we already have a 1 at position 3, the 5's must be placed at positions 8 and 15. So, \\(s_8 = 5\\) and \\(s_{15} = 5\\).\n\nThe possible positions for the 7's are 5, 10, and 17. However, since we already have a 8 at position 17, the 7's must be placed at positions 5 and 10. So, \\(s_5 = 7\\) and \\(s_{10} = 7\\).\n\nThe possible positions for the 9's are 7, 12, and 18. However, since we already have a 6 at position 12, the 9's must be placed at positions 7 and 18. So, \\(s_7 = 9\\) and \\(s_{18} = 9\\).\n\nTherefore, the Skolem sequence of order 9 that satisfies all the given conditions is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{(3, 2, 1, 4, 5, 2, 6, 7, 4, 8, 9, 5, 6, 7, 1, 8, 9)}\n\\]"

The largest pairwise sum \\( s_6 = 208 \\) must be the sum of the two largest numbers in the list, i.e., \\( a_3 + a_4 = 208 \\).\n\nThe second smallest pairwise sum \\( s_2 = 104 \\) must be the sum of the smallest number and the third smallest number, i.e., \\( a_1 + a_3 = 104 \\). The second largest pairwise sum \\( s_5 = 112 \\) must be the sum of the largest number and the third largest number, i.e., \\( a_3 + a_4 = 112 \\). However, we already know \\( a_3 + a_4 = 208 \\), so this information is consistent.\n\nNow we have the following system of equations:\n1. \\( a_1 + a_2 = 8 \\)\n2. \\( a_1 + a_3 = 104 \\)\n3. \\( a_3 + a_4 = 208 \\)\n\nWe can solve these equations step by step. First, subtract the first equation from the second:\n\\[ (a_1 + a_3) - (a_1 + a_2) = 104 - 8 \\]\n\\[ a_3 - a_2 = 96 \\]\n\\[ a_3 = a_2 + 96 \\]\n\nNext, substitute \\( a_3 = a_2 + 96 \\) into the third equation:\n\\[ (a_2 + 96) + a_4 = 208 \\]\n\\[ a_2 + a_4 = 112 \\]\n\\[ a_4 = 112 - a_2 \\]\n\nNow we have \\( a_3 = a_2 + 96 \\) and \\( a_4 = 112 - a_2 \\). Substitute \\( a_3 = a_2 + 96 \\) into the second equation:\n\\[ a_1 + (a_2 + 96) = 104 \\]\n\\[ a_1 + a_2 = 8 \\]\n\\[ a_1 = 8 - a_2 \\]\n\nSo the list is \\( (a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4) = (8 - a_2, a_2, a_2 + 96, 112 - a_2) \\). We need to check if this list satisfies all the pairwise sums. The pairwise sums are:\n\\[ a_1 + a_2 = 8 \\]\n\\[ a_1 + a_3 = (8 - a_2) + (a_2 + 96) = 104 \\]\n\\[ a_1 + a_4 = (8 - a_2) + (112 - a_2) = 120 - 2a_2 \\]\n\\[ a_2 + a_3 = a_2 + (a_2 + 96) = 2a_2 + 96 \\]\n\\[ a_2 + a_4 = a_2 + (112 - a_2) = 112 \\]\n\\[ a_3 + a_4 = (a_2 + 96) + (112 - a_2) = 208 \\]\n\nWe need to find \\( a_2 \\) such that the pairwise sums match the given sums. From the list of pairwise sums, we see that \\( 120 - 2a_2 = 106 \\) and \\( 2a_2 + 96 = 110 \\). Solving \\( 120 - 2a_2 = 106 \\):\n\\[ 120 - 106 = 2a_2 \\]\n\\[ 14 = 2a_2 \\]\n\\[ a_2 = 7 \\]\n\nSo, \\( a_1 = 8 - 7 = 1 \\), \\( a_3 = 7 + 96 = 103 \\), and \\( a_4 = 112 - 7 = 105 \\). Therefore, one possible list is \\( (1, 7, 103, 105) \\).\n\nTo verify, the pairwise sums are:\n\\[ 1 + 7 = 8 \\]\n\\[ 1 + 103 = 104 \\]\n\\[ 1 + 105 = 106 \\]\n\\[ 7 + 103 = 110 \\]\n\\[ 7 + 105 = 112 \\]\n\\[ 103 + 105 = 208 \\]\n\nThese match the given sums, so the list is correct. Therefore, one possible list is \\( (1, 7, 103, 105) \\).\n\nTo find another possible list, we can check if there are other values for \\( a_2 \\) that satisfy the conditions. However, since the problem does not specify that the list must be unique, we can conclude that the list \\( (1, 7, 103, 105) \\) is one of the possible lists.\n\nThus, the two possible lists are:\n\\[\n\\boxed{(1, 7, 103, 105)}\n\\]"

Finally, we will calculate the percentage of acid in the remaining mixture.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the amount of acid in each of the original bottles:\n- In bottle A, the amount of acid is \\(40 \\times 0.10 = 4 \\text{ g}\\).\n- In bottle B, the amount of acid is \\(50 \\times 0.20 = 10 \\text{ g}\\).\n- In bottle C, the amount of acid is \\(50 \\times 0.30 = 15 \\text{ g}\\).\n\nThe total amount of acid in the original mixture is \\(4 + 10 + 15 = 30 \\text{ g}\\).\n\nLet's denote the amounts of the mixtures taken from bottles A, B, and C as \\(x \\text{ g}\\), \\(y \\text{ g}\\), and \\(z \\text{ g}\\) respectively. We know that the total mass of the mixture is 60 g, so we have:\n\\[x + y + z = 60.\\]\n\nThe amount of acid in the mixture is 25% of 60 g, so we have:\n\\[0.25 \\times 60 = 15 \\text{ g}.\\]\n\nThis means the amount of acid taken from the original mixtures must satisfy:\n\\[0.10x + 0.20y + 0.30z = 15.\\]\n\nWe now have a system of two equations:\n1. \\(x + y + z = 60\\)\n2. \\(0.10x + 0.20y + 0.30z = 15\\)\n\nWe can simplify the second equation by multiplying through by 10:\n\\[x + 2y + 3z = 150.\\]\n\nNow we have:\n\\[x + y + z = 60\\]\n\\[x + 2y + 3z = 150.\\]\n\nSubtract the first equation from the second:\n\\[(x + 2y + 3z) - (x + y + z) = 150 - 60\\]\n\\[y + 2z = 90.\\]\n\nWe can express \\(y\\) in terms of \\(z\\):\n\\[y = 90 - 2z.\\]\n\nSubstitute \\(y = 90 - 2z\\) into the first equation:\n\\[x + (90 - 2z) + z = 60\\]\n\\[x + 90 - z = 60\\]\n\\[x = z - 30.\\]\n\nNow we have \\(x = z - 30\\) and \\(y = 90 - 2z\\). Since \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) must be non-negative, we need \\(z \\geq 30\\) and \\(z \\leq 45\\) (because if \\(z > 45\\), then \\(y\\) would be negative).\n\nLet's choose \\(z = 30\\):\n\\[x = 30 - 30 = 0,\\]\n\\[y = 90 - 2 \\times 30 = 30.\\]\n\nSo, the amounts of the mixtures taken are \\(x = 0 \\text{ g}\\) from bottle A, \\(y = 30 \\text{ g}\\) from bottle B, and \\(z = 30 \\text{ g}\\) from bottle C. The remaining amounts in the bottles are:\n- Bottle A: \\(40 - 0 = 40 \\text{ g}\\)\n- Bottle B: \\(50 - 30 = 20 \\text{ g}\\)\n- Bottle C: \\(50 - 30 = 20 \\text{ g}\\)\n\nThe total mass of the remaining mixture is \\(40 + 20 + 20 = 80 \\text{ g}\\). The amount of acid in the remaining mixture is:\n\\[0 \\times 0.10 + 30 \\times 0.20 + 30 \\times 0.30 = 0 + 6 + 9 = 15 \\text{ g}.\\]\n\nThe percentage of acid in the new mixture is:\n\\[\\frac{15}{80} \\times 100 = 18.75\\%.\\]\n\nThus, the percentage of the new mixture that is acid is \\(\\boxed{18.75}\\)."

            "To determine how many of the integers \\( f(1), f(2), \\ldots, f(2014) \\) have a units digit of 1, we first need to understand the function \\( f(n) \\).

This is a combinatorial problem that can be solved using the stars and bars method with constraints.\n\n### Step 1: Define the problem in terms of combinatorics\nWe need to find the number of solutions to the equation:\n\\[ x_1 + x_2 + \\cdots + x_n = 5 \\]\nwhere \\( x_i \\) are positive integers (since each digit must be at least 1).\n\n### Step 2: Transform the problem\nTo use the stars and bars method, we transform the variables \\( x_i \\) by setting \\( y_i = x_i - 1 \\). This transforms the equation into:\n\\[ (y_1 + 1) + (y_2 + 1) + \\cdots + (y_n + 1) = 5 \\]\nwhich simplifies to:\n\\[ y_1 + y_2 + \\cdots + y_n = 5 - n \\]\nwhere \\( y_i \\) are non-negative integers.\n\n### Step 3: Apply the stars and bars theorem\nThe number of non-negative integer solutions to the equation \\( y_1 + y_2 + \\cdots + y_n = 5 - n \\) is given by:\n\\[ \\binom{(5 - n) + n - 1}{n - 1} = \\binom{4}{n - 1} \\]\n\n### Step 4: Determine the range of \\( n \\)\nFor \\( f(n) \\) to be non-zero, \\( 5 - n \\geq 0 \\), which implies \\( n \\leq 5 \\).

The die has three odd numbers (1, 3, 8) and three even numbers (2, 4, 6).\n\n### Case 1: The first roll results in an odd number\nIf an odd number appears on the first roll, all the odd numbers on the die are doubled.

We can test small values of \\(n\\) to see if they satisfy this condition. However, a more systematic approach is to check the congruence properties of \\(n\\) modulo 8.\n\nBy testing values of \\(n\\) modulo 8, we find that \\(n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{4}\\) is a solution. This is because:\n\\[\nn^3 + 4n^2 + 5n + 2 \\equiv 2^3 + 4 \\cdot 2^2 + 5 \\cdot 2 + 2 \\equiv 8 + 16 + 10 + 2 \\equiv 36 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{8}\n\\]\nand \\(4 \\cdot 1^2 = 4\\), which is a perfect square. Therefore, \\(n\\) must be of the form \\(n = 4m + 2\\) for some integer \\(m\\).\n\nThe largest \\(n\\) less than 100000 is 99998, and we need to find the number of integers \\(m\\) such that:\n\\[\n4m + 2 \\leq 99998 \\implies 4m \\leq 99996 \\implies m \\leq 24999\n\\]\nSo, \\(m\\) can take any integer value from 0 to 24999, inclusive. Therefore, there are 25000 possible values for \\(m\\).\n\nThe number of positive integers \\(n < 100000\\) for which the length of side \\(BC\\) is also an integer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{25000}\n\\]"

            "To determine the year when both Dan and Steve were both alive and their ages were both perfect squares on April 7, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the possible birth years for Dan and Steve that are perfect squares within their respective ranges.\n2. Calculate their ages on April 7 of each year.\n3. Check if both ages are perfect squares in the same year.\n\nFirst, let's identify the possible birth years for Dan. Dan was born between 1300 and 1400, and his birth year must be a perfect square. The perfect squares in this range are:\n\\[ 1369 = 37^2 \\]\nSo, Dan was born in 1369.\n\nNext, let's identify the possible birth years for Steve. Steve was born between 1400 and 1500, and his birth year must be a perfect square. The perfect squares in this range are:\n\\[ 1444 = 38^2 \\]\nSo, Steve was born in 1444.\n\nNow, let's calculate their ages on April 7 of each year. Dan was born in 1369, so his age on April 7 of year \\( Y \\) is \\( Y - 1369 \\). Steve was born in 1444, so his age on April 7 of year \\( Y \\) is \\( Y - 1444 \\).\n\nWe need to find a year \\( Y \\) such that both \\( Y - 1369 \\) and \\( Y - 1444 \\) are perfect squares. Let's denote these perfect squares by \\( a^2 \\) and \\( b^2 \\) respectively. Therefore, we have:\n\\[ Y - 1369 = a^2 \\]\n\\[ Y - 1444 = b^2 \\]\nSubtracting the first equation from the second, we get:\n\\[ (Y - 1444) - (Y - 1369) = b^2 - a^2 \\]\n\\[ -75 = b^2 - a^2 \\]\n\\[ 75 = a^2 - b^2 \\]\n\\[ 75 = (a - b)(a + b) \\]\n\nWe need to find pairs of factors of 75 that can be expressed as \\( (a - b) \\) and \\( (a + b) \\). The factor pairs of 75 are:\n\\[ (1, 75), (3, 25), (5, 15) \\]\n\nLet's check each pair:\n1. For the pair (1, 75):\n   \\[ a - b = 1 \\]\n   \\[ a + b = 75 \\]\n   Adding these equations, we get:\n   \\[ 2a = 76 \\]\n   \\[ a = 38 \\]\n   Subtracting the first equation from the second, we get:\n   \\[ 2b = 74 \\]\n   \\[ b = 37 \\]\n   So, \\( a = 38 \\) and \\( b = 37 \\). Therefore, \\( Y = a^2 + 1369 = 38^2 + 1369 = 1444 + 1369 = 2813 \\).\n\n2. For the pair (3, 25):\n   \\[ a - b = 3 \\]\n   \\[ a + b = 25 \\]\n   Adding these equations, we get:\n   \\[ 2a = 28 \\]\n   \\[ a = 14 \\]\n   Subtracting the first equation from the second, we get:\n   \\[ 2b = 22 \\]\n   \\[ b = 11 \\]\n   So, \\( a = 14 \\) and \\( b = 11 \\). Therefore, \\( Y = a^2 + 1369 = 14^2 + 1369 = 196 + 1369 = 1565 \\), but 1565 is not in the range for Steve's birth year (1400 to 1500).\n\n3. For the pair (5, 15):\n   \\[ a - b = 5 \\]\n   \\[ a + b = 15 \\]\n   Adding these equations, we get:\n   \\[ 2a = 20 \\]\n   \\[ a = 10 \\]\n   Subtracting the first equation from the second, we get:\n   \\[ 2b = 10 \\]\n   \\[ b = 5 \\]\n   So, \\( a = 10 \\) and \\( b = 5 \\). Therefore, \\( Y = a^2 + 1369 = 10^2 + 1369 = 100 + 1369 = 1469 \\), but 1469 is not in the range for Dan's birth year (1300 to 1400).\n\nThe only valid year is \\( Y = 2813 \\). Let's verify:\n- Dan's age on April 7 of 2813 is \\( 2813 - 1369 = 1444 = 38^2 \\), which is a perfect square.\n- Steve's age on April 7 of 2813 is \\( 2813 - 1444 = 1369 = 37^2 \\), which is a perfect square.\n\nTherefore, the year when both Dan and Steve were both alive and their ages were both perfect squares on April 7 is \\(\\boxed{2813}\\)."

Since the integers are partitioned into three sets with equal sums, we have:\n\n\\[\n3S = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2} \\implies S = \\frac{n(n+1)}{6}\n\\]\n\nFor \\(S\\) to be an integer, \\(n(n+1)\\) must be divisible by 6. Since \\(n\\) and \\(n+1\\) are consecutive integers, one of them is always even, and one of them is always divisible by 3. Therefore, \\(n(n+1)\\) is always divisible by 6, and \\(S\\) is always an integer.\n\nNext, we need to ensure that the sets \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\) can be constructed according to the given conditions. Set \\(A\\) contains only odd numbers, set \\(B\\) contains only even numbers, and set \\(C\\) contains every multiple of 3. Let's analyze the number of elements in each set.\n\nThe number of odd numbers from 1 to \\(n\\) is \\(\\left\\lceil \\frac{n}{2} \\right\\rceil\\), and the number of even numbers from 1 to \\(n\\) is \\(\\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\right\\rfloor\\). The number of multiples of 3 from 1 to \\(n\\) is \\(\\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{3} \\right\\rfloor\\).\n\nFor the sets to be partitioned correctly, the number of elements in each set must be such that they can be divided into three sets with equal sums. This means that the number of elements in each set must be a multiple of 3. Therefore, \\(n\\) must be of the form \\(6k\\) or \\(6k+3\\) for some integer \\(k\\).\n\nLet's check the even numbers less than 100 that fit this form:\n- For \\(n = 6k\\), the even numbers are \\(6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 54, 60, 66, 72, 78, 84, 90, 96\\).\n- For \\(n = 6k+3\\), the even numbers are \\(9, 15, 21, 27, 33, 39, 45, 51, 57, 63, 69, 75, 81, 87, 93, 99\\).\n\nWe need to verify that for each of these values of \\(n\\), the sum \\(S = \\frac{n(n+1)}{6}\\) can be partitioned into three sets with equal sums. This is true for all these values because the conditions for the sets being partitioned are satisfied by the structure of the numbers.\n\nTherefore, the even \"s\u68c0\u67e5\" integers less than 100 are:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 54, 60, 66, 72, 78, 84, 90, 96, 9, 15, 21, 27, 33, 39, 45, 51, 57, 63, 69, 75, 81, 87, 93, 99}\n\\]"

Using these properties, we can rewrite the right-hand side of the equation:\n\n\\[\n2x - \\log_2(3^x) = \\log_2(2^{2x}) - \\log_2(3^x) = \\log_2\\left(\\frac{2^{2x}}{3^x}\\right) = \\log_2\\left(2^x \\cdot 2^x \\cdot \\frac{1}{3^x}\\right) = \\log_2\\left(2^x \\cdot \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^x\\right) = \\log_2\\left(\\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right)^x\\right)\n\\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\log_2\\left(2^{x-1} + 3^{x+1}\\right) = \\log_2\\left(\\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right)^x\\right)\n\\]\n\nSince the logarithm function is one-to-one, we can equate the arguments of the logarithms:\n\n\\[\n2^{x-1} + 3^{x+1} = \\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right)^x\n\\]\n\nNext, we simplify the left-hand side:\n\n\\[\n2^{x-1} + 3^{x+1} = \\frac{2^x}{2} + 3 \\cdot 3^x = \\frac{2^x}{2} + 3^{x+1}\n\\]\n\nSo the equation is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2^x}{2} + 3^{x+1} = \\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right)^x\n\\]\n\nWe can rewrite \\(\\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right)^x\\) as \\(\\frac{4^x}{3^x} = \\frac{(2^2)^x}{3^x} = \\frac{2^{2x}}{3^x}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2^x}{2} + 3^{x+1} = \\frac{2^{2x}}{3^x}\n\\]\n\nTo eliminate the fractions, we multiply every term by \\(2 \\cdot 3^x\\):\n\n\\[\n2^x \\cdot 3^x + 2 \\cdot 3^{x+1} \\cdot 3^x = 2^{2x} \\cdot 2\n\\]\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n\\[\n2^x \\cdot 3^x + 2 \\cdot 3^{2x+1} = 2^{2x+1}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n2^x \\cdot 3^x + 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 3^{2x} = 2 \\cdot 2^{2x}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n2^x \\cdot 3^x + 6 \\cdot 3^{2x} = 2 \\cdot 2^{2x}\n\\]\n\nLet \\( y = 2^x \\) and \\( z = 3^x \\).

Therefore, we have:\n\n\\[\n2^x = 2 \\cdot 3^x\n\\]\n\nDividing both sides by \\( 3^x \\), we get:\n\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^x = 2\n\\]\n\nTaking the logarithm base 2 of both sides, we get:\n\n\\[\nx \\log_2\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right) = 1\n\\]\n\nSince \\(\\log_2\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right) = \\log_2(2) - \\log_2(3) = 1 - \\log_2(3)\\), we have:\n\n\\[\nx (1 - \\log_2(3)) = 1\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( x \\), we get:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{1}{1 - \\log_2(3)}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{2}\n\\]"

            "To determine the possible values for the area of a right-angled triangle with one side length equal to 60 and with side lengths forming an arithmetic sequence, we start by letting the side lengths of the triangle be \\(a-d\\), \\(a\\), and \\(a+d\\), where \\(a\\) is the middle term and \\(d\\) is the common difference. Since the triangle is right-angled, the side lengths must satisfy the Pythagorean theorem. There are two cases to consider: either \\(a-d\\) and \\(a\\) are the legs, or \\(a\\) and \\(a+d\\) are the legs.\n\n**Case 1: \\(a-d\\) and \\(a\\) are the legs.**\n\nThe hypotenuse is \\(a+d\\). By the Pythagorean theorem, we have:\n\\[\n(a-d)^2 + a^2 = (a+d)^2\n\\]\nExpanding both sides, we get:\n\\[\na^2 - 2ad + d^2 + a^2 = a^2 + 2ad + d^2\n\\]\nSimplifying, we find:\n\\[\n2a^2 - 2ad = a^2 + 2ad\n\\]\n\\[\na^2 = 4ad\n\\]\nSince \\(a \\neq 0\\), we can divide both sides by \\(a\\):\n\\[\na = 4d\n\\]\nThe side lengths are \\(3d\\), \\(4d\\), and \\(5d\\). Given that one of the sides is 60, we have three sub-cases:\n1. \\(3d = 60 \\implies d = 20 \\implies a = 80\\). The side lengths are 60, 80, and 100.\n2. \\(4d = 60 \\implies d = 15 \\implies a = 60\\). The side lengths are 45, 60, and 75.\n3. \\(5d = 60 \\implies d = 12 \\implies a = 60\\). The side lengths are 36, 60, and 72.\n\nWe now calculate the area for each set of side lengths:\n1. For side lengths 60, 80, and 100, the area is:\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 60 \\times 80 = 2400\n\\]\n2. For side lengths 45, 60, and 75, the area is:\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 45 \\times 60 = 1350\n\\]\n3. For side lengths 36, 60, and 72, the area is:\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 36 \\times 60 = 1080\n\\]\n\n**Case 2: \\(a\\) and \\(a+d\\) are the legs.**\n\nThe hypotenuse is \\(a-d\\). By the Pythagorean theorem, we have:\n\\[\na^2 + (a+d)^2 = (a-d)^2\n\\]\nExpanding both sides, we get:\n\\[\na^2 + a^2 + 2ad + d^2 = a^2 - 2ad + d^2\n\\]\nSimplifying, we find:\n\\[\n2a^2 + 2ad = a^2 - 2ad\n\\]\n\\[\na^2 + 4ad = 0\n\\]\nSince \\(a \\neq 0\\), we can divide both sides by \\(a\\):\n\\[\na + 4d = 0\n\\]\nThis implies \\(a = -4d\\), which is not possible since side lengths must be positive. Therefore, there are no solutions in this case.\n\nThus, the possible values for the area of the right-angled triangle are \\(\\boxed{1080, 1350, 2400}\\)."

The number of pairs \\((a, b)\\) where neither \\( a \\) nor \\( b \\) is divisible by 2 or 5 is \\( 4 \\times 4 = 16 \\). Therefore, the number of pairs \\((a, b)\\) where at least one of \\( a \\) or \\( b \\) is divisible by 2 or 5 is:\n\\[ 100 - 16 = 84. \\]\nThus, the probability \\( P(10) \\) is:\n\\[ P(10) = \\frac{84}{100} = \\frac{21}{25}. \\]\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{\\frac{21}{25}}. \\]"

If there are no cards on the table, the game continues.\n\n#### Recursive cases:\n- If there is 1 card on the table, the next player has a \\(\\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{1}{3}\\) chance of drawing a card that will lead to a win and a \\(\\frac{4}{6} = \\frac{2}{3}\\) chance of drawing a card that will not lead to a win.\n- If there are 2 cards on the table, the next player has a \\(\\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{1}{3}\\) chance of drawing a card that will lead to a win and a \\(\\frac{4}{6} = \\frac{2}{3}\\) chance of drawing a card that will not lead to a win.\n\n### Step 3: Set up the equations\nLet's denote the probability that Amir wins when there are \\(n\\) cards on the table as \\(P(A_n)\\) and the probability that Brigitte wins when there are \\(n\\) cards on the table as \\(P(B_n)\\).\n\nFor \\(n = 0\\):\n\\[P(A_0) = 0\\]\n\\[P(B_0) = 1\\]\n\nFor \\(n = 1\\):\n\\[P(A_1) = \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot 1 + \\frac{2}{3} \\cdot P(B_1)\\]\n\\[P(B_1) = \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{2}{3} \\cdot P(A_1)\\]\n\nSolving these equations:\n\\[P(A_1) = \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{2}{3} \\cdot P(B_1)\\]\n\\[P(B_1) = \\frac{2}{3} \\cdot P(A_1)\\]\n\\[P(A_1) = \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{2}{3} \\cdot \\frac{2}{3} \\cdot P(A_1)\\]\n\\[P(A_1) = \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{4}{9} \\cdot P(A_1)\\]\n\\[P(A_1) - \\frac{4}{9} \\cdot P(A_1) = \\frac{1}{3}\\]\n\\[\\frac{5}{9} \\cdot P(A_1) = \\frac{1}{3}\\]\n\\[P(A_1) = \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{9}{5} = \\frac{3}{5}\\]\n\\[P(B_1) = \\frac{2}{3} \\cdot \\frac{3}{5} = \\frac{2}{5}\\]\n\nFor \\(n = 2\\):\n\\[P(A_2) = \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot 1 + \\frac{2}{3} \\cdot P(B_2)\\]\n\\[P(B_2) = \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{2}{3} \\cdot P(A_2)\\]\n\nSolving these equations:\n\\[P(A_2) = \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{2}{3} \\cdot P(B_2)\\]\n\\[P(B_2) = \\frac{2}{3} \\cdot P(A_2)\\]\n\\[P(A_2) = \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{2}{3} \\cdot \\frac{2}{3} \\cdot P(A_2)\\]\n\\[P(A_2) = \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{4}{9} \\cdot P(A_2)\\]\n\\[P(A_2) - \\frac{4}{9} \\cdot P(A_2) = \\frac{1}{3}\\]\n\\[\\frac{5}{9} \\cdot P(A_2) = \\frac{1}{3}\\]\n\\[P(A_2) = \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{9}{5} = \\frac{3}{5}\\]\n\\[P(B_2) = \\frac{2}{3} \\cdot \\frac{3}{5} = \\frac{2}{5}\\]\n\nSince the game starts with 0 cards on the table, the probability that Amir wins is:\n\\[\\boxed{\\frac{3}{5}}\\]"

First, we express \\(48 \\sqrt[3]{3}\\) and \\(162 \\sqrt[3]{2}\\) in terms of their prime factorizations:\n\n\\[\n48 = 2^4 \\cdot 3 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\sqrt[3]{3} = 3^{1\/3} \\implies 48 \\sqrt[3]{3} = 2^4 \\cdot 3^{4\/3}\n\\]\n\\[\n162 = 2 \\cdot 3^4 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\sqrt[3]{2} = 2^{1\/3} \\implies 162 \\sqrt[3]{2} = 2^{4\/3} \\cdot 3^4\n\\]\n\nThus, we have:\n\n\\[\n\\ln(48 \\sqrt[3]{3}) = \\ln(2^4 \\cdot 3^{4\/3}) = 4 \\ln 2 + \\frac{4}{3} \\ln 3\n\\]\n\\[\n\\ln(162 \\sqrt[3]{2}) = \\ln(2^{4\/3} \\cdot 3^4) = \\frac{4}{3} \\ln 2 + 4 \\ln 3\n\\]\n\nSubstituting these into our equation, we get:\n\n\\[\n(4 \\ln 2 + \\frac{4}{3} \\ln 3) \\ln(3x) = (\\frac{4}{3} \\ln 2 + 4 \\ln 3) \\ln(2x)\n\\]\n\nWe can factor out the common terms:\n\n\\[\n4 \\ln 2 \\ln(3x) + \\frac{4}{3} \\ln 3 \\ln(3x) = \\frac{4}{3} \\ln 2 \\ln(2x) + 4 \\ln 3 \\ln(2x)\n\\]\n\nDividing through by 4, we get:\n\n\\[\n\\ln 2 \\ln(3x) + \\frac{1}{3} \\ln 3 \\ln(3x) = \\frac{1}{3} \\ln 2 \\ln(2x) + \\ln 3 \\ln(2x)\n\\]\n\nFactoring out the logarithms of \\(x\\), we have:\n\n\\[\n\\ln(3x) (\\ln 2 + \\frac{1}{3} \\ln 3) = \\ln(2x) (\\frac{1}{3} \\ln 2 + \\ln 3)\n\\]\n\nSince \\(\\ln(3x) = \\ln 3 + \\ln x\\) and \\(\\ln(2x) = \\ln 2 + \\ln x\\), we substitute these in:\n\n\\[\n(\\ln 3 + \\ln x) (\\ln 2 + \\frac{1}{3} \\ln 3) = (\\ln 2 + \\ln x) (\\frac{1}{3} \\ln 2 + \\ln 3)\n\\]\n\nExpanding both sides, we get:\n\n\\[\n\\ln 3 \\ln 2 + \\frac{1}{3} \\ln 3 \\ln 3 + \\ln x \\ln 2 + \\frac{1}{3} \\ln x \\ln 3 = \\frac{1}{3} \\ln 2 \\ln 2 + \\ln 2 \\ln x + \\frac{1}{3} \\ln 2 \\ln 3 + \\ln x \\ln 3\n\\]\n\nSimplifying, we have:\n\n\\[\n\\ln 3 \\ln 2 + \\frac{1}{3} \\ln^2 3 + \\ln x \\ln 2 + \\frac{1}{3} \\ln x \\ln 3 = \\frac{1}{3} \\ln^2 2 + \\ln 2 \\ln x + \\frac{1}{3} \\ln 2 \\ln 3 + \\ln x \\ln 3\n\\]\n\nCanceling out the common terms, we get:\n\n\\[\n\\ln 3 \\ln 2 + \\frac{1}{3} \\ln^2 3 = \\frac{1}{3} \\ln^2 2 + \\ln 2 \\ln x\n\\]\n\nRearranging terms, we have:\n\n\\[\n\\ln 3 \\ln 2 + \\frac{1}{3} \\ln^2 3 - \\frac{1}{3} \\ln^2 2 = \\ln 2 \\ln x\n\\]\n\nFactoring out \\(\\ln 2\\) on the left side, we get:\n\n\\[\n\\ln 2 (\\ln 3 + \\frac{1}{3} \\ln 3 - \\frac{1}{3} \\ln 2) = \\ln 2 \\ln x\n\\]\n\nSince \\(\\ln 2 \\neq 0\\), we can divide both sides by \\(\\ln 2\\):\n\n\\[\n\\ln 3 + \\frac{1}{3} \\ln 3 - \\frac{1}{3} \\ln 2 = \\ln x\n\\]\n\nCombining like terms, we get:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{4}{3} \\ln 3 - \\frac{1}{3} \\ln 2 = \\ln x\n\\]\n\nFactoring out \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\), we have:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3} (4 \\ln 3 - \\ln 2) = \\ln x\n\\]\n\nThus, we have:\n\n\\[\nx = e^{\\frac{1}{3} (4 \\ln 3 - \\ln 2)} = e^{\\frac{1}{3} \\ln 81 - \\frac{1}{3} \\ln 2} = e^{\\frac{1}{3} \\ln \\frac{81}{2}} = \\left( \\frac{81}{2}

This means we need to solve the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\log_{10}(x-2) = 1 - \\log_{10}(x+1)\n\\]\n\nFirst, we can combine the logarithmic terms on the right-hand side by using the property of logarithms that states \\( a - \\log_{b}(c) = \\log_{b}(b^a \/ c) \\). Thus, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n\\[\n\\log_{10}(x-2) = \\log_{10}(10) - \\log_{10}(x+1) = \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{10}{x+1}\\right)\n\\]\n\nSince the logarithmic function is one-to-one, we can equate the arguments of the logarithms:\n\n\\[\nx-2 = \\frac{10}{x+1}\n\\]\n\nNext, we solve this equation for \\( x \\).

            "Let's denote the year in which Charlie was born as \\(19xy\\), where \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are digits. This means Charlie was born in the year \\(1900 + 10x + y\\). In the year 2014, Charlie's age is \\(2014 - (1900 + 10x + y) = 114 - 10x - y\\). According to the problem, this age is twice the number formed by the rightmost two digits of the year in which he was born, which is \\(20x + y\\). Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\n\\[114 - 10x - y = 2(20x + y)\\]\n\nSimplifying the right side of the equation, we get:\n\n\\[114 - 10x - y = 40x + 2y\\]\n\nRearranging terms to isolate \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) on one side, we have:\n\n\\[114 = 50x + 3y\\]\n\nWe need to find integer values for \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) such that \\(0 \\leq x \\leq 9\\) and \\(0 \\leq y \\leq 9\\).

The possible values for \\(x\\) are 0, 3, 6, and 9. We will check each case:\n\n1. If \\(x = 0\\):\n   \\[y = \\frac{114 - 50 \\cdot 0}{3} = \\frac{114}{3} = 38\\] (not a valid digit)\n\n2.

            "To determine the number of palindromes in the first 1000 terms of the sequence \\(\\{a_n\\}\\), we need to understand the structure of the sequence and how palindromes form within it.\n\nThe sequence is defined as follows:\n- \\(a_1 = X\\)\n- \\(a_2 = O\\)\n- For \\(n \\geq 3\\), \\(a_n\\) is \\(a_{n-1}\\) followed by the reverse of \\(a_{n-2}\\).\n\nLet's compute the first few terms to identify any patterns:\n- \\(a_1 = X\\)\n- \\(a_2 = O\\)\n- \\(a_3 = a_2 + \\text{reverse}(a_1) = O + O = OX\\)\n- \\(a_4 = a_3 + \\text{reverse}(a_2) = OX + X = OXO\\)\n- \\(a_5 = a_4 + \\text{reverse}(a_3) = OXO + OX = OXOXO\\)\n- \\(a_6 = a_5 + \\text{reverse}(a_4) = OXOXO + OXO = OXOXOOXO\\)\n\nWe observe that the sequence alternates between odd and even lengths. Specifically, \\(a_n\\) has length \\(2^{n-1}\\) for \\(n \\geq 2\\). This is because each term is formed by appending the reverse of the previous term to the previous term, effectively doubling the length of the previous term.\n\nA palindrome is a sequence that reads the same forwards and backwards. Let's analyze the palindromes in the sequence:\n- \\(a_1 = X\\) is not a palindrome.\n- \\(a_2 = O\\) is not a palindrome.\n- \\(a_3 = OX\\) is not a palindrome.\n- \\(a_4 = OXO\\) is a palindrome.\n- \\(a_5 = OXOXO\\) is not a palindrome.\n- \\(a_6 = OXOXOOXO\\) is not a palindrome.\n\nWe see that \\(a_n\\) is a palindrome if and only if \\(n\\) is a power of 2. This is because the structure of the sequence ensures that the only palindromes are those where the length is a power of 2. Specifically, \\(a_{2^k} = OXOX\\ldots OX\\) (with \\(2^k - 1\\) pairs of \\(OX\\)).\n\nTo find the number of palindromes in the first 1000 terms, we need to count the powers of 2 that are less than or equal to 1000. The powers of 2 are \\(2^0, 2^1, 2^2, \\ldots, 2^9\\), which are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, and 512. There are 10 such powers.\n\nTherefore, the number of palindromes in the first 1000 terms of the sequence is \\(\\boxed{10}\\)."

            "To find the smallest positive integer \\( n \\) such that \\( 214 \\cdot n \\) and \\( 2014 \\cdot n \\) have the same number of divisors, we start by determining the prime factorizations of 214 and 2014.\n\nFirst, we factorize 214:\n\\[ 214 = 2 \\times 107. \\]\nSo, the prime factorization of 214 is \\( 2^1 \\times 107^1 \\).\n\nNext, we factorize 2014:\n\\[ 2014 = 2 \\times 1007. \\]\nWe need to factorize 1007. Checking for divisibility by smaller primes, we find:\n\\[ 1007 = 19 \\times 53. \\]\nSo, the prime factorization of 2014 is \\( 2^1 \\times 19^1 \\times 53^1 \\).\n\nLet \\( n = 2^a \\times 19^b \\times 53^c \\times 107^d \\times k \\), where \\( k \\) is coprime with 2, 19, 53, and 107.

Therefore, the number of divisors of \\( 214 \\cdot n \\) is:\n\\[ (1+a+1)(1+b+1)(1+c+1)(1+d+1) \\cdot \\text{(number of divisors of } k\\text{)}. \\]\nAnd the number of divisors of \\( 2014 \\cdot n \\) is:\n\\[ (1+a+1)(1+b+1)(1+c+1)(1+d+1) \\cdot \\text{(number of divisors of } k\\text{)}. \\]\n\nFor \\( 214 \\cdot n \\) and \\( 2014 \\cdot n \\) to have the same number of divisors, the number of divisors of \\( k \\) must be the same for both expressions. Since \\( k \\) is coprime with 2, 19, 53, and 107, the smallest \\( k \\) is 1. Therefore, we need:\n\\[ (2+a)(2+b)(2+c)(2+d) = (2+a)(2+b)(2+c)(2+d). \\]\nThis equation is always true, so we need to find the smallest \\( n \\) such that the exponents of the primes in the factorizations of \\( 214 \\cdot n \\) and \\( 2014 \\cdot n \\) are the same. This means we need to make the exponents of 19 and 53 in the factorization of \\( 214 \\cdot n \\) equal to the exponents of 19 and 53 in the factorization of \\( 2014 \\cdot n \\).\n\nSince the exponent of 19 in \\( 214 \\cdot n \\) is \\( b \\) and the exponent of 19 in \\( 2014 \\cdot n \\) is 1, we need \\( b = 1 \\). Similarly, since the exponent of 53 in \\( 214 \\cdot n \\) is \\( c \\) and the exponent of 53 in \\( 2014 \\cdot n \\) is 1, we need \\( c = 1 \\).\n\nTherefore, the smallest \\( n \\) is:\n\\[ n = 19^1 \\times 53^1 = 19 \\times 53 = 1007. \\]\n\nThus, the smallest positive integer \\( n \\) such that \\( 214 \\cdot n \\) and \\( 2014 \\cdot n \\) have the same number of divisors is:\n\\[ \\boxed{1007}. \\]"

Formally, a group assignment on $T$ is a function $f: T \\rightarrow\\{1,2, \\ldots, k\\}$, satisfying the condition that if $f\\left(r_{i}\\right)=f\\left(r_{j}\\right)$ for $i \\neq j$, then $r_{i}$ and $r_{j}$ do not know any of the same recipes. The group number of a town $T$, denoted $\\operatorname{gr}(T)$, is the least positive integer $k$ for which there exists a group assignment on $T$.\n\nFor example, consider once again the town of ARMLton. A valid group assignment would be $f($ Paul $)=f($ Kelly $)=1$ and $f($ Arnold $)=2$. The function which gives the value 1 to each resident of ARMLton is not a group assignment, because Paul and Arnold must be assigned to different groups.\n\n\nFor a dish $D$, a resident is called a $D$-chef if he or she knows how to make the dish $D$. Define $\\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)$ to be the set of residents in $T$ who are $D$-chefs. For example, in ARMLville, David is a steak-chef and a pancakes-chef. Further, $\\operatorname{chef}_{\\text {ARMLville }}($ steak $)=\\{$ Sally, David $\\}$.\n\n\nIf $\\operatorname{gr}(T)=\\left|\\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)\\right|$ for some $D \\in \\operatorname{dish}(T)$, then $T$ is called homogeneous. If $\\operatorname{gr}(T)>\\left|\\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)\\right|$ for each dish $D \\in \\operatorname{dish}(T)$, then $T$ is called heterogeneous. For example, ARMLton is homogeneous, because $\\operatorname{gr}($ ARMLton $)=2$ and exactly two chefs make pie, but ARMLville is heterogeneous, because even though each dish is only cooked by two chefs, $\\operatorname{gr}($ ARMLville $)=3$.\n\n\nA resident cycle is a sequence of distinct residents $r_{1}, \\ldots, r_{n}$ such that for each $1 \\leq i \\leq n-1$, the residents $r_{i}$ and $r_{i+1}$ know how to make a common dish, residents $r_{n}$ and $r_{1}$ know how to make a common dish, and no other pair of residents $r_{i}$ and $r_{j}, 1 \\leq i, j \\leq n$ know how to make a common dish. Two resident cycles are indistinguishable if they contain the same residents (in any order), and distinguishable otherwise. For example, if $r_{1}, r_{2}, r_{3}, r_{4}$ is a resident cycle, then $r_{2}, r_{1}, r_{4}, r_{3}$ and $r_{3}, r_{2}, r_{1}, r_{4}$ are indistinguishable resident cycles.\nIn terms of $k$ and $d$, find the number of distinguishable resident cycles of length $k$ in $\\mathcal{F}_{d}$.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

Therefore, the repeating part without the inserted digits is \\( 0231846597 \\), which is a 10-digit number.\n\nThe length of the repeating part of the decimal expansion of \\( \\frac{1}{N} \\) is the smallest positive integer \\( k \\) such that \\( 10^k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{N} \\). In this case, the length of the repeating part is 10, so we need to find \\( N \\) such that the order of 10 modulo \\( N \\) is 10.

Therefore, 11 is not the value of \\( N \\).\n\nNext, we check the factor 73. We need to check if the order of 10 modulo 73 is 10. We do this by checking the powers of 10 modulo 73:\n\n\\[\n10^2 \\equiv 100 \\equiv 27 \\pmod{73}\n\\]\n\\[\n10^4 \\equiv 27^2 = 729 \\equiv 32 \\pmod{73}\n\\]\n\\[\n10^5 \\equiv 10 \\cdot 32 = 320 \\equiv 47 \\pmod{73}\n\\]\n\\[\n10^6 \\equiv 10 \\cdot 47 = 470 \\equiv 18 \\pmod{73}\n\\]\n\\[\n10^7 \\equiv 10 \\cdot 18 = 180 \\equiv 31 \\pmod{73}\n\\]\n\\[\n10^8 \\equiv 10 \\cdot 31 = 310 \\equiv 64 \\pmod{73}\n\\]\n\\[\n10^9 \\equiv 10 \\cdot 64 = 640 \\equiv 52 \\pmod{73}\n\\]\n\\[\n10^{10} \\equiv 10 \\cdot 52 = 520 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{73}\n\\]\n\nSince \\( 10^{10} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{73} \\) and no smaller power of 10 is congruent to 1 modulo 73, the order of 10 modulo 73 is 10.

            "To determine the digit \\( Y \\) such that the seven-digit number \\( 123X5Y7 \\) is not a multiple of 11 for any digit \\( X \\), we need to use the divisibility rule for 11.

Therefore, the difference we need to consider is:\n\\[\n(1 + 3 + 5 + 7) - (2 + X + Y) = 16 - (2 + X + Y) = 14 - X - Y\n\\]\nFor the number \\( 123X5Y7 \\) to be a multiple of 11, \\( 14 - X - Y \\) must be a multiple of 11.

The square \\(A R M L\\) is a unit square with side length 1, and the point \\(\\left(\\frac{2}{7}, \\frac{3}{7}\\right)\\) lies inside the square.\n\nThe shortest path that touches three sides of the square can be found by reflecting the square across its sides and finding the straight-line path in the reflected plane. We will reflect the square across the sides in such a way that the path from \\(\\left(\\frac{2}{7}, \\frac{3}{7}\\right)\\) to itself, touching three sides, can be represented as a straight line in the reflected plane.\n\nFirst, let's reflect the square across the bottom side (the x-axis).

Therefore, the number of ways to position a $k \\times k$ square such that the center unit square is not included is $(8-k)^2 - (7-k)^2 = (8-k)^2 - (7-k)^2 = (8-k+7-k)(8-k-7+k) = (15-2k)(1) = 15-2k$.\n\nNow, we sum this for all possible values of $k$ from 1 to 7:\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=1}^{7} (15-2k) = (15-2 \\cdot 1) + (15-2 \\cdot 2) + (15-2 \\cdot 3) + (15-2 \\cdot 4) + (15-2 \\cdot 5) + (15-2 \\cdot 6) + (15-2 \\cdot 7) = 13 + 11 + 9 + 7 + 5 + 3 + 1 = 49.\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of different ways to cut a single portion from an ARMLbar is \\(\\boxed{125}\\)."

Each trapezoid has a height of 12 (half the side length of the hexagon) and bases of 24 and 12. The area of one trapezoid is:\n\\[\n\\text{Area of one trapezoid} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times (24 + 12) \\times 12 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 36 \\times 12 = 216\n\\]\nSince there are two such trapezoids, their total area is:\n\\[\n2 \\times 216 = 432\n\\]\nThe area of the rectangle in the middle is:\n\\[\n\\text{Area of the rectangle} = 12 \\times 24 = 288\n\\]\nThus, the total area of quadrilateral \\( GBCDKL \\) is:\n\\[\n432 + 288 = 720\n\\]\nHowever, we know that the area of \\( GBCDKL \\) is \\( 432\\sqrt{3} \\), so we need to adjust our understanding of the configuration.

We will analyze the binary representations of numbers from 1 to 256 and count the pairs of consecutive 1's.\n\nFirst, let's consider the binary representations of numbers from 1 to 255 (since 256 is \\( 100000000_2 \\) and has no pairs of consecutive 1's). We can break this down by the number of bits in the binary representation.\n\nFor a number \\( n \\) with \\( k \\) bits, the number of pairs of consecutive 1's can be counted by examining each possible pair of consecutive bits. Specifically, we need to count the number of times \"11\" appears in the binary representation of \\( n \\).\n\nWe can use a combinatorial approach to count the number of pairs of consecutive 1's. For each number of bits \\( k \\), we can count the number of valid binary strings of length \\( k \\) that contain at least one pair of consecutive 1's.\n\nLet's start with the smallest number of bits and work our way up:\n\n- For 1-bit numbers (1 to 1), there are no pairs of consecutive 1's, so \\( C(n) = 0 \\).\n- For 2-bit numbers (1 to 3), the numbers are 1, 10, 11, 100, 101, 110, 111.

            "To find the largest possible value for the median of a set \\( S \\) containing thirteen distinct positive integers whose sum is 120, we need to maximize the median value while ensuring the sum constraint is satisfied.\n\nFirst, recall that the median of a set with an odd number of elements is the middle element when the set is ordered. For a set of 13 elements, the median is the 7th element when the elements are arranged in increasing order.\n\nLet's denote the elements of the set \\( S \\) in increasing order as \\( a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_{13} \\). The median of this set is \\( a_7 \\). To maximize \\( a_7 \\), we need to minimize the sum of the first six elements and the sum of the last six elements while ensuring all elements are distinct positive integers and their total sum is 120.\n\nThe smallest possible values for \\( a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_6 \\) are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Their sum is:\n\\[ 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21. \\]\n\nLet \\( a_7 = x \\).

            "To determine the least positive integer \\( b \\) such that the number \\( T! \\) (where \\( T = 11 \\)) ends in exactly two zeroes when expressed in base \\( b \\), we need to understand the conditions under which a number ends in a zero in a given base.

            "To solve the problem, we need to understand the distance function \\(d(n)\\) and how it affects the movement of the family. The distance function \\(d(n)\\) is defined such that if \\(n = 3^k n'\\) where \\(k \\geq 0\\) and \\(n'\\) is not divisible by 3, then \\(d(n) = 3^{-k}\\). This means that the distance from a house \\(n\\) to City Hall is determined by the highest power of 3 that divides \\(n\\).\n\nGiven that the family starts at house 34, we need to find the maximum possible distance from his original house after visiting a series of houses such that the distance between consecutive houses is \\(1\/3\\). This means that each move changes the house number by a multiple of 3.\n\nFirst, let's determine the distance of house 34 from City Hall. The prime factorization of 34 is \\(34 = 2 \\times 17\\), which is not divisible by 3. Therefore, the highest power of 3 that divides 34 is \\(3^0\\), so \\(d(34) = 3^0 = 1\\).\n\nThe family can move to a house that is 1\/3 away from 34. This means the new house number \\(n_1\\) can be written as \\(n_1 = 34 + 3^k m\\) where \\(k \\geq 0\\) and \\(m\\) is an integer not divisible by 3. The distance \\(d(n_1)\\) will be \\(3^{-k}\\).\n\nTo maximize the distance from the original house, the family should make as many moves as possible, each time changing the house number by a multiple of 3. The maximum distance from the original house will be achieved if the family moves to a house that is as far as possible from 34 while still maintaining the distance of \\(1\/3\\) between consecutive houses.\n\nThe maximum distance from the original house can be calculated by considering the maximum number of moves the family can make. Since each move changes the house number by a multiple of 3, the maximum distance will be the sum of the distances of each move. The maximum distance is achieved by moving to the farthest house possible while still maintaining the distance of \\(1\/3\\) between consecutive houses.\n\nThe maximum distance from the original house is the sum of the distances of each move, which is \\(1 + 1\/3 + 1\/9 + 1\/27 + \\cdots\\). This is a geometric series with the first term 1 and the common ratio \\(1\/3\\). The sum of this infinite series is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^k = \\frac{1}{1 - \\frac{1}{3}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{2}{3}} = \\frac{3}{2}\n\\]\n\nHowever, since the family can only move a finite number of times, the maximum possible distance from the original house is the sum of the distances of the moves, which is the sum of the series up to the point where the family can no longer move to a new house. The maximum possible distance is the sum of the distances of the moves, which is the sum of the series up to the point where the family can no longer move to a new house.\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible distance from the original house is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{6}\n\\]"

            "To solve the problem, we need to determine the prices of apples and peaches in cents. Let's denote the price of an apple by \\(a\\) cents and the price of a peach by \\(p\\) cents. We will use the information given about Emma and Jonah to set up equations and solve for \\(a\\) and \\(p\\).\n\nFirst, let's analyze Emma's purchase. Emma buys 5 apples and 5 peaches, so the total cost is \\(5a + 5p\\) cents. Emma pays with a $5 bill, which is 500 cents, but she gets change because she doesn't have enough money. This means that the total cost is more than 500 cents but less than 1000 cents (since she gets another $5 bill as change). Therefore, we have:\n\\[500 < 5a + 5p < 1000\\]\nDividing the entire inequality by 5, we get:\n\\[100 < a + p < 200\\]\n\nNext, let's analyze Jonah's purchase. Jonah buys 2 apples and 12 peaches, so the total cost is \\(2a + 12p\\) cents. Jonah pays with a $10 bill, which is 1000 cents, but he gets change because he doesn't have enough money. This means that the total cost is more than 1000 cents but less than 2000 cents (since he gets another $10 bill as change). Therefore, we have:\n\\[1000 < 2a + 12p < 2000\\]\nDividing the entire inequality by 2, we get:\n\\[500 < a + 6p < 1000\\]\n\nNow we have two inequalities:\n1. \\(100 < a + p < 200\\)\n2. \\(500 < a + 6p < 1000\\)\n\nWe need to find integer values of \\(a\\) and \\(p\\) that satisfy both inequalities. Let's start by isolating \\(a\\) in the first inequality:\n\\[100 < a + p < 200\\]\nThis can be rewritten as:\n\\[100 - p < a < 200 - p\\]\n\nNow let's substitute this into the second inequality:\n\\[500 < a + 6p < 1000\\]\nSubstituting the range for \\(a\\), we get:\n\\[500 < (100 - p) + 6p < 1000\\]\n\\[500 < 100 + 5p < 1000\\]\nSubtracting 100 from all parts of the inequality, we get:\n\\[400 < 5p < 900\\]\nDividing by 5, we get:\n\\[80 < p < 180\\]\n\nSince \\(p\\) is an integer, the possible values for \\(p\\) are between 81 and 179. We need to find the smallest possible value of \\(p\\) that satisfies both inequalities. Let's start with the smallest possible value of \\(p\\), which is 81.\n\nIf \\(p = 81\\), then:\n\\[100 < a + 81 < 200\\]\n\\[19 < a < 119\\]\n\nNow we substitute \\(p = 81\\) into the second inequality:\n\\[500 < a + 6 \\cdot 81 < 1000\\]\n\\[500 < a + 486 < 1000\\]\n\\[14 < a < 514\\]\n\nSince \\(a\\) must be an integer, the possible values for \\(a\\) are between 19 and 118. The smallest possible value for \\(a\\) is 19. Therefore, the smallest possible values for \\(a\\) and \\(p\\) are \\(a = 19\\) and \\(p = 81\\).\n\nNow, let's calculate the cost of 25 peaches:\n\\[25p = 25 \\cdot 81 = 2025 \\text{ cents}\\]\n\nTherefore, the least amount of money Helen can expect to pay is:\n\\[\\boxed{2025}\\]"

Since \\( f \\) maps \\( S \\) to \\( S \\), each \\( s_n \\) is a sum of elements from \\( S \\), and thus each \\( s_n \\) is an integer between \\( 20 \\) and \\( 400 \\) (the minimum value is \\( 20 \\times 1 = 20 \\) and the maximum value is \\( 20 \\times 20 = 400 \\)).\n\nThe key insight is that the sequence \\( s_n \\) is completely determined by the values of \\( f \\) on the set \\( S \\). Since there are only \\( 20 \\) elements in \\( S \\), the function \\( f \\) can be represented as a permutation of \\( S \\) (or a combination of disjoint cycles). The period of the sequence \\( s_n \\) is determined by the length of the longest cycle in the permutation of \\( f \\).\n\nThe longest possible cycle in a permutation of \\( 20 \\) elements is \\( 20 \\). This means that the sequence \\( s_n \\) will repeat every \\( 20 \\) steps, because the function \\( f \\) applied \\( 20 \\) times to any element in the longest cycle will return that element to its original position. Therefore, the sequence \\( s_n \\) will be periodic with a period of at most \\( 20 \\).\n\nTo confirm, consider the sequence \\( s_n \\) for \\( n = 1, 2, \\ldots, 20 \\). The value of \\( s_{20} \\) is the sum of the values of \\( f \\) applied \\( 20 \\) times to each element of \\( S \\).

            "To solve the problem, we need to determine the area of the circle \\(\\omega\\) in which the hexagon \\(H E X A G O\\) is inscribed. We are given that each angle of the hexagon is \\(120^\\circ\\) and the side lengths are \\(HE = XA = G O = p\\) and \\(EX = AG = OH = q\\).\n\nFirst, let's analyze the structure of the hexagon. Since each internal angle is \\(120^\\circ\\), we can infer that the hexagon can be divided into six equilateral triangles by drawing lines from the center of the circle to each vertex of the hexagon. This is because the central angle subtended by each side of the hexagon is \\(60^\\circ\\) (since \\(360^\\circ \/ 6 = 60^\\circ\\)).\n\nGiven that \\(HE = XA = G O = p\\) and \\(EX = AG = OH = q\\), we can see that the hexagon is symmetric and can be divided into two sets of three equilateral triangles with side lengths \\(p\\) and \\(q\\), respectively.\n\nThe radius \\(R\\) of the circle is the same for all vertices of the hexagon. The side length of an equilateral triangle inscribed in a circle is equal to the radius of the circle times \\(\\sqrt{3}\\). Therefore, we have:\n\\[ p = R \\sqrt{3} \\]\n\\[ q = R \\sqrt{3} \\]\n\nSince \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) are distinct elements of the set \\(S\\) and \\(p < q\\), we can conclude that \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) are the two least distinct elements of \\(S\\). However, since \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) are both equal to \\(R \\sqrt{3}\\), this implies that \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) must be the same, which contradicts the condition that they are distinct. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate the problem with the correct interpretation that \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) are the distinct elements of the set \\(S\\) and not necessarily the side lengths of the equilateral triangles.\n\nGiven that the hexagon is symmetric and can be divided into two sets of three equilateral triangles, we can use the fact that the area of a circle is given by \\(\\pi R^2\\). To find \\(R\\), we need to use the relationship between the side lengths and the radius of the circle. Since the hexagon is symmetric and each side length is either \\(p\\) or \\(q\\), we can use the fact that the radius \\(R\\) is the same for all vertices of the hexagon.\n\nThe area of the circle is:\n\\[ \\pi R^2 \\]\n\nSince \\(p = R \\sqrt{3}\\) and \\(q = R \\sqrt{3}\\), we can conclude that the radius \\(R\\) is the same for both \\(p\\) and \\(q\\). Therefore, the area of the circle is:\n\\[ \\pi R^2 = \\pi \\left(\\frac{p}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)^2 = \\pi \\left(\\frac{q}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)^2 = \\pi \\frac{p^2}{3} = \\pi \\frac{q^2}{3} \\]\n\nSince \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) are distinct, we can use either \\(p\\) or \\(q\\) to find the area of the circle. Therefore, the area of the circle is:\n\\[ \\pi \\frac{p^2}{3} \\]\n\nSince \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) are the two least distinct elements of \\(S\\) and \\(p < q\\), we can conclude that the area of the circle is:\n\\[ \\boxed{3\\pi} \\]"

Now, let's check 3 and 5:\n- 3 is not relatively prime to 6.\n- 5 is not relatively prime to 10 (if we extend the sequence).\n\nThus, the only crom mileage odd number in this sequence is 1.

The discriminant \\(\\Delta\\) of the quadratic polynomial \\(x^2 + (u+v)x + (uv + 4)\\) is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta = (u+v)^2 - 4(uv + 4) = u^2 + 2uv + v^2 - 4uv - 16 = u^2 - 2uv + v^2 - 16 = (u-v)^2 - 16\n\\]\n\nWe need \\((u-v)^2 - 16\\) to be a perfect square. Let \\(k\\) be an integer such that:\n\n\\[\n(u-v)^2 - 16 = k^2\n\\]\n\nThis can be rewritten as:\n\n\\[\n(u-v)^2 - k^2 = 16\n\\]\n\nThis is a difference of squares, which factors as:\n\n\\[\n((u-v) - k)((u-v) + k) = 16\n\\]\n\nWe need to find all pairs of integers \\((a, b)\\) such that \\(ab = 16\\).

            "To determine the least possible degree measure of the smallest interior angle in the convex hexagon TIEBRK, we start by noting that the sum of the interior angles of a hexagon is given by the formula \\((n-2) \\times 180^\\circ\\), where \\(n\\) is the number of sides. For a hexagon, \\(n = 6\\), so the sum of the interior angles is:\n\n\\[\n(6-2) \\times 180^\\circ = 4 \\times 180^\\circ = 720^\\circ\n\\]\n\nSince the interior angles are in arithmetic progression, we can denote the angles as \\(a, a+d, a+2d, a+3d, a+4d, a+5d\\), where \\(a\\) is the smallest angle and \\(d\\) is the common difference. The sum of these angles is:\n\n\\[\na + (a+d) + (a+2d) + (a+3d) + (a+4d) + (a+5d) = 6a + 15d\n\\]\n\nWe know this sum must equal 720 degrees, so we have:\n\n\\[\n6a + 15d = 720\n\\]\n\nWe can simplify this equation by dividing every term by 3:\n\n\\[\n2a + 5d = 240\n\\]\n\nWe need to find the smallest possible value of \\(a\\) such that both \\(a\\) and \\(d\\) are positive integers.

            "To solve for the diameter of the circumcircle of \\(\\triangle ABD\\), we start by noting that the circumcircle of \\(\\triangle ABD\\) intersects \\(\\overline{CD}\\) at point \\(E\\), distinct from \\(D\\). This means that \\(A, B, D, E\\) are concyclic. We are given that \\(BC = 4\\), \\(CE = 5\\), and \\(DE = 7\\). We need to find the diameter of the circumcircle of \\(\\triangle ABD\\).\n\nFirst, we use the fact that \\(A, B, D, E\\) are concyclic. By the Power of a Point theorem at point \\(C\\) with respect to the circumcircle of \\(\\triangle ABD\\), we have:\n\\[\nCB \\cdot CE = CD \\cdot CE - DE^2 = CD \\cdot 5 - 7^2 = CD \\cdot 5 - 49.\n\\]\nSince \\(CD = CB + BD = 4 + BD\\), we substitute \\(CD\\) in the equation:\n\\[\n4 \\cdot 5 = (4 + BD) \\cdot 5 - 49.\n\\]\nSimplifying, we get:\n\\[\n20 = 20 + 5BD - 49 \\implies 5BD = 49 \\implies BD = \\frac{49}{5}.\n\\]\n\nNext, we use the fact that the sum of the opposite angles in a cyclic quadrilateral is \\(180^\\circ\\). Therefore, \\(\\angle B + \\angle D = 270^\\circ\\) implies \\(\\angle A + \\angle C = 90^\\circ\\). This means that \\(\\angle ABD + \\angle ADB = 90^\\circ\\), so \\(\\angle ABD\\) and \\(\\angle ADB\\) are complementary angles. This implies that \\(\\triangle ABD\\) is a right triangle with \\(\\angle ABD = 90^\\circ\\).\n\nIn a right triangle, the hypotenuse is the diameter of the circumcircle. Therefore, the diameter of the circumcircle of \\(\\triangle ABD\\) is \\(AB\\). We can find \\(AB\\) using the Pythagorean theorem in \\(\\triangle ABD\\):\n\\[\nAB^2 = AD^2 + BD^2.\n\\]\nWe need to find \\(AD\\). Since \\(E\\) is on the circumcircle of \\(\\triangle ABD\\), \\(\\angle AED = \\angle ABD = 90^\\circ\\). Therefore, \\(\\triangle AED\\) is a right triangle with \\(\\angle AED = 90^\\circ\\). Using the Pythagorean theorem in \\(\\triangle AED\\), we have:\n\\[\nAD^2 = AE^2 + DE^2.\n\\]\nWe need to find \\(AE\\). Since \\(E\\) is on the circumcircle of \\(\\triangle ABD\\), \\(\\angle AEB = \\angle ADB\\). Therefore, \\(\\triangle AEB\\) is similar to \\(\\triangle ABD\\) by AA similarity. This gives us the ratio:\n\\[\n\\frac{AE}{AB} = \\frac{AD}{BD}.\n\\]\nWe can find \\(AD\\) using the fact that \\(AD^2 = AE^2 + DE^2\\). However, we can also use the fact that \\(AB\\) is the hypotenuse of \\(\\triangle ABD\\). Therefore, we have:\n\\[\nAB^2 = AD^2 + BD^2 = (AE^2 + DE^2) + BD^2 = (AE^2 + 7^2) + \\left(\\frac{49}{5}\\right)^2 = (AE^2 + 49) + \\frac{2401}{25} = AE^2 + 49 + 96.04 = AE^2 + 145.04.\n\\]\nSince \\(AB\\) is the hypotenuse, we have:\n\\[\nAB = \\sqrt{145.04} = \\sqrt{\\frac{7252}{25}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{7252}}{5} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{1813}}{5}.\n\\]\nHowever, we can simplify this to:\n\\[\nAB = \\sqrt{145} = \\sqrt{145}.\n\\]\nTherefore, the diameter of the circumcircle of \\(\\triangle ABD\\) is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{13}.\n\\]"

            "To solve the problem, we need to analyze the geometric properties of the parallelogram and the rotation. Let's denote the side lengths of the parallelogram \\(ABCD\\) as \\(AB = CD = a\\) and \\(AD = BC = b\\). The rotation of the parallelogram about point \\(A\\) results in a new parallelogram \\(AB'C'D'\\) such that \\(D\\) lies on \\(\\overline{AB'}\\).\n\nGiven that \\(\\left[B'C D\\right] = \\left[A B D'\\right] = \\left[B C C'\\right]\\), we need to find \\(\\tan \\angle ABD\\).\n\nFirst, let's consider the area relationships. Since \\(D\\) lies on \\(\\overline{AB'}\\), the point \\(D\\) is the image of \\(D\\) under the rotation. This means that the rotation angle \\(\\theta\\) is such that the area of \\(\\triangle B'CD\\) is equal to the area of \\(\\triangle ABD'\\) and the area of \\(\\triangle BCC'\\).\n\nThe area of \\(\\triangle B'CD\\) is half the area of the parallelogram \\(ABCD\\) because \\(D\\) lies on \\(\\overline{AB'}\\). Similarly, the area of \\(\\triangle ABD'\\) is also half the area of the parallelogram \\(ABCD\\). Therefore, the area of \\(\\triangle BCC'\\) must also be half the area of the parallelogram \\(ABCD\\).\n\nSince the rotation is about point \\(A\\), the angle \\(\\theta\\) is the angle of rotation. The rotation of the parallelogram results in the areas of the triangles being equal, which implies that the angle \\(\\theta\\) must be such that the rotation aligns the points in a specific way. The only angle that satisfies this condition is \\(\\theta = 60^\\circ\\) or \\(\\theta = 120^\\circ\\). However, since the problem does not specify which angle, we can use the fact that the tangent of the angle is the same for both cases.\n\nFor \\(\\theta = 60^\\circ\\), we have:\n\\[\n\\tan 60^\\circ = \\sqrt{3}\n\\]\n\nThus, the value of \\(\\tan \\angle ABD\\) is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\sqrt{3}}\n\\]"

The units digits of the powers of 7 repeat in a cycle of 4: \\(7, 9, 3, 1\\). To determine the units digit of \\(7^{2023}\\), we need to find the remainder when 2023 is divided by 4.

Let \\(BD = d\\). Then \\(c - d = 7\\), so \\(d = c - 7\\).\n\nWe can use Stewart's Theorem to find a relationship between the sides of the triangle and the length of the angle bisector. Stewart's Theorem states that for a triangle with sides \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and a cevian \\(d\\) that divides side \\(a\\) into segments \\(m\\) and \\(n\\), the following equation holds:\n\n\\[\nb^2m + c^2n = a(d^2 + mn)\n\\]\n\nIn our case, \\(a = b\\), \\(b = c\\), \\(c = c\\), \\(m = \\frac{b}{2}\\), \\(n = \\frac{b}{2}\\), and \\(d = c - 7\\). Substituting these values into Stewart's Theorem, we get:\n\n\\[\nc^2 \\left(\\frac{b}{2}\\right) + c^2 \\left(\\frac{b}{2}\\right) = b \\left((c-7)^2 + \\left(\\frac{b}{2}\\right) \\left(\\frac{b}{2}\\right)\\right)\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the left side, we have:\n\n\\[\nc^2 \\left(\\frac{b}{2} + \\frac{b}{2}\\right) = c^2 b\n\\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\nc^2 b = b \\left((c-7)^2 + \\frac{b^2}{4}\\right)\n\\]\n\nDividing both sides by \\(b\\) (assuming \\(b \\neq 0\\)), we get:\n\n\\[\nc^2 = (c-7)^2 + \\frac{b^2}{4}\n\\]\n\nExpanding the right side, we have:\n\n\\[\nc^2 = c^2 - 14c + 49 + \\frac{b^2}{4}\n\\]\n\nSubtracting \\(c^2\\) from both sides, we get:\n\n\\[\n0 = -14c + 49 + \\frac{b^2}{4}\n\\]\n\nRearranging terms, we have:\n\n\\[\n14c - 49 = \\frac{b^2}{4}\n\\]\n\nMultiplying both sides by 4, we get:\n\n\\[\n56c - 196 = b^2\n\\]\n\nSince \\(b\\) is an integer, \\(56c - 196\\) must be a perfect square. We also know that \\(c = d + 7\\). Let's test some values of \\(c\\) to find an integer solution for \\(b\\).\n\nIf \\(c = 13\\), then:\n\n\\[\n56 \\cdot 13 - 196 = 728 - 196 = 532\n\\]\n\n532 is not a perfect square.\n\nIf \\(c = 14\\), then:\n\n\\[\n56 \\cdot 14 - 196 = 784 - 196 = 588\n\\]\n\n588 is not a perfect square.\n\nIf \\(c = 15\\), then:\n\n\\[\n56 \\cdot 15 - 196 = 840 - 196 = 644\n\\]\n\n644 is not a perfect square.\n\nIf \\(c = 16\\), then:\n\n\\[\n56 \\cdot 16 - 196 = 896 - 196 = 700\n\\]\n\n700 is not a perfect square.\n\nIf \\(c = 17\\), then:\n\n\\[\n56 \\cdot 17 - 196 = 952 - 196 = 756\n\\]\n\n756 is not a perfect square.\n\nIf \\(c = 18\\), then:\n\n\\[\n56 \\cdot 18 - 196 = 1008 - 196 = 812\n\\]\n\n812 is not a perfect square.\n\nIf \\(c = 19\\), then:\n\n\\[\n56 \\cdot 19 - 196 = 1064 - 196 = 868\n\\]\n\n868 is not a perfect square.\n\nIf \\(c = 20\\), then:\n\n\\[\n56 \\cdot 20 - 196 = 1120 - 196 = 924\n\\]\n\n924 is not a perfect square.\n\nIf \\(c = 21\\), then:\n\n\\[\n56 \\cdot 21 - 196 = 1176 - 196 = 980\n\\]\n\n980 is not a perfect square.\n\nIf \\(c = 22\\), then:\n\n\\[\n56 \\cdot 22 - 196 = 1232 - 196 = 1036\n\\]\n\n1036 is not a perfect square.\n\nIf \\(c = 23\\), then:\n\n\\[\n56 \\cdot 23 - 196 = 1288 - 196 = 1092\n\\]\n\n1092 is not a perfect square.\n\nIf \\(c = 24\\), then:\n\n\\[\n56 \\cdot 24 - 196 = 1344 - 196 = 1148\n\\]\n\n1148 is not a perfect square.\n\nIf \\(c = 25\\), then:\n\n\\[\n56 \\cdot 25 - 196 = 1400 - 196 = 1204\n\\]\n\n1204 is not a perfect square.\n\nIf \\(c = 26\\), then:\n\n\\[\n56 \\cdot 26 - 196 = 1456 - 196 = 1260\n\\]\n\n1260 is not a perfect square.\n\nIf \\(c = 27\\), then:\n\n\\[\n56 \\cdot 27 - 196 = 1512 - 196 = 1316\n\\]\n\n1316 is not a perfect square.\n\nIf \\(c = 28\\), then:\n\n\\[\n56 \\cdot 28 - 196 = 1568 - 196 = 1372\n\\]\n\n1372 is not a perfect square.\n\nIf \\(c = 29\\), then:\n\n\\[\n56 \\cdot 29 - 196 = 1624 - 196 = 1428\n\\]\n\n1428 is not a perfect square.\n\nIf \\(c = 30\\), then:\n\n\\[\n56 \\cdot 30 - 196 = 1680 - 196 = 1484\n\\]\n\n1484 is not a perfect square.\n\nIf \\(c = 31\\), then:\n\n\\[\n56 \\cdot 31 - 196 = 1736 - 196 = 1540\n\\]\n\n1540 is not a perfect square.\n\nIf \\(c = 32\\), then:\n\n\\[\n56 \\cdot 32 - 196 = 1792 - 196 = 1596\n\\]\n\n1596 is not a perfect square.\n\nIf \\(c = 33\\), then:\n\n\\[\n56 \\cdot 33 - 196 = 1848 - 196 = 1652\n\\]\n\n1652 is not a perfect square.\n\nIf \\(c = 34\\), then:\n\n\\[\n56 \\cdot 34 - 196 = 1904 - 196 = 1708\n\\]\n\n1708 is not a perfect square.\n\nIf \\(c = 35\\), then:\n\n\\[\n56 \\cdot 35 - 196 = 1960 - 196 = 1764\n\\]\n\n1764 is a perfect square, and \\(1764 = 42^2\\).

            "To find the average value of \\(A + BC + CDE + DEF + EFG + FGH\\) over all permutations \\((A, B, C, D, E, F)\\) of the zeros of the polynomial \\(f(x) = x^6 + 2x^5 + 3x^4 + 5x^3 + 8x^2 + 13x + 21\\), we start by noting that the zeros of the polynomial are distinct complex numbers. Let's denote these zeros by \\(a, b, c, d, e, f\\).\n\nThe expression we need to average is \\(A + BC + CDE + DEF + EFG + FGH\\). Since the zeros are distinct, any permutation of these zeros will be equally likely. There are \\(6!\\) (720) permutations of the six zeros.\n\nFirst, we calculate the average value of \\(A\\). Since \\(A\\) is just one of the six zeros, and the zeros are distinct, the average value of \\(A\\) over all permutations is simply the average of all the zeros. By Vieta's formulas, the sum of the zeros of the polynomial \\(f(x)\\) is given by the coefficient of \\(x^5\\) (with a sign change) divided by the leading coefficient. For the polynomial \\(f(x) = x^6 + 2x^5 + 3x^4 + 5x^3 + 8x^2 + 13x + 21\\), the sum of the zeros is \\(-2\\). Therefore, the average value of \\(A\\) is \\(-\\frac{2}{6} = -\\frac{1}{3}\\).\n\nNext, we calculate the average value of \\(BC\\). Since \\(B\\) and \\(C\\) are two of the six zeros, the average value of \\(BC\\) is the sum of the products of all pairs of the zeros divided by the number of pairs. The sum of the products of all pairs of the zeros is given by the coefficient of \\(x^4\\) (with a sign change) divided by the leading coefficient. For the polynomial \\(f(x)\\), the sum of the products of all pairs of the zeros is 3. Therefore, the average value of \\(BC\\) is \\(\\frac{3}{\\binom{6}{2}} = \\frac{3}{15} = \\frac{1}{5}\\).\n\nSimilarly, the average value of \\(CDE\\) is the sum of the products of all triples of the zeros divided by the number of triples. The sum of the products of all triples of the zeros is given by the coefficient of \\(x^3\\) (with a sign change) divided by the leading coefficient. For the polynomial \\(f(x)\\), the sum of the products of all triples of the zeros is 5. Therefore, the average value of \\(CDE\\) is \\(\\frac{5}{\\binom{6}{3}} = \\frac{5}{20} = \\frac{1}{4}\\).\n\nThe average value of \\(DEF\\) is the sum of the products of all quadruples of the zeros divided by the number of quadruples. The sum of the products of all quadruples of the zeros is given by the coefficient of \\(x^2\\) (with a sign change) divided by the leading coefficient. For the polynomial \\(f(x)\\), the sum of the products of all quadruples of the zeros is 8. Therefore, the average value of \\(DEF\\) is \\(\\frac{8}{\\binom{6}{4}} = \\frac{8}{15}\\).\n\nThe average value of \\(EFG\\) is the sum of the products of all quintuples of the zeros divided by the number of quintuples. The sum of the products of all quintuples of the zeros is given by the coefficient of \\(x\\) (with a sign change) divided by the leading coefficient. For the polynomial \\(f(x)\\), the sum of the products of all quintuples of the zeros is 13. Therefore, the average value of \\(EFG\\) is \\(\\frac{13}{\\binom{6}{5}} = \\frac{13}{6}\\).\n\nFinally, the average value of \\(FGH\\) is the product of all six zeros, which is given by the constant term of the polynomial (with a sign change) divided by the leading coefficient. For the polynomial \\(f(x)\\), the product of all six zeros is 21. Therefore, the average value of \\(FGH\\) is \\(\\frac{21}{1} = 21\\).\n\nAdding these average values together, we get:\n\\[\n-\\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{5} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{8}{15} + \\frac{13}{6} + 21\n\\]\nTo add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 3, 5, 4, 15, and 6 is 60. Converting each fraction, we get:\n\\[\n-\\frac{20}{60} + \\frac{12}{60} + \\frac{15}{60} + \\frac{32}{60} + \\frac{130}{60} + \\frac{1260}{60} = \\frac{-20 + 12 + 15 + 32 + 130 + 1260}{60} = \\frac{1429}{60}\n\\]\nTherefore, the average value of \\(A + BC + CDE + DEF + EFG + FGH\\) is \\(\\boxed{\\frac{1429}{60}}\\)."

Since 9 is already a perfect square, \\( |A - B| \\) must also be a perfect square. The possible values for \\( |A - B| \\) are the perfect squares that are less than or equal to 9, which are 0, 1, 4, and 9. We will consider each case separately.\n\n1. **Case \\( |A - B| = 0 \\):**\n   \\[ A = B \\]\n   There are 10 possible values for \\( A \\) (and thus \\( B \\)), so there are 10 ordered pairs \\((A, B)\\).\n\n2. **Case \\( |A - B| = 1 \\):**\n   \\[ A = B + 1 \\]\n   Here, \\( A \\) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (since \\( A \\) is a digit from 0 to 9, and \\( A = B + 1 \\) implies \\( B \\) ranges from 0 to 8). For each value of \\( A \\), there is exactly one corresponding value of \\( B \\). Therefore, there are 9 ordered pairs \\((A, B)\\).\n\n3. **Case \\( |A - B| = 4 \\):**\n   \\[ A = B + 4 \\]\n   Here, \\( A \\) can be any digit from 4 to 9 (since \\( A = B + 4 \\) implies \\( B \\) ranges from 0 to 5). For each value of \\( A \\), there is exactly one corresponding value of \\( B \\). Therefore, there are 6 ordered pairs \\((A, B)\\).\n\n4. **Case \\( |A - B| = 9 \\):**\n   \\[ A = B + 9 \\]\n   Here, \\( A \\) can be any digit from 9 to 9 (since \\( A = B + 9 \\) implies \\( B = 0 \\)). For \\( A = 9 \\), there is exactly one corresponding value of \\( B \\). Therefore, there is 1 ordered pair \\((A, B)\\).\n\nAdding up all the cases, we get:\n\\[ 10 + 9 + 6 + 1 = 26 \\]\n\nThus, the number of ordered pairs \\((A, B)\\) such that \\( |r - s| = k^2 \\) for some integer \\( k \\) is \\(\\boxed{26}\\)."

Substituting \\(a = 7\\) into the equation, we get \\(c = 7 - 3 = 4\\).\n\nThe relationship between the semi-major axis \\(a\\), the semi-minor axis \\(b\\), and the distance \\(c\\) from the center to each focus is given by \\(c^2 = a^2 - b^2\\). Substituting the known values, we get:\n\\[\n4^2 = 7^2 - b^2 \\implies 16 = 49 - b^2 \\implies b^2 = 33 \\implies b = \\sqrt{33}.\n\\]\n\nSince the center of the ellipse is \\((7, 7)\\) and the other focus is at \\((d, 7)\\), we have \\(d - 7 = 4\\) or \\(d = 11\\).\n\nThus, the value of \\(d\\) is \\(\\boxed{11}\\)."

            "To solve for the vector from \\(A_1\\) to \\(A_4\\) in terms of the vectors \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}\\), we start by understanding the geometric properties of a regular octagon. In a regular octagon, each internal angle is \\(135^\\circ\\) and each central angle is \\(45^\\circ\\). The vectors \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) can be represented as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\mathbf{u} = A_1A_2 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\mathbf{v} = A_1A_8\n\\]\n\nThe vector \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) points from \\(A_1\\) to \\(A_2\\), and the vector \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) points from \\(A_1\\) to \\(A_8\\). The vector from \\(A_1\\) to \\(A_4\\) can be expressed as a linear combination of \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}\\). To find this combination, we need to consider the symmetry and the angles involved.\n\nIn a regular octagon, the vector from \\(A_1\\) to \\(A_4\\) can be decomposed into components along \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}\\). The vector \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) is a unit vector in the direction of one side of the octagon, and the vector \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) is a unit vector in the direction of the longest diagonal of the octagon, which spans 4 sides.\n\nWe can use the fact that the vector from \\(A_1\\) to \\(A_4\\) can be written as a combination of the vectors \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}\\). By symmetry and geometric properties, we can deduce that:\n\n\\[\n\\mathbf{A_1A_4} = 2\\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{v}\n\\]\n\nTo verify this, we can consider the coordinates of the vertices of the octagon in the complex plane. If we place the octagon in the complex plane with \\(A_1\\) at 1, then the vertices can be represented as the 8th roots of unity scaled by the radius of the circumscribed circle. The vector \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) corresponds to a rotation of \\(45^\\circ\\) and the vector \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) corresponds to a rotation of \\(225^\\circ\\). The vector \\(\\mathbf{A_1A_4}\\) corresponds to a rotation of \\(135^\\circ\\), which is the sum of two \\(45^\\circ\\) rotations plus one \\(45^\\circ\\) rotation.\n\nThus, the vector from \\(A_1\\) to \\(A_4\\) is indeed:\n\n\\[\n\\mathbf{A_1A_4} = 2\\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{v}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the ordered pair \\((a, b)\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{(2, 1)}\n\\]"

            "To find the integer \\( n \\) such that \\( 2009 < n < 3009 \\) and the sum of the odd positive divisors of \\( n \\) is 1024, we start by noting that the sum of the odd positive divisors of \\( n \\) is the same as the sum of the divisors of \\( n \\) after removing all factors of 2. This means that if \\( n = 2^k \\cdot m \\) where \\( m \\) is odd, then the sum of the odd divisors of \\( n \\) is the same as the sum of the divisors of \\( m \\).\n\nWe need to find an odd number \\( m \\) such that the sum of its divisors is 1024. The sum of the divisors of a number \\( m = p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} \\cdots p_k^{e_k} \\) is given by:\n\\[\n\\sigma(m) = (1 + p_1 + p_1^2 + \\cdots + p_1^{e_1})(1 + p_2 + p_2^2 + \\cdots + p_2^{e_2}) \\cdots (1 + p_k + p_k^2 + \\cdots + p_k^{e_k})\n\\]\nWe need to find a combination of prime factors that multiply to 1024. Since 1024 is a power of 2, \\( m \\) must be a power of 2. The only way to get 1024 as a product of sums of powers of a single prime is if \\( m = 2^k \\) and the sum of the divisors of \\( 2^k \\) is \\( 1 + 2 + 2^2 + \\cdots + 2^k = 2^{k+1} - 1 \\). Setting this equal to 1024, we get:\n\\[\n2^{k+1} - 1 = 1024 \\implies 2^{k+1} = 1025\n\\]\nSince 1025 is not a power of 2, we need to consider other factorizations. However, the only factorization of 1024 that involves sums of powers of a single prime is \\( 1024 = 2^{10} \\), which corresponds to \\( m = 1024 \\).

Let's try \\( k = 4 \\), so \\( 2^{k+1} - 1 = 2^5 - 1 = 31 \\). Then we need:\n\\[\n31 \\cdot \\frac{3^{a+1} - 1}{2} = 1024 \\implies 3^{a+1} - 1 = \\frac{1024 \\cdot 2}{31} = \\frac{2048}{31} = 66\n\\]\nSo, \\( 3^{a+1} = 67 \\), which is not a power of 3. Let's try \\( k = 5 \\), so \\( 2^{k+1} - 1 = 2^6 - 1 = 63 \\). Then we need:\n\\[\n63 \\cdot \\frac{3^{a+1} - 1}{2} = 1024 \\implies 3^{a+1} - 1 = \\frac{1024 \\cdot 2}{63} = \\frac{2048}{63} = 32.6032\n\\]\nThis is not an integer, so \\( k = 5 \\) is not a solution. Let's try \\( k = 6 \\), so \\( 2^{k+1} - 1 = 2^7 - 1 = 127 \\). Then we need:\n\\[\n127 \\cdot \\frac{3^{a+1} - 1}{2} = 1024 \\implies 3^{a+1} - 1 = \\frac{1024 \\cdot 2}{127} = \\frac{2048}{127} = 16\n\\]\nSo, \\( 3^{a+1} = 17 \\), which is not a power of 3.

We can use the Rational Root Theorem to test possible rational roots, which are the factors of \\(-50\\) divided by the factors of \\(1\\).

We can now factor \\(a^3 - 15a^2 + 20a - 50\\) as \\((a - 5)(a^2 - 10a + 10)\\).

According to Vieta's formulas, for a polynomial \\( x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c \\) with roots \\( r_1, r_2, r_3 \\), the following relationships hold:\n1. \\( r_1 + r_2 + r_3 = -a \\)\n2. \\( r_1r_2 + r_2r_3 + r_3r_1 = b \\)\n3. \\( r_1r_2r_3 = -c \\)\n\nFor our polynomial \\( T(x) = x^3 + x^2 + Bx + C \\), the roots are \\( 2\\alpha \\), \\( \\cos^2 \\alpha \\), and \\( -\\csc^2 \\alpha \\). Therefore, we have:\n1. \\( 2\\alpha + \\cos^2 \\alpha - \\csc^2 \\alpha = -1 \\)\n2. \\( (2\\alpha)(\\cos^2 \\alpha) + (\\cos^2 \\alpha)(-\\csc^2 \\alpha) + (-\\csc^2 \\alpha)(2\\alpha) = B \\)\n3. \\( (2\\alpha)(\\cos^2 \\alpha)(-\\csc^2 \\alpha) = -C \\)\n\nFirst, we simplify the sum of the roots:\n\\[ 2\\alpha + \\cos^2 \\alpha - \\csc^2 \\alpha = -1 \\]\nSince \\( \\csc^2 \\alpha = \\frac{1}{\\sin^2 \\alpha} \\) and \\( \\cos^2 \\alpha = 1 - \\sin^2 \\alpha \\), we can rewrite the equation as:\n\\[ 2\\alpha + (1 - \\sin^2 \\alpha) - \\frac{1}{\\sin^2 \\alpha} = -1 \\]\n\\[ 2\\alpha + 1 - \\sin^2 \\alpha - \\frac{1}{\\sin^2 \\alpha} = -1 \\]\n\\[ 2\\alpha + 2 = \\sin^2 \\alpha + \\frac{1}{\\sin^2 \\alpha} \\]\nLet \\( y = \\sin^2 \\alpha \\). Then the equation becomes:\n\\[ 2\\alpha + 2 = y + \\frac{1}{y} \\]\nSince \\( y = \\sin^2 \\alpha \\) and \\( 0 < y \\leq 1 \\), we need to find a value of \\( y \\) that satisfies this equation. By inspection or numerical methods, we find that \\( y = 1 \\) is a solution, which means \\( \\sin^2 \\alpha = 1 \\) and thus \\( \\alpha = \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\) (or any odd multiple of \\( \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\)). However, since \\( \\alpha \\) is a real number, we can use \\( \\alpha = \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\) for simplicity.\n\nNow, we substitute \\( \\alpha = \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\) back into the roots:\n\\[ 2\\alpha = 2 \\cdot \\frac{\\pi}{2} = \\pi \\]\n\\[ \\cos^2 \\alpha = \\cos^2 \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\right) = 0 \\]\n\\[ -\\csc^2 \\alpha = -\\csc^2 \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\right) = -1 \\]\nSo the roots are \\( \\pi \\), \\( 0 \\), and \\( -1 \\).\n\nNext, we use Vieta's formulas to find \\( B \\) and \\( C \\):\n\\[ B = \\pi \\cdot 0 + 0 \\cdot (-1) + (-1) \\cdot \\pi = -\\pi \\]\n\\[ C = -(\\pi \\cdot 0 \\cdot (-1)) = 0 \\]\n\nThus, the polynomial \\( T(x) \\) is:\n\\[ T(x) = x^3 + x^2 - \\pi x \\]\n\nFinally, we compute \\( T(5) \\):\n\\[ T(5) = 5^3 + 5^2 - \\pi \\cdot 5 = 125 + 25 - 5\\pi = 150 - 5\\pi \\]\n\nTherefore, the value of \\( T(5) \\) is:\n\\[ \\boxed{150 - 5\\pi} \\]"

Let's analyze the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Identify the total number of triangles:**\n   A hexagon has 6 vertices, and the number of triangles that can be formed by choosing any 3 vertices out of 6 is given by the combination formula \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n2. **Condition for the coloring:**\n   Each triangle must have at least one red side. This means that if we color the sides of the hexagon such that no triangle has all three sides blue, we have a valid coloring.\n\n3. **Consider the diagonals:**\n   The hexagon has 9 diagonals. If we color all the diagonals blue, then any triangle formed by the vertices of the hexagon will have all three sides blue, which is not allowed. Therefore, we need to ensure that at least one of the sides of each triangle is red.\n\n4. **Use the principle of complementary counting:**\n   Instead of directly counting the valid colorings, we can count the invalid colorings and subtract them from the total number of colorings. An invalid coloring is one where at least one triangle has all three sides blue.\n\n5. **Count the invalid colorings:**\n   If a triangle has all three sides blue, then the other sides of the hexagon can be colored in any way. However, we need to ensure that this does not happen for any triangle. The only way to have an invalid coloring is if we color all the diagonals blue, which is not possible since it would violate the condition that every triangle must have at least one red side.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   Since it is impossible to have an invalid coloring (i.e., a coloring where all diagonals are blue), all colorings of the hexagon's sides and diagonals are valid. Therefore, the number of valid colorings is simply the number of ways to color the 9 diagonals either red or blue, which is \\(2^9 = 512\\).\n\nThus, the number of colorings such that every triangle \\(A_i A_j A_k\\) has at least one red side is \\(\\boxed{512}\\)."

            "To find the largest \\(K\\)-digit number which has distinct digits and is a multiple of 63, we first need to determine the value of \\(K\\). Given \\(T = 3\\), we have \\(K = T + 2 = 3 + 2 = 5\\). Therefore, we need to find the largest 5-digit number with distinct digits that is a multiple of 63.\n\nA number is a multiple of 63 if and only if it is a multiple of both 7 and 9. A number is a multiple of 9 if the sum of its digits is a multiple of 9. A number is a multiple of 7 if it satisfies the divisibility rule for 7.\n\nFirst, we find the largest 5-digit number with distinct digits, which is 98765. We check if 98765 is a multiple of 9 by summing its digits:\n\\[9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 = 35.\\]\nSince 35 is not a multiple of 9, 98765 is not a multiple of 9, and therefore not a multiple of 63.\n\nNext, we check the next largest number with distinct digits, which is 98764. We sum its digits:\n\\[9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 4 = 34.\\]\nSince 34 is not a multiple of 9, 98764 is not a multiple of 9, and therefore not a multiple of 63.\n\nWe continue this process until we find a number that is a multiple of 9. The next number to check is 98763. We sum its digits:\n\\[9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 3 = 33.\\]\nSince 33 is not a multiple of 9, 98763 is not a multiple of 9, and therefore not a multiple of 63.\n\nThe next number to check is 98760. We sum its digits:\n\\[9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 0 = 30.\\]\nSince 30 is not a multiple of 9, 98760 is not a multiple of 9, and therefore not a multiple of 63.\n\nThe next number to check is 98754. We sum its digits:\n\\[9 + 8 + 7 + 5 + 4 = 33.\\]\nSince 33 is not a multiple of 9, 98754 is not a multiple of 9, and therefore not a multiple of 63.\n\nThe next number to check is 98751. We sum its digits:\n\\[9 + 8 + 7 + 5 + 1 = 30.\\]\nSince 30 is not a multiple of 9, 98751 is not a multiple of 9, and therefore not a multiple of 63.\n\nThe next number to check is 98742. We sum its digits:\n\\[9 + 8 + 7 + 4 + 2 = 30.\\]\nSince 30 is not a multiple of 9, 98742 is not a multiple of 9, and therefore not a multiple of 63.\n\nThe next number to check is 98736. We sum its digits:\n\\[9 + 8 + 7 + 3 + 6 = 33.\\]\nSince 33 is not a multiple of 9, 98736 is not a multiple of 9, and therefore not a multiple of 63.\n\nThe next number to check is 98721. We sum its digits:\n\\[9 + 8 + 7 + 2 + 1 = 27.\\]\nSince 27 is a multiple of 9, 98721 is a multiple of 9. Now we check if 98721 is a multiple of 7:\n\\[98721 \\div 7 = 14103.\\]\nSince 14103 is an integer, 98721 is a multiple of 7. Therefore, 98721 is a multiple of 63.\n\nThus, the largest 5-digit number with distinct digits that is a multiple of 63 is \\(\\boxed{98721}\\)."

            "To determine the probability that no three faces of the same color share a common vertex on a cube, we need to consider the possible colorings of the cube's faces and identify which of these colorings meet the given condition.\n\nFirst, let's understand the structure of the cube. A cube has 6 faces, and each face is adjacent to 4 other faces. The condition we need to satisfy is that no three faces of the same color share a common vertex. This means that if we color three faces that share a common vertex with the same color, it would violate the condition.\n\nWe can start by noting that if we color three faces that share a common vertex with the same color, the fourth face adjacent to these three faces must be colored differently to avoid having three faces of the same color sharing a common vertex. This implies that the cube must be colored in such a way that no three faces sharing a vertex are all the same color.\n\nOne way to approach this is to consider the possible colorings of the cube. If we color one face red, then the four faces adjacent to it must be blue to avoid having three red faces sharing a vertex. This leaves the last face, which is opposite to the initially colored face, can be either red or blue. However, if it is red, then the four faces adjacent to it must be blue, which would violate the condition because it would have three blue faces sharing a vertex. Therefore, the last face must be blue.\n\nThis means that if we start with one face colored red, the opposite face must be blue, and the four faces adjacent to the red face must be blue. This is one valid coloring. By symmetry, we can also start with one face colored blue, and the opposite face must be red, with the four faces adjacent to the blue face being red. This is another valid coloring.\n\nThese are the only two valid colorings of the cube that satisfy the condition. Since each face can be either red or blue with equal probability, there are \\(2^6 = 64\\) possible colorings of the cube.\n\nTherefore, the probability that no three faces of the same color share a common vertex is the number of valid colorings divided by the total number of possible colorings:\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{64} = \\frac{1}{32}\n\\]\n\nThus, the probability is \\(\\boxed{\\frac{1}{32}}\\)."

We need to find the length of \\(BC\\), given that \\(AC\\) and \\(AD\\) are relatively prime.\n\nFirst, let's denote the side lengths of the triangle as follows:\n- \\(AB = c\\)\n- \\(BC = a\\)\n- \\(CA = b\\)\n\nSince \\(AD = 229\\) and \\(D\\) is the point where the angle bisector of \\(\\angle ACB\\) meets \\(AB\\), by the Angle Bisector Theorem, we have:\n\\[\n\\frac{AD}{DB} = \\frac{AC}{BC} = \\frac{b}{a}\n\\]\nLet \\(DB = x\\). Then, \\(AB = AD + DB = 229 + x = c\\), so \\(x = c - 229\\). Therefore, the Angle Bisector Theorem gives us:\n\\[\n\\frac{229}{c - 229} = \\frac{b}{a}\n\\]\nThis can be rearranged to:\n\\[\n229a = b(c - 229)\n\\]\nor\n\\[\nbc = 229a + 229b\n\\]\nThe perimeter of the triangle is given by:\n\\[\na + b + c = 2019\n\\]\nWe can express \\(c\\) as \\(c = 2019 - a - b\\).

Also, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are relatively prime, \\(b\\) must be a divisor of 229. The prime factorization of 229 is \\(229\\), so the possible values for \\(b\\) are 1 and 229. However, \\(b = 229\\) would make \\(a = 1\\), which is not possible because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) must be distinct and the triangle inequality must be satisfied. Therefore, \\(b = 1\\).\n\nSubstituting \\(b = 1\\) into the equation \\(bc = 229a + 229b\\), we get:\n\\[\n1 \\cdot c = 229a + 229 \\cdot 1\n\\]\n\\[\nc = 229a + 229\n\\]\nSubstituting \\(c = 229a + 229\\) into the perimeter equation \\(a + b + c = 2019\\), we get:\n\\[\na + 1 + 229a + 229 = 2019\n\\]\n\\[\n230a + 230 = 2019\n\\]\n\\[\n230a = 1789\n\\]\n\\[\na = \\frac{1789}{230}\n\\]\nSince \\(a\\) must be an integer, we check the divisibility.

            "To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the given parallelogram \\(A R M L\\) and the points \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) which are the midpoints of sides \\(\\overline{R M}\\) and \\(\\overline{A L}\\), respectively. Since \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) are midpoints, \\(PQ\\) is parallel to \\(AL\\) and \\(AR\\) and half their lengths. Therefore, \\(PQ\\) is a midsegment of the parallelogram, and it is parallel to the diagonals \\(AL\\) and \\(AR\\).\n\nGiven that \\(P X = 3\\), \\(R X = 4\\), and \\(P R = 5\\), we can deduce that \\(P R\\) is the hypotenuse of the right triangle \\(P X R\\), because \\(3^2 + 4^2 = 5^2\\). This means that \\(PQ\\) is perpendicular to \\(PR\\).\n\nNext, we need to find the area of \\(\\triangle PQR\\) and \\(\\triangle LIP\\). Since \\(PQ\\) is parallel to \\(AL\\) and \\(AR\\), and \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) are midpoints, the height from \\(R\\) to \\(PQ\\) is half the height of the parallelogram from \\(R\\) to \\(AL\\). Let the height of the parallelogram be \\(h\\). Then the height from \\(R\\) to \\(PQ\\) is \\(\\frac{h}{2}\\).\n\nThe area of \\(\\triangle PQR\\) is:\n\\[\n[ PQR ] = \\frac{1}{2} \\times PQ \\times \\frac{h}{2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{AL}{2} \\times \\frac{h}{2} = \\frac{1}{8} \\times AL \\times h\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to find the area of \\(\\triangle LIP\\). Since \\(I\\) is the midpoint of \\(AL\\) (because \\(I A = I L\\)), \\(I\\) is also the midpoint of \\(AL\\). Therefore, \\(I\\) is the same point as \\(P\\), and the area of \\(\\triangle LIP\\) is zero. However, this interpretation is incorrect because \\(I\\) is not the same point as \\(P\\). Instead, we need to consider the correct position of \\(I\\) on \\(AL\\).\n\nSince \\(I\\) is the midpoint of \\(AL\\), the area of \\(\\triangle LIP\\) is:\n\\[\n[ LIP ] = \\frac{1}{2} \\times L I \\times \\text{height from } P \\text{ to } AL = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{AL}{2} \\times \\frac{h}{2} = \\frac{1}{8} \\times AL \\times h\n\\]\n\nHowever, the correct interpretation is that \\(I\\) is not the midpoint of \\(AL\\) but a point on \\(AL\\) such that \\(I A = I L\\). The correct area of \\(\\triangle LIP\\) is:\n\\[\n[ LIP ] = \\frac{1}{2} \\times L I \\times \\text{height from } P \\text{ to } AL = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{AL}{2} \\times \\frac{h}{2} = \\frac{1}{8} \\times AL \\times h\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible value of \\(\\frac{[ PQR ]}{[ LIP ]}\\) is:\n\\[\n\\frac{[ PQR ]}{[ LIP ]} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{8} \\times AL \\times h}{\\frac{1}{8} \\times AL \\times h} = 2\n\\]\n\nThus, the maximum possible value is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{2}\n\\]"

We will analyze the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the parity of the number of flips. Each switch can be flipped an odd number of times to turn it on. Since Elizabeth flips 5 switches each minute, the total number of flips after \\( m \\) minutes is \\( 5m \\). For all 9 switches to be on, each switch must be flipped an odd number of times. The sum of 9 odd numbers is odd, so \\( 5m \\) must be odd. This implies that \\( m \\) must be odd.\n\nNext, we need to check if it is possible to flip all switches to on in the minimum number of odd minutes. Let's start with \\( m = 1 \\):\n- In one minute, Elizabeth can flip 5 switches. This leaves 4 switches off and 4 switches on.

We need to check if it is possible to flip all 9 switches to on in 3 minutes. We can use a systematic approach to see if it is possible.\n\nConsider the following sequence of flips:\n1.

Each minute, Elizabeth flips exactly 2 switches, and we need to find the minimum number of minutes required to have all \\( n \\) switches on.\n\nFirst, let's consider the parity of the number of flips. Since each switch is flipped exactly once every two minutes, the parity (odd or even) of the number of flips for each switch will determine whether it ends up on or off. Specifically, a switch will be on if it is flipped an odd number of times, and off if it is flipped an even number of times.\n\nFor \\( n \\) to be even, let \\( n = 2m \\).

For all \\( 2m \\) switches to be on, \\( 2t \\) must be at least \\( 2m \\) (since each switch must be flipped at least once). The smallest \\( t \\) that satisfies this is \\( t = m \\), because \\( 2m \\) flips will ensure each switch is flipped an odd number of times (specifically, each switch will be flipped exactly once).\n\nTo verify, consider the following sequence of flips:\n- In the first minute, flip switches 1 and 2.\n- In the second minute, flip switches 3 and 4.\n- Continue this pattern until the \\( m \\)-th minute, where you flip switches \\( 2m-1 \\) and \\( 2m \\).\n\nAfter \\( m \\) minutes, each of the \\( 2m \\) switches will have been flipped exactly once, and thus all switches will be on.

The goal is to find the minimum number of minutes required for Elizabeth to flip all 2020 light switches to on, given that she flips exactly 1993 switches each minute.\n\nFirst, let's consider the parity of the number of flips. Each switch can be flipped an odd or even number of times. If a switch is flipped an odd number of times, it will be on at the end. If it is flipped an even number of times, it will be off at the end. Since Elizabeth flips 1993 switches each minute, the total number of flips after \\( m \\) minutes is \\( 1993m \\). This means that each switch will be flipped \\( 1993m \\mod 2020 \\) times. For a switch to be on at the end, \\( 1993m \\mod 2020 \\) must be odd. Since 1993 is odd and 2020 is even, \\( 1993m \\mod 2020 \\) will be odd if and only if \\( m \\) is odd. Therefore, for all switches to be on at the end, \\( m \\) must be odd.\n\nNext, we need to determine the smallest odd \\( m \\) such that \\( 1993m \\) is a multiple of 2020. This is equivalent to finding the smallest odd \\( m \\) such that \\( 1993m \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2020} \\). Since 1993 and 2020 are coprime (they have no common factors other than 1), the smallest \\( m \\) that satisfies this condition is the least common multiple of 2020 and 1993, which is 2020 itself, but since we need \\( m \\) to be odd, we take the smallest odd multiple of 2020, which is 2020 itself (since 2020 is even, the next odd multiple is 2020 * 1 = 2020).\n\nThus, the smallest \\( m \\) that satisfies the condition is 2020. Therefore, the minimum number of minutes required for Elizabeth to escape is \\( E(2020, 1993) = 2020 \\).\n\nThe answer is \\(\\boxed{2020}\\)."

            "To determine \\( E(2001, 501) \\), we need to analyze the problem of flipping light switches in such a way that all switches are on at the end of a certain number of minutes. Let's start by understanding the nature of the problem.\n\nEach minute, Elizabeth flips exactly 501 out of the 2001 switches. We need to find the minimum number of minutes required for all 2001 switches to be on. Let's denote the state of the switches by a binary vector of length 2001, where 0 represents an off switch and 1 represents an on switch.\n\nThe key observation is that flipping a switch an even number of times results in the switch being off again, and flipping a switch an odd number of times results in the switch being on. Therefore, we need to find a sequence of flips such that each switch is flipped an odd number of times.\n\nWe can represent the flipping of switches as a linear transformation over the field of integers modulo 2. Each flip can be represented as a vector in \\(\\mathbb{F}_2^{2001}\\), and the problem reduces to finding a linear combination of 501-dimensional vectors that sums to the all-ones vector (1, 1, ..., 1).\n\nThe problem is equivalent to finding the minimum number of 501-dimensional vectors that sum to the all-ones vector in \\(\\mathbb{F}_2^{2001}\\). This is a classic problem in linear algebra and combinatorics, and it is known that the minimum number of such vectors is given by the smallest integer \\( m \\) such that \\( 501m \\geq 2001 \\).\n\nTo find this \\( m \\), we solve the inequality:\n\\[ 501m \\geq 2001 \\]\n\\[ m \\geq \\frac{2001}{501} \\]\n\\[ m \\geq 4 \\]\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of minutes required for Elizabeth to escape is 4. We can verify that 4 minutes is sufficient by noting that flipping 501 switches in each of the first 3 minutes will result in each switch being flipped at least 3 times (an odd number of times), and flipping 501 switches in the fourth minute will ensure that each switch is flipped an additional odd number of times, making the total number of flips for each switch an odd number of times, thus turning all switches on.\n\nThus, the value of \\( E(2001, 501) \\) is \\(\\boxed{4}\\)."

Let's denote the students by \\( S_1, S_2, \\ldots, S_8 \\).\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of pairs of students. The number of ways to choose 2 students out of 8 is given by the binomial coefficient:\n\\[\n\\binom{8}{2} = \\frac{8 \\times 7}{2 \\times 1} = 28\n\\]\nSo, there are 28 pairs of students.\n\nNext, we need to determine how many pairs are covered by each special case of a simulation (either 2 or 3 students in the picture).\n\n1. **Case 1: Two students in the picture**\n   - If we have a picture with 2 students, it covers exactly 1 pair.\n   - To cover all 28 pairs, we need at least 28 pictures, but this is not the minimum because we can use pictures with 3 students to cover more pairs efficiently.\n\n2. **Case 2: Three students in the picture**\n   - If we have a picture with 3 students, it covers \\(\\binom{3}{2} = 3\\) pairs.\n   - To minimize the number of pictures, we should use as many 3-student pictures as possible.\n\nLet's denote the number of 3-student pictures by \\( x \\) and the number of 2-student pictures by \\( y \\).

First, subtract the first equation from the second:\n\n\\[\n(2a + 3b + 2c) - (3a + 2b + 2c) = 24 - 12 \\implies -a + b = 12 \\implies b = a + 12.\n\\]\n\nNext, subtract the first equation from the third:\n\n\\[\n(2a + 2b + 3c) - (3a + 2b + 2c) = 30 - 12 \\implies -a + c = 18 \\implies c = a + 18.\n\\]\n\nNow substitute \\(b = a + 12\\) and \\(c = a + 18\\) into the first equation:\n\n\\[\n3a + 2(a + 12) + 2(a + 18) = 12 \\implies 3a + 2a + 24 + 2a + 36 = 12 \\implies 7a + 60 = 12 \\implies 7a = -48 \\implies a = -\\frac{48}{7}.\n\\]\n\nThen, \\(b = a + 12 = -\\frac{48}{7} + 12 = -\\frac{48}{7} + \\frac{84}{7} = \\frac{36}{7}\\) and \\(c = a + 18 = -\\frac{48}{7} + 18 = -\\frac{48}{7} + \\frac{126}{7} = \\frac{78}{7}\\).\n\nThus, \\(x = 2^a = 2^{-\\frac{48}{7}}\\), \\(y = 2^b = 2^{\\frac{36}{7}}\\), and \\(z = 2^c = 2^{\\frac{78}{7}}\\).

            "To find the least positive integer \\( n \\) such that the sum of the digits of \\( n \\) is five times the sum of the digits of \\( n+2019 \\), we start by letting \\( S(n) \\) denote the sum of the digits of \\( n \\). The problem can be expressed as:\n\\[ S(n) = 5S(n+2019). \\]\n\nFirst, we need to understand how the sum of the digits changes when we add 2019 to \\( n \\). The number 2019 has digits 2, 0, 1, and 9, so adding 2019 to \\( n \\) will affect the digits of \\( n \\) in a way that depends on the specific digits of \\( n \\).\n\nLet's consider the possible values of \\( n \\) modulo 9. The sum of the digits of a number is congruent to the number itself modulo 9. Therefore, we have:\n\\[ n \\equiv S(n) \\pmod{9} \\]\nand\n\\[ n + 2019 \\equiv S(n+2019) \\pmod{9}. \\]\nSince \\( 2019 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{9} \\), we get:\n\\[ n + 2019 \\equiv n + 3 \\pmod{9}. \\]\nThus,\n\\[ S(n+2019) \\equiv n + 3 \\pmod{9}. \\]\nSubstituting this into the original equation, we get:\n\\[ S(n) \\equiv 5(n + 3) \\pmod{9}. \\]\nSince \\( S(n) \\equiv n \\pmod{9} \\), we can substitute \\( S(n) \\) with \\( n \\) in the congruence:\n\\[ n \\equiv 5(n + 3) \\pmod{9}. \\]\nSimplifying the right-hand side, we get:\n\\[ n \\equiv 5n + 15 \\pmod{9}. \\]\nSubtracting \\( 5n \\) from both sides, we get:\n\\[ -4n \\equiv 15 \\pmod{9}. \\]\nSince \\( -4 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{9} \\), we can rewrite the congruence as:\n\\[ 5n \\equiv 15 \\pmod{9}. \\]\nSimplifying 15 modulo 9, we get:\n\\[ 5n \\equiv 6 \\pmod{9}. \\]\nTo solve for \\( n \\), we need the multiplicative inverse of 5 modulo 9. The inverse of 5 modulo 9 is a number \\( x \\) such that:\n\\[ 5x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{9}. \\]\nBy testing values, we find that \\( x = 2 \\) works because:\n\\[ 5 \\cdot 2 = 10 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{9}. \\]\nThus, we multiply both sides of the congruence \\( 5n \\equiv 6 \\pmod{9} \\) by 2:\n\\[ n \\equiv 12 \\pmod{9}. \\]\nSince \\( 12 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{9} \\), we have:\n\\[ n \\equiv 3 \\pmod{9}. \\]\nThis means that \\( n \\) can be written in the form:\n\\[ n = 9k + 3 \\]\nfor some integer \\( k \\).

The sum of the series \\(2 + 3 + \\cdots + 2n\\) is:\n\\[\n2 + 3 + \\cdots + 2n = \\sum_{k=1}^n (2k) = 2 \\sum_{k=1}^n k = 2 \\cdot \\frac{n(n+1)}{2} = n(n+1).\n\\]\nThe sum of the series \\(4 + 5 + \\cdots + 4n\\) is:\n\\[\n4 + 5 + \\cdots + 4n = \\sum_{k=1}^n (4k) = 4 \\sum_{k=1}^n k = 4 \\cdot \\frac{n(n+1)}{2} = 2n(n+1).\n\\]\nTherefore, the required ratio is:\n\\[\n\\frac{2+3+\\cdots+2n}{4+5+\\cdots+4n} = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2n(n+1)} = \\frac{1}{2}.\n\\]\nThus, the answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}.\n\\]"

            "To find the largest possible sum of the 15 answers in an arithmetic progression with the largest possible difference, we need to maximize the difference between the answers. The answers range from 000 to 999, so the largest possible difference between any two answers is 999. Let's denote the first term of the arithmetic progression by \\(a\\) and the common difference by \\(d\\). The 15th term of the arithmetic progression can be expressed as \\(a + 14d\\). Since the answers must be within the range 000 to 999, we have the following constraints:\n\\[0 \\leq a \\leq 999 - 14d.\\]\nTo maximize the sum of the answers, we should choose the largest possible value for \\(d\\). The largest possible value for \\(d\\) is 999, but this would make the 15th term \\(a + 14 \\cdot 999 = a + 13986\\), which is much larger than 999. Therefore, we need to find the largest \\(d\\) such that \\(a + 14d \\leq 999\\). The largest possible \\(d\\) is 69, because if \\(d = 70\\), then \\(a + 14 \\cdot 70 = a + 980\\) and the largest possible \\(a\\) would be 0, making the 15th term 980, which is still within the range, but if \\(d = 71\\), then \\(a + 14 \\cdot 71 = a + 994\\) and the largest possible \\(a\\) would be 0, making the 15th term 994, but if \\(d = 72\\), then \\(a + 14 \\cdot 72 = a + 1008\\) and the largest possible \\(a\\) would be -9, which is not within the range. Therefore, the largest possible \\(d\\) is 69.\nIf \\(d = 69\\), then the 15th term is \\(a + 14 \\cdot 69 = a + 966\\). To maximize the sum, we choose the largest possible value for \\(a\\), which is 999 - 966 = 33. Therefore, the arithmetic progression is \\(33, 102, 171, \\ldots, 966\\). The sum of an arithmetic progression is given by the formula:\n\\[S = \\frac{n}{2} (2a + (n-1)d),\\]\nwhere \\(n\\) is the number of terms, \\(a\\) is the first term, and \\(d\\) is the common difference. Substituting the values, we get:\n\\[S = \\frac{15}{2} (2 \\cdot 33 + (15-1) \\cdot 69) = \\frac{15}{2} (66 + 972) = \\frac{15}{2} \\cdot 1038 = 15 \\cdot 519 = 7785.\\]\nTherefore, the largest possible sum of the 15 answers is \\(\\boxed{7785}\\)."

The points of intersection are found by solving the equation \\( 4x = 10\\pi \\sin^2 x \\).\n\nFirst, let's analyze the behavior of the functions. The function \\( y = 4x \\) is a straight line passing through the origin with a slope of 4. The function \\( y = 10\\pi \\sin^2 x \\) is a periodic function with a maximum value of \\( 10\\pi \\) and a minimum value of 0. The maximum value of \\( \\sin^2 x \\) is 1, so the maximum value of \\( y = 10\\pi \\sin^2 x \\) is \\( 10\\pi \\).\n\nTo find the points of intersection, we need to solve \\( 4x = 10\\pi \\sin^2 x \\). This equation is transcendental and generally does not have a simple algebraic solution. However, we can use numerical methods or graphical methods to find the approximate solutions. By plotting the functions, we can see that there are two points of intersection in the first quadrant, approximately at \\( x \\approx 0 \\) and \\( x \\approx 2.5 \\).\n\nTo find the exact points of intersection, we can use numerical methods such as the Newton-Raphson method or a graphing calculator. For the purpose of this problem, we will assume the points of intersection are \\( x_1 \\) and \\( x_2 \\) where \\( x_1 \\approx 0 \\) and \\( x_2 \\approx 2.5 \\).\n\nThe length of the segment of the line \\( y = 4x \\) between \\( x = x_1 \\) and \\( x = x_2 \\) is given by the distance formula for the line segment:\n\\[\n\\text{Length} = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (4x_2 - 4x_1)^2} = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + 16(x_2 - x_1)^2} = \\sqrt{17(x_2 - x_1)^2} = \\sqrt{17} |x_2 - x_1|.\n\\]\nSince \\( x_1 \\approx 0 \\) and \\( x_2 \\approx 2.5 \\), we have \\( x_2 - x_1 \\approx 2.5 \\). Therefore, the length of the segment is:\n\\[\n\\text{Length} = \\sqrt{17} \\cdot 2.5 = \\frac{5\\sqrt{17}}{2}.\n\\]\n\nThus, the sum of the lengths of all the segments of the graph of \\( y = 4x \\) that lie in the first quadrant and below the graph of \\( y = 10\\pi \\sin^2 x \\) is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{5\\sqrt{17}}{2}}.\n\\]"

However, a more straightforward approach is to recognize that the hexagon can be divided into two congruent trapezoids by drawing the diagonal \\(BE\\). Since \\(BE = 3\\) and the hexagon is equilateral, we can use the properties of the equilateral triangles formed by drawing the diagonals.\n\nThe hexagon can be divided into two congruent trapezoids, each with a height that can be found using the properties of the equilateral triangles. The height of each of these triangles is the same as the height of the equilateral triangle formed by the diagonal \\(BE\\) and the sides of the hexagon.\n\nThe area of an equilateral triangle with side length \\(s\\) is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2\n\\]\n\nSince the hexagon is composed of two such triangles, the area of the hexagon is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = 2 \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2 = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} s^2\n\\]\n\nTo find \\(s\\), we use the fact that the diagonal \\(BE\\) forms two 30-60-90 triangles with the sides of the hexagon. In a 30-60-90 triangle, the ratio of the sides opposite the 30-degree, 60-degree, and 90-degree angles is \\(1 : \\sqrt{3} : 2\\). Therefore, if we let the side length of the hexagon be \\(s\\), the length of the diagonal \\(BE\\) is \\(s\\sqrt{3}\\). Given that \\(BE = 3\\), we have:\n\n\\[\ns\\sqrt{3} = 3 \\implies s = \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\sqrt{3}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\(s = \\sqrt{3}\\) into the area formula, we get:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} (\\sqrt{3})^2 = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\times 3 = \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2}\n\\]\n\nThus, the area of the hexagon \\(ABCDEF\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{9\\sqrt{3}}{2}}\n\\]"

            "To determine the number of noncongruent triangles that can be formed by extending three sides of a regular 16-gon, we need to consider the vertices of the 16-gon and how they can be used to form the triangles.\n\nA regular 16-gon has 16 vertices. When we extend three sides of the 16-gon, we form a triangle by connecting three vertices of the 16-gon such that no two vertices of the triangle are adjacent vertices of the 16-gon. This means that the vertices of the triangle must be separated by at least one vertex of the 16-gon.\n\nWe can represent the vertices of the 16-gon as \\(A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_{16}\\). If we choose three vertices \\(A_i, A_j, A_k\\) to form the triangle, then the condition is that the vertices are not adjacent, i.e., the difference between any two of the indices (considering the indices modulo 16) must be at least 2. This means that if we choose \\(A_i\\), the next vertex we can choose is \\(A_{i+2}\\) or later, and so on.\n\nTo count the number of noncongruent triangles, we need to count the number of distinct sets of three vertices that satisfy this condition. We can use the fact that the problem of counting noncongruent triangles formed by extending sides of a regular polygon is equivalent to counting the number of distinct ways to choose three vertices from 16 such that no two vertices are adjacent.\n\nThis is a combinatorial problem that can be solved using the principle of inclusion-exclusion or by direct counting. The number of ways to choose 3 vertices from 16 such that no two vertices are adjacent is given by the formula for the number of ways to choose 3 elements from 13 (since we can think of \"gaps\" between the chosen vertices to ensure they are not adjacent).\n\nThe number of ways to choose 3 vertices from 16 such that no two vertices are adjacent is \\(\\binom{13}{3} = 286\\). However, this counts all possible sets of 3 vertices, and we need to ensure that the triangles formed are noncongruent. Since the 16-gon is regular, all triangles formed by choosing 3 vertices such that no two are adjacent are congruent to each other. Therefore, the number of noncongruent triangles is simply the number of distinct sets of 3 vertices that satisfy the condition, which is 286.\n\nThus, the number of noncongruent triangles that can be formed is \\(\\boxed{56}\\)."

            "To solve the problem, we start by noting that each square tile has an area of 9, so the side length of each square is \\( \\sqrt{9} = 3 \\). When the top tile is rotated by an acute angle \\( \\theta \\) about its center, the area of the overlapping region is given as 8. We need to find \\( \\sin \\theta + \\cos \\theta \\).\n\nFirst, let's consider the geometry of the overlapping region. When two squares of side length 3 are rotated relative to each other, the area of the overlapping region can be expressed in terms of the angle of rotation \\( \\theta \\). The area of the overlapping region is given by the formula:\n\n\\[\nA = 9 - 9 \\cos \\theta - 9 \\cos \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\theta \\right) + 9 \\cos \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{2} - 2\\theta \\right)\n\\]\n\nHowever, a simpler approach is to use the fact that the area of the overlapping region is 8. The area of the overlapping region can also be expressed as the area of the original square minus the area of the two non-overlapping triangles. The area of each non-overlapping triangle is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area of one triangle} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 3 \\times 3 \\times \\sin \\theta = \\frac{9}{2} \\sin \\theta\n\\]\n\nSince there are two such triangles, the total area of the non-overlapping region is:\n\n\\[\n2 \\times \\frac{9}{2} \\sin \\theta = 9 \\sin \\theta\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the area of the overlapping region is:\n\n\\[\n9 - 9 \\sin \\theta = 8\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( \\sin \\theta \\), we get:\n\n\\[\n9 - 9 \\sin \\theta = 8 \\implies 9 \\sin \\theta = 1 \\implies \\sin \\theta = \\frac{1}{9}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find \\( \\cos \\theta \\).
