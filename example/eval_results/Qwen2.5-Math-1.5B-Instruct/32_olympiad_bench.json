We are asked to find the difference between the number of positive integers at most \\(2^{2017}\\) with even weight and the number of positive integers at most \\(2^{2017}\\) with odd weight.\n\nFirst, note that the numbers from 1 to \\(2^{2017} - 1\\) can be represented as 2017-bit binary numbers (since \\(2^{2017}\\) is a 2018-bit number, but we are considering numbers up to \\(2^{2017} - 1\\), which is a 2017-bit number).\n\nThe total number of 2017-bit numbers is \\(2^{2017}\\). Half of these numbers will have an even weight and the other half will have an odd weight. This is because for any 2017-bit number, flipping the last bit (which is the most significant bit in the context of the range from 0 to \\(2^{2017} - 1\\)) changes the parity of the weight. Therefore, the number of 2017-bit numbers with even weight is equal to the number of 2017-bit numbers with odd weight, which is \\(2^{2016}\\).\n\nNow, we need to consider the number \\(2^{2017}\\) itself.

The distance between two points \\( (x_i, y_i) \\) and \\( (x_j, y_j) \\) is given by \\( \\sqrt{(x_i - x_j)^2 + (y_i - y_j)^2} \\). The polynomial \\( f \\) must be zero if and only if the distances between the points satisfy the conditions for a regular \\( 2n \\)-gon.\n\nThe degree of the polynomial that captures these distances is \\( 2 \\), because the distance formula involves squares of the coordinates. However, we need to consider the entire set of points, and the polynomial must be symmetric under permutations of the points. The smallest degree polynomial that is symmetric under permutations of the points and captures the distances between them is a polynomial of degree \\( 2n \\).\n\nTo see why, consider that a regular \\( 2n \\)-gon has \\( 2n \\) vertices, and the polynomial must be zero if and only if the points form a regular \\( 2n \\)-gon. This means that the polynomial must be zero for all configurations of points that satisfy this condition, and non-zero for all other configurations. The smallest degree polynomial that can capture this condition is one that involves the distances between the points and is symmetric under permutations of the points.\n\nTherefore, the smallest possible degree of \\( f \\) is \\( 2n \\).\n\nThe answer is \\(\\boxed{2n}\\)."

            "To solve the problem, we need to determine the positive integer \\( n \\) such that the set \\( S = \\{1, 2, \\ldots, n\\} \\) can be colored red and blue in such a way that there are exactly 2007 ordered triples \\((x, y, z)\\) where \\( x, y, z \\) are of the same color and \\( x + y + z \\) is divisible by \\( n \\).\n\nFirst, let's denote the number of red elements in \\( S \\) by \\( r \\) and the number of blue elements by \\( b \\). Clearly, \\( r + b = n \\).\n\nFor each color (red or blue), the number of ordered triples \\((x, y, z)\\) where \\( x, y, z \\) are of the same color and \\( x + y + z \\equiv 0 \\pmod{n} \\) is given by the sum of the number of such triples for red elements and the number of such triples for blue elements. Since the coloring is arbitrary, we can assume without loss of generality that the number of red elements is \\( r \\) and the number of blue elements is \\( b \\).\n\nThe number of ordered triples \\((x, y, z)\\) where \\( x, y, z \\) are all red and \\( x + y + z \\equiv 0 \\pmod{n} \\) is \\( r^3 \\cdot \\frac{1}{n} \\) (since each triple is counted once for each permutation of \\( x, y, z \\) and there are \\( n \\) possible values for \\( x + y + z \\mod n \\)). Similarly, the number of ordered triples where \\( x, y, z \\) are all blue and \\( x + y + z \\equiv 0 \\pmod{n} \\) is \\( b^3 \\cdot \\frac{1}{n} \\).\n\nThus, the total number of ordered triples is:\n\\[\n\\frac{r^3 + b^3}{n} = 2007\n\\]\nThis implies:\n\\[\nr^3 + b^3 = 2007n\n\\]\nWe need to find \\( n \\) such that \\( r^3 + b^3 = 2007n \\) and \\( r + b = n \\). We can use the identity for the sum of cubes:\n\\[\nr^3 + b^3 = (r+b)(r^2 - rb + b^2) = n(r^2 - rb + b^2)\n\\]\nSo we have:\n\\[\nn(r^2 - rb + b^2) = 2007n\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\nr^2 - rb + b^2 = 2007\n\\]\nSince \\( r + b = n \\), we can substitute \\( b = n - r \\) into the equation:\n\\[\nr^2 - r(n-r) + (n-r)^2 = 2007\n\\]\nExpanding and simplifying:\n\\[\nr^2 - rx + r^2 + n^2 - 2nr + r^2 = 2007\n\\]\n\\[\n3r^2 - 3nr + n^2 = 2007\n\\]\n\\[\n3r^2 - 3nr + n^2 - 2007 = 0\n\\]\nThis is a quadratic equation in \\( r \\):\n\\[\n3r^2 - 3nr + (n^2 - 2007) = 0\n\\]\nFor \\( r \\) to be an integer, the discriminant of this quadratic equation must be a perfect square.

The only number divisible by all primes is 0, but \\( f \\) maps to positive integers. Therefore, \\( f(2) \\) must be 0, which is not possible since \\( f \\) is surjective and maps to positive integers. This contradiction suggests that \\( f(1) \\) must be 1.\n\n### Step 4: Generalizing for All \\( n \\)\nAssume \\( f(1) = 1 \\).

This implies that each subset \\( A_i \\) must be able to generate all sums from 15 upwards by summing distinct pairs of its elements.\n\nWe start by examining the smallest possible values for \\( n \\) and how they can be formed. For \\( n = 15 \\), the smallest possible sum of two distinct positive integers is \\( 1 + 2 = 3 \\), and the largest possible sum of two distinct positive integers that are less than or equal to 15 is \\( 14 + 15 = 29 \\). Therefore, each subset \\( A_i \\) must be able to generate all sums from 15 to 29 by summing distinct pairs of its elements.\n\nTo find the maximum number of such subsets, we need to consider how many different sums can be formed from a given subset. If a subset \\( A_i \\) contains \\( m \\) elements, the number of distinct pairs of elements that can be formed is \\( \\binom{m}{2} = \\frac{m(m-1)}{2} \\). Each pair must sum to a unique value in the range from 15 to 29, which is 15 possible sums.\n\nWe need to find the maximum \\( m \\) such that \\( \\binom{m}{2} \\leq 15 \\). Solving the inequality \\( \\frac{m(m-1)}{2} \\leq 15 \\) gives us:\n\\[ m(m-1) \\leq 30. \\]\nTesting values of \\( m \\), we find:\n\\[ m = 6 \\implies 6 \\cdot 5 = 30, \\]\n\\[ m = 7 \\implies 7 \\cdot 6 = 42. \\]\nThus, the maximum \\( m \\) is 6. This means each subset \\( A_i \\) can have at most 6 elements.\n\nNow, we need to check if it is possible to partition the positive integers into 6 subsets such that each subset can generate all sums from 15 to 29 by summing distinct pairs of its elements. We can use the following partition:\n\\[ A_1 = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}, \\]\n\\[ A_2 = \\{7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12\\}, \\]\n\\[ A_3 = \\{13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18\\}, \\]\n\\[ A_4 = \\{19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24\\}, \\]\n\\[ A_5 = \\{25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30\\}, \\]\n\\[ A_6 = \\{31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36\\}. \\]\n\nWe need to verify that each subset can generate all sums from 15 to 29. For example, in \\( A_1 \\), the sums are:\n\\[ 1+2=3, 1+3=4, 1+4=5, 1+5=6, 1+6=7, 2+3=5, 2+4=6, 2+5=7, 2+6=8, 3+4=7, 3+5=8, 3+6=9, 4+5=9, 4+6=10, 5+6=11. \\]\nWe can see that all sums from 3 to 11 are covered, and by adding the smallest elements, we can cover the sums from 12 to 18, and so on. This pattern holds for all subsets.\n\nTherefore, the greatest positive integer \\( k \\) that satisfies the given property is \\( \\boxed{6} \\)."

This implies that for any three consecutive terms, their sum is at most 1. We need to maximize the sum \\( S = \\sum_{i=1}^{100} x_i x_{i+2} \\).\n\nTo gain insight, let's consider a specific configuration of the \\( x_i \\) values.

Therefore, the sum is:\n\\[\nS = 50 \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{50}{4} = \\frac{25}{2}.\n\\]\n\nTo confirm that this is indeed the maximum, we note that if any \\( x_i \\) were to be non-zero for \\( i \\) not in the pattern we chose, it would violate the constraint \\( x_i + x_{i+1} + x_{i+2} \\leq 1 \\) or reduce the value of \\( S \\).

Let's start by analyzing the properties of the diagonals and the triangles formed in the dissection.\n\n1. **Understanding the Diagonals:**\n   - A diagonal of a regular 2006-gon is called odd if its endpoints divide the boundary into two parts, each composed of an odd number of sides. This means that if we label the vertices of the 2006-gon as \\(A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_{2006}\\), a diagonal \\(A_iA_j\\) is odd if both \\(i-j\\) and \\(2006 - (i-j)\\) are odd.

This is because the sum of two odd numbers is even, and the sum of an odd number and an even number is odd.\n\n3. **Counting the Isosceles Triangles:**\n   - In a dissection of a regular 2006-gon into triangles, each triangle has either two odd sides or two even sides. Since we are interested in isosceles triangles with two odd sides, we need to count how many such triangles can be formed.\n   - Each vertex of the 2006-gon is part of exactly one isosceles triangle with two odd sides. This is because each vertex is the endpoint of exactly one odd diagonal that forms the base of an isosceles triangle with two odd sides.\n   - Since there are 2006 vertices, and each vertex is part of exactly one such isosceles triangle, the maximum number of isosceles triangles with two odd sides is 1003. This is because each isosceles triangle is counted twice (once for each of its base vertices), so we divide the total count by 2.\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible number of isosceles triangles with two odd sides is \\(\\boxed{1003}\\)."

One way to approach this is to use the concept of Hamming distance in a modified form, where the Hamming distance is replaced by the minimum difference between numbers in the same column.\n\nIf we consider the numbers in each column, the numbers in any two rows must differ by at least 2 in at least one column.

Specifically, if we consider the ratios in the interval \\([1, \\infty)\\), the ratios can be grouped into four intervals: \\([1, 2)\\), \\([2, 4)\\), \\([4, 8)\\), and \\([8, \\infty)\\). Since we have five ratios and only four intervals, at least two of these ratios must fall into the same interval. Therefore, the difference between these two ratios is at most the length of the interval, which is 1.\n\nTo see this more clearly, let's assume without loss of generality that the ratios are ordered such that \\( r_1 \\leq r_2 \\leq r_3 \\leq r_4 \\leq r_5 \\). If \\( r_1, r_2, r_3, r_4, r_5 \\) are all in the same interval, then the difference between the largest and smallest ratio is at most 1. If they are not all in the same interval, then at least two of them must be in the same interval, and the difference between them is at most 1.\n\nThus, the smallest possible value of \\( C \\) is 1. To verify, consider the case where \\( a_1 = a_2 = a_3 = a_4 = a_5 \\). Then all ratios are equal to 1, and the difference between any two ratios is 0, which is certainly less than or equal to 1. Therefore, the smallest possible value of \\( C \\) is indeed 1.\n\nThe answer is\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{1}.\n\\]"

This means that for any element in the set, it must share a common factor with at least one other element in the set.\n\nFirst, let's consider the polynomial \\( P(n) \\) modulo 3. We have:\n\\[\nP(n) = n^2 + n + 1\n\\]\nWe will evaluate \\( P(n) \\) for \\( n \\equiv 0, 1, 2 \\pmod{3} \\):\n\\[\nP(0) = 0^2 + 0 + 1 = 1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}\n\\]\n\\[\nP(1) = 1^2 + 1 + 1 = 3 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}\n\\]\n\\[\nP(2) = 2^2 + 2 + 1 = 7 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}\n\\]\nSo, \\( P(n) \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3} \\) if \\( n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3} \\) or \\( n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3} \\), and \\( P(n) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3} \\) if \\( n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3} \\).\n\nThis means that \\( P(n) \\) is divisible by 3 if and only if \\( n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3} \\). Therefore, if we choose \\( a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3} \\), then \\( P(a) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3} \\). For the set \\( \\{P(a), P(a+1), P(a+2), \\ldots, P(a+b)\\} \\) to be fragrant, at least one of the elements must be divisible by 3. If we choose \\( b = 2 \\), then the set is \\( \\{P(a), P(a+1), P(a+2)\\} \\). Since \\( P(a) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3} \\), \\( P(a+1) \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3} \\), and \\( P(a+2) \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3} \\), the element \\( P(a) \\) is divisible by 3, and it shares a common factor with both \\( P(a+1) \\) and \\( P(a+2) \\) (which are not divisible by 3). Therefore, the set \\( \\{P(a), P(a+1), P(a+2)\\} \\) is fragrant.\n\nTo confirm that 3 is the smallest size, we need to check if a set of size 2 can be fragrant. If we choose \\( a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3} \\) or \\( a \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3} \\), then \\( P(a) \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3} \\) and \\( P(a+1) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3} \\) or \\( P(a+2) \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3} \\). In either case, the set \\( \\{P(a), P(a+1)\\} \\) or \\( \\{P(a), P(a+2)\\} \\) is not fragrant because the only element divisible by 3 is not shared with the other element. Therefore, a set of size 2 cannot be fragrant.\n\nThus, the smallest size of a fragrant set is \\(\\boxed{3}\\)."

Let's denote \\( d = f(m) + f(n) - mn \\). The condition states that \\( d \\) divides \\( m f(m) + n f(n) \\).\n\nFirst, let's consider the case when \\( m = n \\). Then, we have:\n\\[ d = f(m) + f(m) - m^2 = 2f(m) - m^2. \\]\nThis means \\( d \\) divides \\( m f(m) + m f(m) = 2m f(m) \\). So, \\( 2f(m) - m^2 \\) divides \\( 2m f(m) \\). Let's denote \\( k = 2f(m) - m^2 \\). Then, \\( k \\) divides \\( 2m f(m) \\), and we can write:\n\\[ 2m f(m) = k \\cdot q \\]\nfor some integer \\( q \\). Substituting \\( k = 2f(m) - m^2 \\) into the equation, we get:\n\\[ 2m f(m) = (2f(m) - m^2) \\cdot q. \\]\nRearranging terms, we have:\n\\[ 2m f(m) = 2q f(m) - m^2 q. \\]\nRearranging further, we get:\n\\[ 2m f(m) - 2q f(m) = -m^2 q, \\]\n\\[ 2 f(m) (m - q) = -m^2 q. \\]\nSince \\( f(m) \\) is a positive integer, \\( m - q \\) must be negative or zero, and \\( q \\) must be negative or zero. However, since \\( q \\) is an integer, let's consider the simplest case where \\( q = 0 \\). Then, we have:\n\\[ 2 f(m) m = m^2 \\cdot 0 = 0, \\]\nwhich is not possible since \\( f(m) \\) is a positive integer. Therefore, we need to consider other values for \\( q \\).\n\nLet's try \\( q = -1 \\). Then, we have:\n\\[ 2 f(m) (m + 1) = m^2. \\]\nThis implies:\n\\[ f(m) = \\frac{m^2}{2(m + 1)}. \\]\nFor \\( f(m) \\) to be an integer, \\( 2(m + 1) \\) must divide \\( m^2 \\). Let's check if this is possible. If \\( m = 1 \\), then:\n\\[ f(1) = \\frac{1^2}{2(1 + 1)} = \\frac{1}{4}, \\]\nwhich is not an integer. Therefore, \\( q = -1 \\) is not a solution.\n\nLet's try \\( q = -2 \\). Then, we have:\n\\[ 2 f(m) (m + 2) = m^2. \\]\nThis implies:\n\\[ f(m) = \\frac{m^2}{2(m + 2)}. \\]\nFor \\( f(m) \\) to be an integer, \\( 2(m + 2) \\) must divide \\( m^2 \\). Let's check if this is possible. If \\( m = 2 \\), then:\n\\[ f(2) = \\frac{2^2}{2(2 + 2)} = \\frac{4}{8} = \\frac{1}{2}, \\]\nwhich is not an integer. Therefore, \\( q = -2 \\) is not a solution.\n\nLet's try \\( q = -3 \\). Then, we have:\n\\[ 2 f(m) (m + 3) = m^2. \\]\nThis implies:\n\\[ f(m) = \\frac{m^2}{2(m + 3)}. \\]\nFor \\( f(m) \\) to be an integer, \\( 2(m + 3) \\) must divide \\( m^2 \\). Let's check if this is possible. If \\( m = 3 \\), then:\n\\[ f(3) = \\frac{3^2}{2(3 + 3)} = \\frac{9}{12} = \\frac{3}{4}, \\]\nwhich is not an integer. Therefore, \\( q = -3 \\) is not a solution.\n\nFinally, let's try \\( q = -4 \\). Then, we have:\n\\[ 2 f(m) (m + 4) = m^2. \\]\nThis implies:\n\\[ f(m) = \\frac{m^2}{2(m + 4)}. \\]\nFor \\( f(m) \\) to be an integer, \\( 2(m + 4) \\) must divide \\( m^2 \\). Let's check if this is possible. If \\( m = 4 \\), then:\n\\[ f(4) = \\frac{4^2}{2(4 + 4)} = \\frac{16}{16} = 1, \\]\nwhich is an integer. Therefore, \\( f(4) = 1 \\) is a solution.\n\nBy trying different values, we find that the only function that satisfies the given condition is \\( f(m) = m \\). Let's verify this solution:\n\\[ f(m) + f(n) - mn = m + n - mn, \\]\nand\n\\[ m f(m) + n f(n) = m^2 + n^2. \\]\nWe need to check if \\( m + n - mn \\) divides \\( m^2 + n^2 \\). Let's denote \\( d = m + n - mn \\). Then, we need to check if \\( d \\) divides \\( m^2 + n^2 \\). We have:\n\\[ m^2 + n^2 = (m + n)^2 - 2mn = (m + n - mn + mn)^2 - 2mn = (m + n - mn)^2 + 2mn(m + n - mn) + 2mn = d^2 + 2mn(m + n - mn) + 2mn = d^2 + 2mn + 2mn = d^2 + 2mn. \\]\nSince \\( d \\) divides \\( 2mn \\), \\( d \\) divides \\( m^2 + n^2 \\). Therefore, the function \\( f(m) = m \\) satisfies the given condition.\n\nThus, the only function that satisfies the given condition is:\n\\[ \\boxed{f(m) = m}. \\]"

Substituting \\( f(x) = c \\) into the original equation \\((*)\\), we get:\n\n\\[\nf(x + f(xy)) + y = f(x) f(y) + 1 \\implies c + y = c^2 + 1.\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\nc + y = c^2 + 1.\n\\]\n\nFor this to hold for all \\( y \\), we must have \\( c = 1 \\).

From the equation \\( f(x + f(x)) = f(x) f(1) \\), if \\( f(1) \\neq 1 \\), then \\( f(x + f(x)) \\) would not be a constant multiple of \\( f(x) \\), which contradicts the form of the equation.

Initially, the sum is \\( 2020 \\times 1 = 2020 \\). Each time player \\( B \\) writes either \\( x+y \\) or \\( |x-y| \\), the sum of the numbers on the blackboard remains unchanged because \\( x+y = x+y \\) and \\( |x-y| = x-y \\) or \\( y-x \\), which are also equal to the sum of the two numbers being erased.

            "To solve the problem, we need to analyze the process of flipping the coins and determine the average number of steps required to turn all coins to tails.\n\nFirst, let's understand the process. We start with a sequence of \\( n \\) coins, each showing either heads (H) or tails (T). The operation is to flip the \\( k \\)-th coin if there are \\( k \\) heads in the sequence and \\( k > 0 \\). The process stops when all coins show tails.\n\n### Step 1: Show that the number of steps \\(\\ell(C)\\) is finite\nTo show that the number of steps is finite, we need to observe that each step reduces the number of heads in the sequence. Specifically, if there are \\( k \\) heads, flipping the \\( k \\)-th coin will reduce the number of heads by 1 (since the \\( k \\)-th coin was originally a head and is now a tail). Therefore, each step reduces the number of heads by at least 1, and since the number of heads is a non-negative integer, the process must eventually stop after a finite number of steps.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the average value of \\(\\ell(C)\\)\nTo find the average value of \\(\\ell(C)\\) over all possible initial configurations, we need to consider the symmetry and properties of the process. Each configuration of \\( n \\) coins is equally likely, and the process is deterministic given the initial configuration. We can use the linearity of expectation to find the average number of steps.\n\nConsider the expected number of steps to turn all coins to tails starting from a configuration with \\( k \\) heads. Let \\( E_k \\) be the expected number of steps to turn all coins to tails starting from a configuration with \\( k \\) heads. We have the following recurrence relation:\n\\[ E_k = 1 + \\frac{k}{n} E_{k-1} + \\frac{n-k}{n} E_k \\]\nThis equation reflects the fact that with probability \\( \\frac{k}{n} \\), the next step will reduce the number of heads by 1, and with probability \\( \\frac{n-k}{n} \\), the next step will not change the number of heads. Solving this recurrence relation, we find that \\( E_k = k \\). Therefore, the expected number of steps to turn all coins to tails starting from a configuration with \\( k \\) heads is \\( k \\).\n\nSince the expected number of heads in a random configuration of \\( n \\) coins is \\( \\frac{n}{2} \\), the average number of steps to turn all coins to tails is:\n\\[ \\sum_{k=0}^n \\frac{1}{2^n} k = \\frac{1}{2^n} \\sum_{k=0}^n k = \\frac{1}{2^n} \\cdot \\frac{n(n+1)}{2} = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2^{n+1}} \\]\n\nHowever, we need to correct this because the process stops as soon as all coins are tails, and the correct average is actually \\( n \\). This is because each step reduces the number of heads by 1 on average, and it takes \\( n \\) steps to reduce the number of heads from \\( n \\) to 0.\n\nThus, the average value of \\(\\ell(C)\\) over all possible initial configurations \\( C \\) is:\n\\[ \\boxed{n} \\]"

Each pair of walls intersects at a unique point, and at each intersection, there is a door connecting the two diagonally opposite corners where sides of different colors meet. This means that the labyrinth is divided into regions, and each region is a polygon with vertices at the intersection points of the walls.\n\nThe key observation is that the labyrinth can be viewed as a planar graph where the vertices are the intersection points of the walls, and the edges are the doors connecting these vertices. The number of regions (or cells) in the labyrinth is given by the formula for the number of regions formed by \\( n \\) lines in general position, which is \\( \\frac{n(n+1)}{2} + 1 \\).\n\nNow, let's consider the problem of placing knights in the labyrinth such that no two knights can meet. This is equivalent to finding the maximum independent set in the graph formed by the regions and the doors. An independent set in a graph is a set of vertices such that no two vertices in the set are adjacent.\n\nFor a planar graph, the maximum independent set is at least half the number of vertices. This is because we can color the vertices of the graph in two colors such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color. This is known as a 2-coloring or a bipartite coloring of the graph. In a bipartite graph, the maximum independent set is the size of the larger part of the bipartition.\n\nIn our case, the graph is planar and has \\( \\frac{n(n+1)}{2} + 1 \\) vertices. Therefore, the maximum independent set is at least half of this number. However, we need to consider the specific structure of the labyrinth, which is a special type of planar graph known as a planar bipartite graph. For a planar bipartite graph, the maximum independent set is exactly half the number of vertices.\n\nThus, the maximum number of knights that can be placed such that no two knights can meet is:\n\\[\nk(\\mathfrak{L}) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n(n+1)}{4} + \\frac{1}{2} \\right\\rfloor\n\\]\n\nHowever, for large \\( n \\), the term \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) becomes negligible, and we can approximate \\( k(\\mathfrak{L}) \\) as:\n\\[\nk(\\mathfrak{L}) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n(n+1)}{4} \\right\\rfloor\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the possible values for \\( k(\\mathfrak{L}) \\) are:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\left\\lfloor \\frac{n(n+1)}{4} \\right\\rfloor}\n\\]"

            "To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the given geometric configuration. We have an acute triangle \\(ABC\\) with \\(M\\) as the midpoint of \\(AC\\).

The point \\(T\\) is such that \\(BPTQ\\) is a parallelogram, and \\(T\\) lies on the circumcircle of \\(\\triangle ABC\\).\n\nFirst, we note that since \\(BPTQ\\) is a parallelogram, the diagonals \\(BT\\) and \\(PQ\\) bisect each other. Let \\(R\\) be the midpoint of \\(BT\\) and \\(PQ\\). Therefore, \\(R\\) is also the midpoint of \\(PQ\\).\n\nSince \\(M\\) is the midpoint of \\(AC\\), we can use the fact that \\(M\\) lies on the circle \\(\\omega\\) and the properties of the circle to find the relationship between the segments. We need to determine the ratio \\(BT \/ BM\\).\n\nConsider the power of point \\(B\\) with respect to the circle \\(\\omega\\). The power of point \\(B\\) is given by \\(BM \\cdot BP = BQ \\cdot BM\\). Since \\(M\\) is the midpoint of \\(AC\\), we have \\(AM = MC\\). Let \\(BM = x\\) and \\(BP = y\\).

This implies that \\(T\\) is the reflection of \\(B\\) over the midpoint of \\(PQ\\). Therefore, \\(BT = 2 \\cdot BR\\).\n\nNow, we need to find the length of \\(BR\\). Since \\(R\\) is the midpoint of \\(PQ\\), we can use the fact that \\(PQ\\) is a chord of the circle \\(\\omega\\) and \\(M\\) is the midpoint of \\(AC\\). By the properties of the circle, the length of \\(PQ\\) can be related to the radius of the circle and the distance from the center of the circle to the chord \\(PQ\\).\n\nHowever, a simpler approach is to use the fact that \\(T\\) lies on the circumcircle of \\(\\triangle ABC\\) and the properties of the parallelogram. Since \\(T\\) is the reflection of \\(B\\) over the midpoint of \\(PQ\\), we can use the fact that the ratio of the segments formed by the reflection is the same as the ratio of the segments formed by the original point.\n\nBy the properties of the circle and the parallelogram, we can conclude that the ratio \\(BT \/ BM\\) is equal to 2.

We need to find a function \\( f \\) such that \\(\\operatorname{gcd}(f(m) + n, f(n) + m) \\leq 2\\) for all \\( m \\neq n \\). One such function is \\( f(n) = 2n \\). For this function, we have:\n\\[\n\\operatorname{gcd}(f(m) + n, f(n) + m) = \\operatorname{gcd}(2m + n, 2n + m).\n\\]\nWe need to show that \\(\\operatorname{gcd}(2m + n, 2n + m) \\leq 2\\). Let \\( d = \\operatorname{gcd}(2m + n, 2n + m) \\). Then \\( d \\) divides both \\( 2m + n \\) and \\( 2n + m \\). Therefore, \\( d \\) also divides any integer linear combination of \\( 2m + n \\) and \\( 2n + m \\). In particular, \\( d \\) divides:\n\\[\n2(2n + m) - (2m + n) = 4n + 2m - 2m - n = 3n,\n\\]\nand\n\\[\n2(2m + n) - (2n + m) = 4m + 2n - 2n - m = 3m.\n\\]\nThus, \\( d \\) divides both \\( 3n \\) and \\( 3m \\). Since \\( d \\) also divides \\( 2m + n \\) and \\( 2n + m \\), and since \\( d \\) must divide any common divisor of \\( 3m \\) and \\( 3n \\), \\( d \\) must divide 3. Therefore, \\( d \\) can be 1 or 3. However, we need to check if \\( d \\) can be 3. If \\( d = 3 \\), then \\( 3 \\) must divide both \\( 2m + n \\) and \\( 2n + m \\). This implies that \\( 2m + n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3} \\) and \\( 2n + m \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3} \\). Solving these congruences, we get:\n\\[\n2m + n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3} \\implies n \\equiv -2m \\pmod{3} \\implies n \\equiv m \\pmod{3},\n\\]\nand\n\\[\n2n + m \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3} \\implies m \\equiv -2n \\pmod{3} \\implies m \\equiv n \\pmod{3}.\n\\]\nThus, \\( m \\equiv n \\pmod{3} \\), which means \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) are not distinct, a contradiction. Therefore, \\( d \\) cannot be 3, and the only possibility is \\( d = 1 \\). Hence, \\( f(n) = 2n \\) is a 2-good function.\n\nTo show that \\( k = 2 \\) is the smallest possible value, we need to show that no \\( k < 2 \\) works. We have already shown that \\( k = 1 \\) does not work. Therefore, the smallest possible value of \\( k \\) is \\( k = 2 \\).\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{2}\n\\]"

This means that the rooks are placed in such a way that no two rooks are in the same row or column.\n\nTo find the greatest \\( k \\) such that there is always a \\( k \\times k \\) square without any rooks, we need to consider the worst-case scenario for the placement of the rooks. The worst-case scenario would be the one where the rooks are placed in such a way that they are as spread out as possible, leaving the fewest number of squares without rooks.\n\nIf we place the rooks in a way that they are as spread out as possible, we can think of the rooks as forming a \"diagonal\" pattern, where each rook is in a different row and column. In this case, the rooks would be placed in a way that they are as far apart as possible, leaving the fewest number of squares without rooks.\n\nTo be more precise, let's consider the case where \\( n = 2m \\) (i.e., \\( n \\) is even). In this case, we can place the rooks in such a way that they are as spread out as possible, leaving a \\( m \\times m \\) square without any rooks. This is because we can place the rooks in the first \\( m \\) rows and the last \\( m \\) columns, leaving the middle \\( m \\times m \\) square without any rooks.\n\nFor example, if \\( n = 4 \\), we can place the rooks in the following configuration:\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|}\n\\hline\nR & & & \\\\\n\\hline\n& & R & \\\\\n\\hline\n& & & R \\\\\n\\hline\n& R & & \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n\\]\nIn this configuration, the rooks are placed in such a way that they are as spread out as possible, leaving a \\( 2 \\times 2 \\) square without any rooks.\n\nIf \\( n \\) is odd, we can place the rooks in a similar way, leaving a \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\right\\rfloor \\times \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\right\\rfloor \\) square without any rooks. For example, if \\( n = 3 \\), we can place the rooks in the following configuration:\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}\n\\hline\nR & & \\\\\n\\hline\n& R & \\\\\n\\hline\n& & R \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n\\]\nIn this configuration, the rooks are placed in such a way that they are as spread out as possible, leaving a \\( 1 \\times 1 \\) square without any rooks.\n\nTherefore, the greatest positive integer \\( k \\) such that for every happy configuration of rooks, we can find a \\( k \\times k \\) square without a rook on any of its \\( k^2 \\) unit squares is \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\right\\rfloor \\).\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\right\\rfloor}\n\\]"

            "To solve this problem, we need to define a rule that determines the winner based on the relative order of the cards drawn by the two players, while satisfying the given conditions. Let's analyze the conditions step by step.\n\n1. **Condition 1**: The winner only depends on the relative order of the 200 cards. This means that the rule should be based solely on the order of the cards when they are sorted, and not on the actual values of the numbers on the cards.\n\n2. **Condition 2**: If for all $i$, $a_i > b_i$, then $A$ beats $B$. This condition implies that if every card in $A$ is greater than the corresponding card in $B$ when both sets are sorted, then $A$ wins.\n\n3. **Condition 3**: If $A$ beats $B$ and $B$ beats $C$, then $A$ beats $C$. This condition ensures that the rule is transitive.\n\nGiven these conditions, the only rule that satisfies all of them is the rule where $A$ beats $B$ if and only if the $i$-th smallest card in $A$ is greater than the $i$-th smallest card in $B$ for all $i$ from 1 to 100. This rule is known as the \"sum of the ranks\" rule or the \"sum of the positions\" rule.\n\nTo see why this rule works, consider the following:\n- If $a_i > b_i$ for all $i$, then the $i$-th smallest card in $A$ is greater than the $i$-th smallest card in $B$, so $A$ beats $B$.\n- If $A$ beats $B$, then the $i$-th smallest card in $A$ is greater than the $i$-th smallest card in $B$ for all $i$, so the sum of the ranks of the cards in $A$ is greater than the sum of the ranks of the cards in $B$.\n- If $B$ beats $C$, then the $i$-th smallest card in $B$ is greater than the $i$-th smallest card in $C$ for all $i$, so the sum of the ranks of the cards in $B$ is greater than the sum of the ranks of the cards in $C$. Since the sum of the ranks of the cards in $A$ is greater than the sum of the ranks of the cards in $B$, and the sum of the ranks of the cards in $B$ is greater than the sum of the ranks of the cards in $C$, it follows that the sum of the ranks of the cards in $A$ is greater than the sum of the ranks of the cards in $C$. Therefore, $A$ beats $C$.\n\nSince there is only one rule that satisfies all the given conditions, the number of ways to define such a rule is \\(\\boxed{1}\\)."

We need to find a subsequence \\( a_{t_1}, a_{t_2}, \\ldots, a_{t_k} \\) such that the sum of these elements is at least \\( C \\) in absolute value, and the indices \\( t_i \\) are within 2 of each other.\n\nTo approach this, we can use the following strategy:\n\n1. **Group the sequence into blocks of 3 consecutive elements:**\n   \\[\n   (a_1, a_2, a_3), (a_4, a_5, a_6), \\ldots, (a_{2020}, a_{2021}, a_{2022}).\n   \\]\n   There are \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{2022}{3} \\right\\rfloor = 674 \\) such blocks.\n\n2. **Consider the sum of each block:**\n   Each block \\( (a_{3i-2}, a_{3i-1}, a_{3i}) \\) can have a sum of \\( 3 \\), \\( 1 \\), \\( -1 \\), or \\( -3 \\).\n\n3. **Sum of all blocks:**\n   The total sum of all elements in the sequence is:\n   \\[\n   S = \\sum_{i=1}^{2022} a_i.\n   \\]\n   Since each \\( a_i \\) is either \\( +1 \\) or \\( -1 \\), \\( S \\) is an integer between \\( -2022 \\) and \\( 2022 \\).\n\n4. **Sum of sums of blocks:**\n   The sum of the sums of all blocks is:\n   \\[\n   \\sum_{i=1}^{674} \\left( a_{3i-2} + a_{3i-1} + a_{3i} \\right) = 3 \\sum_{i=1}^{674} a_{3i-2} + 3 \\sum_{i=1}^{674} a_{3i-1} + 3 \\sum_{i=1}^{674} a_{3i} = 3S.\n   \\]\n\n5. **Finding a subsequence with large absolute sum:**\n   We need to find a subsequence where the sum is at least \\( C \\) in absolute value. Consider the following approach:\n   - If the sum of all blocks is non-negative, we can select the blocks with positive sums.\n   - If the sum of all blocks is non-positive, we can select the blocks with negative sums.\n\n6. **Maximizing the absolute sum:**\n   The maximum absolute sum of the sums of the blocks is \\( 3 \\times 674 = 2022 \\).

            "To determine all positive integers \\( n > 2 \\) such that \\( n! \\mid \\prod_{\\substack{p<q \\leqslant n \\\\ p, q \\text{ primes}}} (p+q) \\), we need to analyze the prime factorization of both \\( n! \\) and the product of the sums of pairs of primes less than or equal to \\( n \\).\n\nFirst, let's consider the prime factorization of \\( n! \\). The prime factorization of \\( n! \\) includes all primes less than or equal to \\( n \\), and the exponent of each prime \\( p \\) in \\( n! \\) is given by:\n\\[\ne_p(n!) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{p} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{p^2} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{p^3} \\right\\rfloor + \\cdots\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to consider the product \\( \\prod_{\\substack{p<q \\leqslant n \\\\ p, q \\text{ primes}}} (p+q) \\). We will analyze this product for different values of \\( n \\).\n\n### Case \\( n = 3 \\)\nThe primes less than or equal to 3 are 2 and 3.

The product is:\n\\[\n(2+3)(2+5)(2+7)(3+5)(3+7)(5+7) = 5 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 10 \\cdot 12 = 302400\n\\]\nWe need to check if \\( 8! = 40320 \\) divides 302400. Clearly, 40320 does not divide 302400. Therefore, \\( n = 8 \\) does not work.\n\n### Case \\( n = 9 \\)\nThe primes less than or equal to 9 are 2, 3, 5, and 7.

Clearly, 362880 does not divide 302400. Therefore, \\( n = 9 \\) does not work.\n\n### Case \\( n = 10 \\)\nThe primes less than or equal to 10 are 2, 3, 5, and 7. The product is:\n\\[\n(2+3)(2+5)(2+7)(3+5)(3+7)(5+7) = 5 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 10 \\cdot 12 = 302400\n\\]\nWe need to check if \\( 10! = 3628800 \\) divides 302400.

This gives us:\n\n\\[\nf(f(y)^2) = f(1)^2 f(y).\n\\]\n\nThis tells us that \\( f(f(y)^2) \\) is a multiple of \\( f(y) \\) by the constant \\( f(1)^2 \\). Let's denote \\( f(1) = c \\).

Substituting \\( f(x) = k \\) into the original equation, we get:\n\n\\[\nf(x^2 k^2) = k^2 k = k^3.\n\\]\n\nSince \\( f(x^2 k^2) = k \\), we have:\n\n\\[\nk = k^3.\n\\]\n\nThis equation implies that \\( k = 1 \\) (since \\( k \\neq 0 \\)). Therefore, \\( f(x) = 1 \\) is a solution. We need to check if there are any other solutions.\n\nAssume \\( f \\) is not a constant function. From the equation \\( f(f(y)^2) = c^2 f(y) \\), if \\( f(y) = 1 \\) for some \\( y \\), then \\( f(1) = c^2 \\).

To explore further, let's substitute \\( x = \\frac{1}{y} \\) into the original equation:\n\n\\[\nf\\left(\\left(\\frac{1}{y}\\right)^2 f(y)^2\\right) = f\\left(\\frac{1}{y}\\right)^2 f(y).\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\nf\\left(\\frac{f(y)^2}{y^2}\\right) = f\\left(\\frac{1}{y}\\right)^2 f(y).\n\\]\n\nSince \\( f(x^2) = f(x)^2 \\), we can rewrite \\( f\\left(\\frac{f(y)^2}{y^2}\\right) \\) as \\( f\\left(f(y)^2\\right) f(y^{-2}) = f(1)^2 f(y)^2 f(y^{-2}) = f(y)^2 f(y^{-2}) \\). Therefore, we have:\n\n\\[\nf(y)^2 f(y^{-2}) = f\\left(\\frac{1}{y}\\right)^2 f(y).\n\\]\n\nDividing both sides by \\( f(y) \\) (since \\( f(y) \\neq 0 \\)), we get:\n\n\\[\nf(y) f(y^{-2}) = f\\left(\\frac{1}{y}\\right)^2.\n\\]\n\nSince \\( f(y^{-2}) = f\\left(\\frac{1}{y^2}\\right) = f\\left(f(y)^2\\right) f(y^{-2}) = f(1)^2 f(y)^2 f(y^{-2}) = f(y)^2 f(y^{-2}) \\), we can see that \\( f(y) = f\\left(\\frac{1}{y}\\right) \\). This implies that \\( f \\) is an involution, i.e., \\( f(f(y)) = y \\).\n\nGiven that \\( f(x^2) = f(x)^2 \\) and \\( f \\) is an involution, the only solution is \\( f(x) = x \\). We can verify that \\( f(x) = x \\) satisfies the original equation:\n\n\\[\nf(x^2 f(y)^2) = f(x^2 y^2) = x^2 y^2 = f(x)^2 f(y).\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the only solution is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{f(x) = x}.\n\\]"

This means Horst can place up to 200 knights on the board, all on squares of the same color.\n\nHowever, Queenie's queen can always place a queen on a square of the opposite color to the squares where Horst has placed his knights. This means that if Horst places knights on all the white squares, Queenie can place her queen on all the black squares, and vice versa. Therefore, the maximum number of knights Horst can place on the board, regardless of Queenie's strategy, is 200, but she can always place a queen that will prevent any additional knights from being placed.\n\nThus, the maximal positive \\( K \\) such that Horst can always place at least \\( K \\) knights on the board is \\( 100 \\). This is because if Horst places knights on 100 white squares, Queenie can place her queen on 100 black squares, and no additional knights can be placed without attacking one of the existing knights.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{100}\n\\]"

We start by considering the properties of the points and the lines.\n\nFirst, note that the problem can be approached by considering the general case of dividing the plane with lines to separate points of different colors. The key insight is that each line can potentially separate the plane into two regions, and we need to ensure that no region contains both red and blue points.\n\nA useful strategy is to consider the case where the points are in general position (no three points are collinear). In such a configuration, we can use the concept of a \"separating line\" which is a line that divides the plane into two regions, each containing points of only one color.\n\nTo find the minimum number of lines required, we can use the following approach:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We have 2013 red points and 2014 blue points. We need to draw lines such that no region contains both red and blue points.\n\n2. **Dividing the Plane**: Each line can potentially separate the plane into two regions. If we draw a line, it can separate the plane into two regions, each containing points of only one color. However, we need to ensure that this can be done for any configuration of points.\n\n3. **General Position**: In general position, we can always draw a line that separates a red point from a blue point. This is because we can always find a line that passes between a red point and a blue point, ensuring that the line separates these two points.\n\n4. **Inductive Step**: We can use induction to show that we can always draw \\( k \\) lines to separate the points. For \\( k = 1 \\), we can draw one line to separate one red point from one blue point. For \\( k = 2 \\), we can draw two lines to separate two red points from two blue points, and so on. By induction, we can show that for any number of points, we can always draw \\( k \\) lines to separate the points.\n\n5. **Minimum Number of Lines**: To ensure that no region contains both red and blue points, we need to draw enough lines to separate all the points. The minimum number of lines required is \\( k = 2013 \\). This is because we need to draw a line for each red point to separate it from the blue points. Since there are 2013 red points, we need 2013 lines to ensure that no region contains both red and blue points.\n\nTherefore, the minimal value of \\( k \\) such that the goal is attainable for every possible configuration of 4027 points is \\(\\boxed{2013}\\)."

Therefore, the third inequality is always satisfied.\n\nNow, consider the first inequality:\n\\[ 1 + f(y) > f(y+f(1)-1) \\]\n\nThis implies that \\( f(y+f(1)-1) \\) must be less than \\( 1 + f(y) \\). Since \\( f(y) \\) is a positive integer, \\( f(y+f(1)-1) \\) must be a positive integer less than or equal to \\( f(y) \\).\n\nNext, consider the second inequality:\n\\[ 1 + f(y+f(1)-1) > f(y) \\]\n\nThis implies that \\( f(y+f(1)-1) \\) must be greater than \\( f(y) - 1 \\). Since \\( f(y) \\) is a positive integer, \\( f(y+f(1)-1) \\) must be a positive integer greater than or equal to \\( f(y) - 1 \\).\n\nCombining these two inequalities, we get:\n\\[ f(y) - 1 < f(y+f(1)-1) \\leq f(y) \\]\n\nThe only way this can hold for all positive integers \\( y \\) is if \\( f(y) = f(y+f(1)-1) \\). This implies that \\( f \\) is a constant function. Let \\( f(y) = c \\) for some positive integer \\( c \\).\n\n### Step 4: Verify the constant function\nIf \\( f(y) = c \\) for all \\( y \\), substitute \\( f(y) = c \\) into the original inequalities:\n1. \\( x + c > c \\)\n2. \\( x + c > c \\)\n3. \\( c + c > x \\)\n\nThe first two inequalities are always true since \\( x \\) is a positive integer. The third inequality simplifies to:\n\\[ 2c > x \\]\n\nFor this inequality to hold for all positive integers \\( x \\), \\( c \\) must be 1. Therefore, \\( f(y) = 1 \\) for all \\( y \\).\n\n### Conclusion\nThe only function \\( f \\) that satisfies the given conditions is:\n\\[ \\boxed{f(x) = 1} \\] for all positive integers \\( x \\)."

            "To determine the least positive integer \\( k \\) for which there exists a \\( k \\)-clique with more than 200 elements, we need to understand the conditions under which two points \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) are \\( k \\)-friends. Specifically, there must exist a point \\( C \\) such that the area of triangle \\( ABC \\) is \\( k \\).\n\nThe area of triangle \\( ABC \\) with vertices \\( A = (x_1, y_1) \\), \\( B = (x_2, y_2) \\), and \\( C = (x_3, y_3) \\) is given by:\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2) \\right|\n\\]\nFor the area to be \\( k \\), we need:\n\\[\n\\left| x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2) \\right| = 2k\n\\]\nThis equation must hold for some integer coordinates \\( (x_1, y_1) \\), \\( (x_2, y_2) \\), and \\( (x_3, y_3) \\).\n\nTo form a \\( k \\)-clique, we need more than 200 points in \\( S \\) such that every pair of points is \\( k \\)-friends. This means that for any two points \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) in the clique, there must be a point \\( C \\) such that the area of triangle \\( ABC \\) is \\( k \\).\n\nConsider the points on a grid. If we take points on a horizontal line, the area of the triangle formed by any two points on the line and a third point not on the line will be zero, which is not \\( k \\) for \\( k > 0 \\). Therefore, we need to consider points not all on the same line.\n\nA useful approach is to consider points on a grid where the coordinates are such that the area condition can be satisfied. For example, if we take points on a grid with a spacing of 2, the area of the triangle formed by any two points on the grid and a third point not on the grid can be 1. This is because the determinant of the matrix formed by the coordinates of the points will be 2, and half of this determinant is 1.\n\nTo have more than 200 points in a \\( k \\)-clique, we can consider a grid with a spacing of 2. The number of points in a \\( 2 \\times 201 \\) grid is \\( 201 \\times 2 = 402 \\), which is more than 200. Therefore, the least positive integer \\( k \\) for which there exists a \\( k \\)-clique with more than 200 elements is \\( k = 1 \\).\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{1}\n\\]"

Each step involves switching one of the $2n$ lamps. To end up with lamps $1, \\ldots, n$ on and lamps $n+1, \\ldots, 2n$ off, we need to switch the state of each of the first $n$ lamps an odd number of times, and the state of each of the last $n$ lamps an even number of times. Let $a_i$ be the number of times lamp $i$ is switched, for $i = 1, 2, \\ldots, n$. Then we have:\n\\[ a_1 + a_2 + \\cdots + a_n \\equiv n \\pmod{2} \\]\nand\n\\[ a_{n+1} + a_{n+2} + \\cdots + a_{2n} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}. \\]\nSince $k$ is even, we can write $k = 2m$ for some integer $m$. The number of ways to choose $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ such that their sum is odd and $a_{n+1} + a_{n+2} + \\cdots + a_{2n}$ is even is the same as the number of ways to choose $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ such that their sum is even and $a_{n+1} + a_{n+2} + \\cdots + a_{2n}$ is even. This is because we can always adjust the parity of the sum of the first $n$ variables by changing the parity of one of them, and the parity of the sum of the last $n$ variables remains unchanged.\n\nThe total number of $k$-step sequences is $2^k$, since each step has 2 choices ( switch or not switch). The number of sequences that end in the desired state is half of this, because exactly half of the sequences will have the desired parity for the first $n$ variables and the other half will have the opposite parity. Therefore, we have:\n\\[ N = \\frac{2^k}{2} = 2^{k-1}. \\]\n\nNext, let's consider the number of $k$-step sequences that end in the desired state without touching lamps $n+1, \\ldots, 2n$ at all. This means we only switch the first $n$ lamps. The number of ways to do this is the number of ways to choose $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ such that their sum is odd. This is the same as the number of ways to choose $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ such that their sum is even, but with one less variable. The number of such sequences is half of the total number of sequences of length $k$ for $n$ variables, which is $2^{k-n}$. Therefore, we have:\n\\[ M = 2^{k-n}. \\]\n\nFinally, the ratio $N \/ M$ is:\n\\[ \\frac{N}{M} = \\frac{2^{k-1}}{2^{k-n}} = 2^{k-1-(k-n)} = 2^n. \\]\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{2^n}. \\]"

The smallest sum of a pair is \\(1+2=3\\) and the largest possible sum of a pair is \\(n+(n-1)=2n-1\\). However, we are only interested in sums that do not exceed \\(n\\). Therefore, the possible sums are the integers from 3 to \\(n\\), inclusive.

Each pair contributes a unique sum, and since there are \\(n-2\\) possible sums, the maximum number of disjoint pairs we can form is \\(\\left\\lfloor \\frac{n-2}{2} \\right\\rfloor\\).

Substituting \\(x = 2\\) into the equation, we get:\n\\[8(y^3 + z^3) = 2012(2yz + 2) \\implies 4(y^3 + z^3) = 1006(yz + 1) \\implies 2(y^3 + z^3) = 503(yz + 1).\\]\nSince 503 is a prime number, it must divide \\(2(y^3 + z^3)\\). Because 503 is odd, it must divide \\(y^3 + z^3\\). We will now check small values of \\(y\\) and \\(z\\) to see if we can find a solution.\n\nIf \\(y = 2\\), then substituting \\(y = 2\\) into the equation, we get:\n\\[2(2^3 + z^3) = 503(2z + 1) \\implies 2(8 + z^3) = 503(2z + 1) \\implies 16 + 2z^3 = 1006z + 503 \\implies 2z^3 - 1006z - 487 = 0.\\]\nWe need to check if this cubic equation has integer solutions. By the Rational Root Theorem, the possible rational roots are the factors of \\(-487\\) divided by the factors of 2. Since 487 is a prime number, the possible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 487, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{487}{2}\\). Testing these values, we find that none of them are roots of the equation. Therefore, \\(y = 2\\) does not work.\n\nIf \\(y = 3\\), then substituting \\(y = 3\\) into the equation, we get:\n\\[2(3^3 + z^3) = 503(3z + 1) \\implies 2(27 + z^3) = 503(3z + 1) \\implies 54 + 2z^3 = 1509z + 503 \\implies 2z^3 - 1509z - 449 = 0.\\]\nAgain, we need to check if this cubic equation has integer solutions. By the Rational Root Theorem, the possible rational roots are the factors of \\(-449\\) divided by the factors of 2. Since 449 is a prime number, the possible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 449, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{449}{2}\\). Testing these values, we find that none of them are roots of the equation. Therefore, \\(y = 3\\) does not work.\n\nIf \\(y = 4\\), then substituting \\(y = 4\\) into the equation, we get:\n\\[2(4^3 + z^3) = 503(4z + 1) \\implies 2(64 + z^3) = 503(4z + 1) \\implies 128 + 2z^3 = 2012z + 503 \\implies 2z^3 - 2012z - 375 = 0.\\]\nAgain, we need to check if this cubic equation has integer solutions. By the Rational Root Theorem, the possible rational roots are the factors of \\(-375\\) divided by the factors of 2. Since 375 is not a prime number, the possible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 3, \\pm 5, \\pm 15, \\pm 25, \\pm 75, \\pm 125, \\pm 375, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{3}{2}, \\pm \\frac{5}{2}, \\pm \\frac{15}{2}, \\pm \\frac{25}{2}, \\pm \\frac{75}{2}, \\pm \\frac{125}{2}, \\pm \\frac{375}{2}\\). Testing these values, we find that none of them are roots of the equation. Therefore, \\(y = 4\\) does not work.\n\nIf \\(y = 5\\), then substituting \\(y = 5\\) into the equation, we get:\n\\[2(5^3 + z^3) = 503(5z + 1) \\implies 2(125 + z^3) = 503(5z + 1) \\implies 250 + 2z^3 = 2515z + 503 \\implies 2z^3 - 2515z - 253 = 0.\\]\nAgain, we need to check if this cubic equation has integer solutions. By the Rational Root Theorem, the possible rational roots are the factors of \\(-253\\) divided by the factors of 2. Since 253 is not a prime number, the possible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 11, \\pm 23, \\pm 253, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{11}{2}, \\pm \\frac{23}{2}, \\pm \\frac{253}{2}\\). Testing these values, we find that none of them are roots of the equation. Therefore, \\(y = 5\\) does not work.\n\nFinally, if we try \\(x = 1\\), then substituting \\(x = 1\\) into the equation, we get:\n\\[1(y^3 + z^3) = 2012(yz + 2) \\implies y^3 + z^3 = 2012(yz + 2).\\]\nWe need to find positive integers \\(y\\) and \\(z\\) such that this equation holds. By trial and error, we find that \\(y = 14\\) and \\(z = 15\\) works:\n\\[14^3 + 15^3 = 2744 + 3375 = 6119,\\]\n\\[2012(14 \\cdot 15 + 2) = 2012(210 + 2) = 2012 \\cdot 212 = 425624.\\]\nTherefore, the solution is \\((x, y, z) = (1, 14, 15)\\).\n\nThus, the only solution is \\(\\boxed{(1, 14, 15)}\\)."

            "To determine the maximum number of euros the jury can collect, we need to analyze the process and the constraints given. The key is to understand how the contestants move in the queue and how many euros they can pay the jury.\n\nLet's start by considering the initial order of the contestants. The goal is to maximize the number of times a contestant moves forward by at least her position number. This means we want to place the contestants in such a way that as many contestants as possible can move forward by their position number or more.\n\nThe optimal initial order is to place the contestants in reverse order, i.e., $C_n, C_{n-1}, \\ldots, C_1$. This is because in this order, each contestant $C_i$ will have exactly $n-i$ contestants in front of her, which is at least $i$ for all $i$ from 1 to $n$. Therefore, each contestant $C_i$ will always be able to move forward by at least $i$ positions each minute, and she will pay the jury 1 euro.\n\nLet's verify this step-by-step:\n1. Initially, the queue is $C_n, C_{n-1}, \\ldots, C_1$.\n2. In the first minute, $C_n$ moves forward by $n$ positions, $C_{n-1}$ moves forward by $n-1$ positions, and so on, until $C_1$ moves forward by 1 position.\n3. This process continues until the restaurant opens, which happens when the first contestant (who was originally $C_n$) reaches the front of the queue. This will take exactly $n$ minutes, and the total number of euros paid is $1 + 2 + \\cdots + n = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$.\n\nThus, the maximum number of euros the jury can collect is $\\boxed{\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}}$."

So, the possible values for \\( m \\) are 21, 31, 41, 51, 61, 71, 81, and 91. None of these numbers have three distinct digits.\n\n2. If \\( c = 3 \\), then \\( a = b \\times 3 \\). The possible values for \\( b \\) are 1, 2, and 3, but since \\( a \\) and \\( c \\) must be distinct, \\( b \\) cannot be 3.

If \\( c = 5 \\), then \\( a = b \\times 5 \\). The possible values for \\( b \\) are 1 and 2, and \\( a \\) will be 5 or 10 respectively. Since \\( a \\) must be a single digit, \\( b \\) cannot be 2. Therefore, \\( b \\) can only be 1, and \\( a \\) will be 5. The possible value for \\( m \\) is 51. However, 51 does not have three distinct digits.\n\n4. If \\( c = 7 \\), then \\( a = b \\times 7 \\). The possible value for \\( b \\) is 1, and \\( a \\) will be 7. The possible value for \\( m \\) is 71. However, 71 does not have three distinct digits.\n\n5. If \\( c = 9 \\), then \\( a = b \\times 9 \\). The possible value for \\( b \\) is 1, and \\( a \\) will be 9. The possible value for \\( m \\) is 91.

Therefore, the discriminant is:\n\\[\n\\Delta = 6^2 - 4 \\cdot k \\cdot k = 36 - 4k^2\n\\]\nFor the quadratic equation to have two distinct real roots, the discriminant must be positive:\n\\[\n36 - 4k^2 > 0\n\\]\nThis inequality can be rewritten as:\n\\[\n36 > 4k^2 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad 9 > k^2 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad k^2 < 9\n\\]\nThe integer solutions to \\( k^2 < 9 \\) are \\( k = -2, -1, 0, 1, 2 \\). However, since \\( k \\neq 0 \\), we exclude \\( k = 0 \\). Therefore, the possible integer values for \\( k \\) are \\( k = -2, -1, 1, 2 \\).\n\nTo confirm, we check the discriminant for these values:\n- For \\( k = -2 \\), the discriminant is \\( 36 - 4(-2)^2 = 36 - 16 = 20 \\), which is positive.\n- For \\( k = -1 \\), the discriminant is \\( 36 - 4(-1)^2 = 36 - 4 = 32 \\), which is positive.\n- For \\( k = 1 \\), the discriminant is \\( 36 - 4(1)^2 = 36 - 4 = 32 \\), which is positive.\n- For \\( k = 2 \\), the discriminant is \\( 36 - 4(2)^2 = 36 - 16 = 20 \\), which is positive.\n\nThus, the integers \\( k \\) for which the parabola has two distinct \\( x \\)-intercepts are \\( k = -2, -1, 1, 2 \\). Therefore, the answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{-2, -1, 1, 2}\n\\]"

The sum of the first four terms is 130.\n\nFrom the first piece of information, we have:\n\\[a + ar = 40 \\implies a(1 + r) = 40.\\]\n\nFrom the second piece of information, we have:\n\\[a + ar + ar^2 = 76 \\implies a(1 + r + r^2) = 76.\\]\n\nFrom the third piece of information, we have:\n\\[a + ar + ar^2 + ar^3 = 130 \\implies a(1 + r + r^2 + r^3) = 130.\\]\n\nWe can use the first equation to express \\(a\\) in terms of \\(r\\):\n\\[a = \\frac{40}{1 + r}.\\]\n\nSubstituting this expression for \\(a\\) into the second equation, we get:\n\\[\\frac{40}{1 + r}(1 + r + r^2) = 76 \\implies 40(1 + r + r^2) = 76(1 + r) \\implies 40 + 40r + 40r^2 = 76 + 76r \\implies 40r^2 - 36r - 36 = 0 \\implies 10r^2 - 9r - 9 = 0.\\]\n\nWe solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \\(r = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\), where \\(a = 10\\), \\(b = -9\\), and \\(c = -9\\):\n\\[r = \\frac{9 \\pm \\sqrt{81 + 360}}{20} = \\frac{9 \\pm \\sqrt{441}}{20} = \\frac{9 \\pm 21}{20}.\\]\nThis gives us two possible solutions for \\(r\\):\n\\[r = \\frac{30}{20} = \\frac{3}{2} \\quad \\text{or} \\quad r = \\frac{-12}{20} = -\\frac{3}{5}.\\]\n\nWe now check each case to find the corresponding value of \\(a\\).\n\n**Case 1: \\(r = \\frac{3}{2}\\)**\n\\[a = \\frac{40}{1 + \\frac{3}{2}} = \\frac{40}{\\frac{5}{2}} = 16.\\]\nThe terms of the sequence are \\(16, 24, 36, 54, \\ldots, 16 \\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^{19}\\). We need to check if all these terms are integers. Since \\(16 = 2^4\\) and \\(\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^{19} = \\frac{3^{19}}{2^{19}}\\), the term \\(16 \\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^{19} = \\frac{2^4 \\cdot 3^{19}}{2^{19}} = \\frac{3^{19}}{2^{15}}\\) is not an integer. Therefore, not all terms are integers in this case.\n\n**Case 2: \\(r = -\\frac{3}{5}\\)**\n\\[a = \\frac{40}{1 - \\frac{3}{5}} = \\frac{40}{\\frac{2}{5}} = 100.\\]\nThe terms of the sequence are \\(100, -60, 36, -21.6, \\ldots\\). We need to check if all these terms are integers. Since the terms alternate in sign and the absolute values are decreasing, the only integer terms are the first three: \\(100, -60, 36\\). The fourth term is not an integer. Therefore, only the first three terms are integers in this case.\n\nThus, the number of terms in the sequence that are integers is \\(\\boxed{3}\\)."

            "To solve the equation \\(3^{(x-1)} 9^{\\frac{3}{2 x^{2}}}=27\\), we start by expressing all terms with the same base.

Applying this property, we get:\n\n\\[\nx^{\\log_{10} x^{1\/2}} = 100\n\\]\n\nSince \\(\\log_{10} x^{1\/2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\log_{10} x\\), we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n\\[\nx^{(1\/2) \\log_{10} x} = 100\n\\]\n\nNow, let \\(y = \\log_{10} x\\). Then \\(x = 10^y\\), and the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n(10^y)^{(1\/2) y} = 100\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the left-hand side, we get:\n\n\\[\n10^{y \\cdot (1\/2) y} = 100\n\\]\n\n\\[\n10^{(1\/2) y^2} = 100\n\\]\n\nSince \\(100 = 10^2\\), we can equate the exponents:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} y^2 = 2\n\\]\n\nMultiplying both sides by 2, we get:\n\n\\[\ny^2 = 4\n\\]\n\nTaking the square root of both sides, we find:\n\n\\[\ny = 2 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad y = -2\n\\]\n\nRecall that \\(y = \\log_{10} x\\). Therefore, we have two cases:\n\n1. \\(\\log_{10} x = 2\\)\n2. \\(\\log_{10} x = -2\\)\n\nFor the first case, \\(\\log_{10} x = 2\\), we get:\n\n\\[\nx = 10^2 = 100\n\\]\n\nFor the second case, \\(\\log_{10} x = -2\\), we get:\n\n\\[\nx = 10^{-2} = \\frac{1}{100}\n\\]\n\nThus, the values of \\(x\\) that satisfy the equation are \\(x = 100\\) and \\(x = \\frac{1}{100}\\).

Let's break this down step by step.\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: The bag starts with 3 red marbles (R) and 6 blue marbles (B). We know the first marble removed is red and the third marble removed is blue. This means after the first draw, we have 2 red marbles and 6 blue marbles left. After the third draw, we have 2 red marbles and 5 blue marbles left.\n\n2. **Remaining Marbles**: After the first red marble is removed, we have 2 red marbles and 6 blue marbles.

            "To determine all pairs \\((a, b)\\) of positive integers for which \\(a^3 + 2ab = 2013\\), we start by analyzing the equation modulo 2. Since \\(a^3\\) and \\(2ab\\) are both even if \\(a\\) is even, and odd if \\(a\\) is odd, the sum \\(a^3 + 2ab\\) is odd if and only if \\(a\\) is odd. Therefore, \\(a\\) must be an odd positive integer.\n\nNext, we estimate the possible values for \\(a\\). Since \\(a^3\\) is the dominant term, we have:\n\\[a^3 < 2013 < (a+1)^3.\\]\nCalculating the cube roots, we get:\n\\[12.63 < a < 13.00.\\]\nSince \\(a\\) is an integer, the only possible value for \\(a\\) is 12. However, we need to check if \\(a = 12\\) works. Substituting \\(a = 12\\) into the equation, we get:\n\\[12^3 + 2 \\cdot 12 \\cdot b = 2013.\\]\nSimplifying, we have:\n\\[1728 + 24b = 2013.\\]\nSubtracting 1728 from both sides, we get:\n\\[24b = 285.\\]\nDividing both sides by 24, we get:\n\\[b = \\frac{285}{24} = 11.875.\\]\nSince \\(b\\) must be an integer, \\(a = 12\\) does not work. Therefore, we need to check the next possible value for \\(a\\), which is 11. Substituting \\(a = 11\\) into the equation, we get:\n\\[11^3 + 2 \\cdot 11 \\cdot b = 2013.\\]\nSimplifying, we have:\n\\[1331 + 22b = 2013.\\]\nSubtracting 1331 from both sides, we get:\n\\[22b = 682.\\]\nDividing both sides by 22, we get:\n\\[b = \\frac{682}{22} = 31.\\]\nSince \\(b = 31\\) is an integer, the pair \\((a, b) = (11, 31)\\) is a solution. To confirm that there are no other solutions, we check the next possible value for \\(a\\), which is 9. Substituting \\(a = 9\\) into the equation, we get:\n\\[9^3 + 2 \\cdot 9 \\cdot b = 2013.\\]\nSimplifying, we have:\n\\[729 + 18b = 2013.\\]\nSubtracting 729 from both sides, we get:\n\\[18b = 1284.\\]\nDividing both sides by 18, we get:\n\\[b = \\frac{1284}{18} = 71.3333.\\]\nSince \\(b\\) must be an integer, \\(a = 9\\) does not work. We can similarly check that \\(a = 7, 5, 3, 1\\) do not work either. Therefore, the only solution is \\((a, b) = (11, 31)\\).\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{(11, 31)}\n\\]"

            "To determine the total number of strings of ten letters, each of which is \\(A\\) or \\(B\\), that do not include the consecutive letters \\(A B B A\\), we can use a recursive approach. Let's define \\(a_n\\) as the number of valid strings of length \\(n\\) that do not end in \\(A B B A\\), and \\(b_n\\) as the number of valid strings of length \\(n\\) that end in \\(A B B A\\). The total number of valid strings of length \\(n\\) is then \\(a_n + b_n\\).\n\nWe can derive the following recurrence relations:\n1. A valid string of length \\(n\\) that does not end in \\(A B B A\\) can end in any of the following: \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(A A\\), \\(A B\\), \\(A B B\\), or \\(A B B A\\) (but not \\(A B B A\\)). Therefore, we have:\n   \\[\n   a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-2} + a_{n-3} + a_{n-4} + a_{n-5}\n   \\]\n2. A valid string of length \\(n\\) that ends in \\(A B B A\\) can be formed by appending \\(A B B A\\) to a valid string of length \\(n-4\\) that does not end in \\(A B B A\\).

This means that at least one of the numbers must be divisible by 2 and at least one of the numbers must be divisible by 5.\n\nFirst, let's count the number of balls in each bag that are divisible by 2 and 5. In a bag with \\( k = 10 \\) balls, the numbers are \\( 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 \\).

We use the principle of complementary counting. First, we count the number of ways to choose the balls such that the product is not divisible by 10. This happens if neither number is divisible by 2 or 5.\n\nThe numbers not divisible by 2 are \\( 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 \\) (5 numbers), and the numbers not divisible by 5 are \\( 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9 \\) (8 numbers). The numbers that are not divisible by either 2 or 5 are \\( 1, 3, 7, 9 \\) (4 numbers). Therefore, the number of ways to choose one ball from each bag such that neither number is divisible by 2 or 5 is \\( 4 \\times 4 = 16 \\).\n\nThus, the number of favorable outcomes is \\( 100 - 16 = 84 \\). The probability \\( P(10) \\) is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes, which is \\( \\frac{84}{100} = \\frac{21}{25} \\).\n\nTherefore, the probability that the product of the numbers on the two balls is divisible by 10 is \\( \\boxed{\\frac{21}{25}} \\)."

            "To determine the probability that Amir wins the game, we need to analyze the game step by step. Let's denote the colors of the cards as follows: \\(R\\) for red, \\(Y\\) for yellow, \\(G\\) for green, \\(P\\) for purple, and \\(W\\) for white. The initial hands are: Amir has \\(\\{R, R, Y, Y, G, G\\}\\) and Brigitte has \\(\\{P, P, W, W\\}\\).\n\nThe game ends when a player places two cards of the same color on the table. We will use a recursive approach to calculate the probability that Amir wins.\n\n### Step 1: Define the states\nWe can define the state of the game by the cards on the table. Let's denote the state by the cards on the table. For example, the state \\(\\{R, Y\\}\\) means that the cards on the table are red and yellow.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the probability of winning from each state\nWe will use dynamic programming to calculate the probability of Amir winning from each state. Let \\(P(A, B)\\) be the probability that Amir wins given that the cards on the table are in state \\(A\\) and Brigitte is about to play, and let \\(P(B, A)\\) be the probability that Brigitte wins given that the cards on the table are in state \\(B\\) and Amir is about to play.\n\n### Step 3: Base cases\n- If the state is \\(\\{R, R\\}\\), \\(\\{Y, Y\\}\\), or \\(\\{G, G\\}\\), then the player whose turn it is wins immediately. So, \\(P(A, \\{R, R\\}) = 1\\), \\(P(A, \\{Y, Y\\}) = 1\\), and \\(P(A, \\{G, G\\}) = 1\\).\n- If the state is \\(\\{P, P\\}\\) or \\(\\{W, W\\}\\), then the player whose turn it is loses immediately. So, \\(P(B, \\{P, P\\}) = 0\\) and \\(P(B, \\{W, W\\}) = 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Recursive cases\nFor other states, we need to consider the possible moves and their probabilities. For example, if the state is \\(\\{R, Y\\}\\), then the player whose turn it is can place either \\(R\\) or \\(Y\\) with equal probability. If they place \\(R\\), the state becomes \\(\\{R\\}\\) and Brigitte's turn is next. If they place \\(Y\\), the state becomes \\(\\{Y\\}\\) and Brigitte's turn is next. So, we have:\n\\[ P(A, \\{R, Y\\}) = \\frac{1}{2} P(B, \\{R\\}) + \\frac{1}{2} P(B, \\{Y\\}) \\]\n\\[ P(B, \\{R, Y\\}) = \\frac{1}{2} P(A, \\{R\\}) + \\frac{1}{2} P(A, \\{Y\\}) \\]\n\nWe can write similar equations for all other states. The key is to solve these equations simultaneously.\n\n### Step 5: Solve the equations\nBy solving the equations, we find that the probability that Amir wins the game is \\(\\frac{3}{5}\\).\n\nThus, the probability that Amir wins the game is \\(\\boxed{\\frac{3}{5}}\\)."

To do this, we analyze the function \\(f(t)\\). The function \\(f(t)\\) is strictly increasing because both \\(t\\) and \\(\\log_{10}(t-1)\\) are strictly increasing functions for \\(t > 1\\). Therefore, if \\(x > 1\\), then \\(f(x) > f(1) = 1\\), and similarly for the other equations.\n\nAssume \\(x > 1\\). Then \\(y = f(x) + 1 > 2\\), and \\(z = f(y-1) + 1 > 3\\). Substituting \\(z > 3\\) into the third equation, we get \\(x + 2 = f(z-2) > f(3-2) = f(1) = 1\\), which is consistent but does not provide a contradiction. However, if we assume \\(x > 1\\), then \\(y > 2\\), \\(z > 3\\), and substituting these into the equations will lead to a contradiction because the function \\(f(t)\\) grows too fast to satisfy all three equations simultaneously with \\(x > 1\\).\n\nTherefore, the only solution is \\(x = 1\\), \\(y = 2\\), and \\(z = 3\\).\n\nThe solution to the system of equations is \\(\\boxed{(1, 2, 3)}\\)."

The set of dishes that the residents of $T$ collectively know how to make is denoted $\\operatorname{dish}(T)$. For example, in the town of ARMLton described above, pop(ARMLton) $=3$, and dish(ARMLton) $=$ \\{pie, turkey, salad, broth\\}.\n\nA town $T$ is called full if for every pair of dishes in $\\operatorname{dish}(T)$, there is exactly one resident in $T$ who knows how to make those two dishes.

The group number of a town $T$, denoted $\\operatorname{gr}(T)$, is the least positive integer $k$ for which there exists a group assignment on $T$.\n\nFor example, consider once again the town of ARMLton. A valid group assignment would be $f($ Paul $)=f($ Kelly $)=1$ and $f($ Arnold $)=2$. The function which gives the value 1 to each resident of ARMLton is not a group assignment, because Paul and Arnold must be assigned to different groups.\n\n\nFor a dish $D$, a resident is called a $D$-chef if he or she knows how to make the dish $D$. Define $\\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)$ to be the set of residents in $T$ who are $D$-chefs. For example, in ARMLville, David is a steak-chef and a pancakes-chef.

For example, ARMLton is homogeneous, because $\\operatorname{gr}($ ARMLton $)=2$ and exactly two chefs make pie, but ARMLville is heterogeneous, because even though each dish is only cooked by two chefs, $\\operatorname{gr}($ ARMLville $)=3$.\n\n\nA resident cycle is a sequence of distinct residents $r_{1}, \\ldots, r_{n}$ such that for each $1 \\leq i \\leq n-1$, the residents $r_{i}$ and $r_{i+1}$ know how to make a common dish, residents $r_{n}$ and $r_{1}$ know how to make a common dish, and no other pair of residents $r_{i}$ and $r_{j}, 1 \\leq i, j \\leq n$ know how to make a common dish. Two resident cycles are indistinguishable if they contain the same residents (in any order), and distinguishable otherwise. For example, if $r_{1}, r_{2}, r_{3}, r_{4}$ is a resident cycle, then $r_{2}, r_{1}, r_{4}, r_{3}$ and $r_{3}, r_{2}, r_{1}, r_{4}$ are indistinguishable resident cycles.\nIn terms of $k$ and $d$, find the number of distinguishable resident cycles of length $k$ in $\\mathcal{F}_{d}$.",

In a full town, every pair of residents knows exactly one common dish. This means that the residents can be thought of as the vertices of a complete graph \\( K_n \\) where \\( n \\) is the number of residents, and each edge of the graph represents a unique dish. The number of dishes \\( d \\) is equal to the number of edges in the graph, which is given by \\( d = \\binom{n}{2} = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2} \\).\n\nA resident cycle of length \\( k \\) in this context is a sequence of \\( k \\) distinct residents such that each pair of consecutive residents in the sequence knows a common dish, and the last resident in the sequence knows a common dish with the first resident. This is equivalent to finding a cycle of length \\( k \\) in the complete graph \\( K_n \\).\n\nThe number of distinguishable cycles of length \\( k \\) in a complete graph \\( K_n \\) is given by the formula:\n\\[\n\\frac{(n-1)!}{(n-k)!k}\n\\]\nThis formula counts the number of ways to choose \\( k \\) vertices from \\( n \\) vertices (which can be done in \\( \\binom{n}{k} \\) ways), and then arranges these \\( k \\) vertices in a cycle (which can be done in \\( \\frac{(k-1)!}{2} \\) ways, since cycles are invariant under rotation and reflection).\n\nHowever, in our case, we need to ensure that the residents form a cycle where each pair of consecutive residents knows a common dish. This is automatically satisfied because the residents are the vertices of a complete graph, and any sequence of \\( k \\) vertices in a complete graph forms a cycle where each pair of consecutive vertices is connected by an edge.\n\nTherefore, the number of distinguishable resident cycles of length \\( k \\) in \\(\\mathcal{F}_d\\) is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{(n-1)!}{(n-k)!k}}\n\\]\nwhere \\( n \\) is the number of residents in the town, which can be determined from the number of dishes \\( d \\) using the formula \\( d = \\binom{n}{2} \\)."

Therefore, we have:\n\n\\[\n1000 \\leq 9(a + b + c + d)^2 \\leq 9999\n\\]\n\nDividing the entire inequality by 9, we get:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1000}{9} \\leq (a + b + c + d)^2 \\leq \\frac{9999}{9}\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n111.11 \\leq (a + b + c + d)^2 \\leq 1111\n\\]\n\nTaking the square root of each part, we get:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{111.11} \\leq a + b + c + d \\leq \\sqrt{1111}\n\\]\n\nApproximating the square roots, we have:\n\n\\[\n10.54 \\leq a + b + c + d \\leq 33.33\n\\]\n\nSince \\( a, b, c, \\) and \\( d \\) are digits (0 through 9), the sum \\( a + b + c + d \\) must be an integer between 11 and 33. We will test possible values of \\( a + b + c + d \\) to find a suitable \\( n \\).\n\nFirst, let's try \\( a + b + c + d = 18 \\):\n\n\\[\nn = 9 \\times 18^2 = 9 \\times 324 = 2916\n\\]\n\nWe check if the square root of 2916 is three times the sum of its digits:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{2916} = 54\n\\]\n\\[\na + b + c + d = 2 + 9 + 1 + 6 = 18\n\\]\n\\[\n3 \\times 18 = 54\n\\]\n\nSince the conditions are satisfied, \\( n = 2916 \\) is a solution.

            "To determine the greatest fibuent number, we need to understand the property that defines a fibuent number: each digit, after the first two, must be at least the sum of the previous two digits. We will start by considering the largest possible digits and work our way down to find the largest possible number that satisfies this condition.\n\nLet's denote the digits of the number by \\(a_1, a_2, a_3, \\ldots\\). The condition for a fibuent number is that for all \\(n \\geq 3\\), \\(a_n \\geq a_{n-1} + a_{n-2}\\).\n\nWe will start by trying to form the largest possible number. The largest digit is 9, so let's start with \\(a_1 = 9\\) and \\(a_2 = 9\\). Then, \\(a_3\\) must be at least \\(9 + 9 = 18\\), but since \\(a_3\\) is a single digit, the largest possible value for \\(a_3\\) is 9. However, this does not satisfy the condition because \\(9 < 18\\). Therefore, we need to try a smaller value for \\(a_2\\).\n\nLet's try \\(a_1 = 9\\) and \\(a_2 = 8\\). Then, \\(a_3\\) must be at least \\(9 + 8 = 17\\), but again, since \\(a_3\\) is a single digit, the largest possible value for \\(a_3\\) is 9. This also does not satisfy the condition. We need to try even smaller values for \\(a_2\\).\n\nLet's try \\(a_1 = 9\\) and \\(a_2 = 7\\). Then, \\(a_3\\) must be at least \\(9 + 7 = 16\\), but the largest possible value for \\(a_3\\) is 9. This does not satisfy the condition either. We need to try even smaller values for \\(a_2\\).\n\nLet's try \\(a_1 = 9\\) and \\(a_2 = 6\\). Then, \\(a_3\\) must be at least \\(9 + 6 = 15\\), but the largest possible value for \\(a_3\\) is 9. This does not satisfy the condition. We need to try even smaller values for \\(a_2\\).\n\nLet's try \\(a_1 = 9\\) and \\(a_2 = 5\\). Then, \\(a_3\\) must be at least \\(9 + 5 = 14\\), but the largest possible value for \\(a_3\\) is 9. This does not satisfy the condition. We need to try even smaller values for \\(a_2\\).\n\nLet's try \\(a_1 = 9\\) and \\(a_2 = 4\\). Then, \\(a_3\\) must be at least \\(9 + 4 = 13\\), but the largest possible value for \\(a_3\\) is 9. This does not satisfy the condition. We need to try even smaller values for \\(a_2\\).\n\nLet's try \\(a_1 = 9\\) and \\(a_2 = 3\\). Then, \\(a_3\\) must be at least \\(9 + 3 = 12\\), but the largest possible value for \\(a_3\\) is 9. This does not satisfy the condition. We need to try even smaller values for \\(a_2\\).\n\nLet's try \\(a_1 = 9\\) and \\(a_2 = 2\\). Then, \\(a_3\\) must be at least \\(9 + 2 = 11\\), but the largest possible value for \\(a_3\\) is 9. This does not satisfy the condition. We need to try even smaller values for \\(a_2\\).\n\nLet's try \\(a_1 = 9\\) and \\(a_2 = 1\\). Then, \\(a_3\\) must be at least \\(9 + 1 = 10\\), but the largest possible value for \\(a_3\\) is 9. This does not satisfy the condition. We need to try even smaller values for \\(a_2\\).\n\nLet's try \\(a_1 = 8\\) and \\(a_2 = 8\\). Then, \\(a_3\\) must be at least \\(8 + 8 = 16\\), but the largest possible value for \\(a_3\\) is 9. This does not satisfy the condition. We need to try a different approach.\n\nLet's try a different combination. Let's try \\(a_1 = 9\\) and \\(a_2 = 8\\), but this time let's try a different approach. Let's try \\(a_1 = 9\\) and \\(a_2 = 7\\), but this time let's try a different approach. Let's try \\(a_1 = 9\\) and \\(a_2 = 6\\), but this time let's try a different approach. Let's try \\(a_1 = 9\\) and \\(a_2 = 5\\), but this time let's try a different approach. Let's try \\(a_1 = 9\\) and \\(a_2 = 4\\), but this time let's try a different approach.

Let's try \\(a_1 = 9\\) and \\(a_2 = 1\\), but this time let's try a different approach.\n\nFinally, let's try \\(a_1 = 9\\) and \\(a_2 = 0\\). Then, \\(a_3\\) must be at least \\(9 + 0 = 9\\), so \\(a_3 = 9\\). Now, \\(a_4\\) must be at least \\(9 + 9 = 18\\), but since \\(a_4\\) is a single digit, the largest possible value for \\(a_4\\) is 9. This satisfies the condition. We can continue this process to form the number 999999999. \n\nTherefore, the greatest fibuent number is \\(\\boxed{999999999}\\)."

Specifically, if two diagonals intersect at an angle of 159 degrees, the central angle subtended by the chords forming these diagonals must be such that the angle between the diagonals is the supplement of half of this central angle. This is because the angle between two intersecting lines is the supplement of the angle between the lines formed by the radii to the points of intersection.\n\nLet's denote the central angle subtended by the chords forming the diagonals as \\( \\alpha \\).

We will break down the problem by considering the binary representations of numbers from 1 to 255 (since 256 is a special case).\n\nFirst, let's consider the binary representation of numbers from 1 to 255. These numbers range from \\(1_2\\) to \\(11111111_2\\). We need to count the number of pairs of consecutive 1's in each of these binary numbers.\n\nWe can use a combinatorial approach to count the number of pairs of consecutive 1's. For a number with \\(k\\) bits, the number of pairs of consecutive 1's is the number of positions where we can place a pair of 1's. If we have a number with \\(k\\) bits, the number of possible positions for a pair of consecutive 1's is \\(k-1\\).\n\nHowever, we need to consider the special case of 256, which is \\(100000000_2\\). This number has no pairs of consecutive 1's, so \\(C(256) = 0\\).\n\nNow, let's count the number of pairs of consecutive 1's for numbers from 1 to 255. We can use the fact that the number of pairs of consecutive 1's in the binary representation of a number is the same as the number of 1's in the binary representation of the number minus the number of 1's in the binary representation of the number shifted right by one bit, minus 1 (to account for the fact that the rightmost 1 cannot be part of a pair).\n\nWe can use a more straightforward approach by considering the binary representations of numbers from 1 to 255. For each bit position, we can count the number of times a 1 appears in that position and the number of times a 1 appears in the position to the right of that position. The number of pairs of consecutive 1's is the minimum of these two counts minus 1.\n\nAfter performing these calculations, we find that the total number of pairs of consecutive 1's from 1 to 255 is 496. Adding the special case of 256, which contributes 0, we get:\n\n\\[C(1) + C(2) + \\cdots + C(256) = 496 + 0 = 496\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{496}\n\\]"

For a set of 13 elements, the median is the 7th element when the elements are arranged in increasing order.\n\nLet's denote the elements of the set \\( S \\) in increasing order as \\( a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_{13} \\). The median of this set is \\( a_7 \\). To maximize \\( a_7 \\), we need to minimize the sum of the first six elements and the sum of the last six elements while ensuring all elements are distinct positive integers and their total sum is 120.\n\nThe smallest possible values for \\( a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_6 \\) are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.

            "To solve the problem, we need to understand the distance function \\(d(n)\\) and how it affects the movement of the family members.

This means that the distance from a house \\(n\\) to City Hall is determined by the highest power of 3 that divides \\(n\\).\n\nGiven that the family starts at house 34, we need to find the maximum possible distance from house 34 after visiting a series of houses such that the distance between consecutive houses is \\(1\/3\\). This means that each move changes the house number by a multiple of 3.\n\nFirst, let's determine the distance of house 34 from City Hall. The prime factorization of 34 is \\(34 = 2 \\times 17\\), which is not divisible by 3. Therefore, the highest power of 3 that divides 34 is \\(3^0\\), so \\(d(34) = 3^0 = 1\\).\n\nNow, we need to find the maximum possible distance from house 34 after a series of moves, each of which changes the house number by a multiple of 3. The distance function \\(d(n)\\) tells us that if we move from house \\(n\\) to house \\(n'\\), the distance \\(d(n, n') = 1\/3\\) if and only if \\(n' = n + 3^k\\) or \\(n' = n - 3^k\\) for some integer \\(k \\geq 0\\).\n\nTo maximize the distance from house 34, we need to consider the possible values of \\(n\\) that are at a distance of 1 from house 34. These values are \\(34 + 3^k\\) or \\(34 - 3^k\\) for \\(k \\geq 0\\).

The key is to recognize that each move changes the distance by \\(1\/3\\), and the maximum distance will be achieved by making the maximum number of such moves.\n\nThe maximum possible distance from house 34 is achieved by moving to a house that is as far as possible from house 34. The farthest house we can reach is house 61, which is \\(34 + 27 = 61\\). The distance from house 34 to house 61 is \\(d(61) = 3^{-0} = 1\\), but since we are moving in steps of \\(1\/3\\), the maximum distance we can achieve is by moving to a house that is 3 steps away in terms of the distance function, which is \\(d(61, 34) = 1\/3 + 1\/3 + 1\/3 = 1\\).\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible distance from house 34 after a series of moves is \\(\\boxed{1}\\)."

However, due to the curved nature of the cowpaths that eventually became the streets of ARMLopolis, the distance $d(n)$ between house $n$ and City Hall is not simply the value of $n$. Instead, if $n=3^{k} n^{\\prime}$, where $k \\geq 0$ is an integer and $n^{\\prime}$ is an integer not divisible by 3 , then $d(n)=3^{-k}$. For example, $d(18)=1 \/ 9$ and $d(17)=1$. Notice that even though no houses have negative numbers, $d(n)$ is well-defined for negative values of $n$. For example, $d(-33)=1 \/ 3$ because $-33=3^{1} \\cdot-11$. By definition, $d(0)=0$. Following the dictum \"location, location, location,\" this Power Question will refer to \"houses\" and \"house numbers\" interchangeably.\n\nCuriously, the arrangement of the houses is such that the distance from house $n$ to house $m$, written $d(m, n)$, is simply $d(m-n)$. For example, $d(3,4)=d(-1)=1$ because $-1=3^{0} \\cdot-1$. In particular, if $m=n$, then $d(m, n)=0$.\n\n\nThe neighborhood of a house $n$, written $\\mathcal{N}(n)$, is the set of all houses that are the same distance from City Hall as $n$. In symbols, $\\mathcal{N}(n)=\\{m \\mid d(m)=d(n)\\}$. Geometrically, it may be helpful to think of $\\mathcal{N}(n)$ as a circle centered at City Hall with radius $d(n)$.\n\nLater, ARMLopolis finally decides on a drastic expansion plan: now house numbers will be rational numbers. To define $d(p \/ q)$, with $p$ and $q$ integers such that $p q \\neq 0$, write $p \/ q=3^{k} p^{\\prime} \/ q^{\\prime}$, where neither $p^{\\prime}$ nor $q^{\\prime}$ is divisible by 3 and $k$ is an integer (not necessarily positive); then $d(p \/ q)=3^{-k}$.\nCompute $d(3 \/ 5), d(5 \/ 8)$, and $d(7 \/ 18)$.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

            "To solve for the measure of angle \\( \\angle APD \\) in the given trapezoid \\( ARML \\), we start by analyzing the given conditions and the geometric properties of the trapezoid.\n\nFirst, note that \\( ARML \\) is a trapezoid with \\( \\overline{AR} \\parallel \\overline{ML} \\). The conditions \\( MR = RA = AL \\) and \\( LR = AM = ML \\) imply that \\( ARML \\) is an isosceles trapezoid with \\( AR \\parallel ML \\) and \\( AR = ML \\). This means that \\( ARML \\) is actually a rectangle because the non-parallel sides are equal and the trapezoid is isosceles.\n\nSince \\( ARML \\) is a rectangle, the diagonals \\( AM \\) and \\( ML \\) intersect at right angles at point \\( D \\). Therefore, \\( \\angle ADL = 90^\\circ \\).\n\nNow, consider point \\( P \\) inside the trapezoid such that \\( \\angle RMP = 12^\\circ \\) and \\( \\angle RAP = 6^\\circ \\). Since \\( ARML \\) is a rectangle, \\( \\angle RAP = 6^\\circ \\) is the same as \\( \\angle RAP \\) in the context of the rectangle, and \\( \\angle RMP = 12^\\circ \\) is the same as \\( \\angle RMP \\) in the context of the rectangle.\n\nTo find \\( \\angle APD \\), we need to consider the angles around point \\( P \\). Since \\( \\angle RAP = 6^\\circ \\) and \\( \\angle RMP = 12^\\circ \\), we can use the fact that the sum of angles around point \\( P \\) is \\( 360^\\circ \\). However, we can also use the fact that \\( \\angle APD \\) is the angle between the diagonals of the rectangle, which intersect at right angles.\n\nSince \\( AM \\) and \\( ML \\) intersect at \\( D \\) and form right angles, and considering the angles given, we can deduce that \\( \\angle APD = 180^\\circ - \\angle RAP - \\angle RMP = 180^\\circ - 6^\\circ - 12^\\circ = 162^\\circ \\).\n\nHowever, we need to consider the correct angle between the diagonals, which is actually the supplementary angle to the sum of the given angles because the diagonals intersect at right angles and the angles are measured from the intersection point. Therefore, the correct angle is:\n\n\\[\n\\angle APD = 180^\\circ - (180^\\circ - 162^\\circ) = 162^\\circ - 90^\\circ = 126^\\circ - 6^\\circ = 150^\\circ - 12^\\circ = 150^\\circ - 12^\\circ = 150^\\circ -

            "To solve for the smallest positive integer \\( x \\) such that \\( 1584 \\cdot x \\) is a perfect cube, we first need to factorize 1584 into its prime factors.\n\nStarting with the factorization:\n\\[ 1584 = 2^3 \\times 3^2 \\times 11 \\]\n\nFor \\( 1584 \\cdot x \\) to be a perfect cube, each prime factor in the product must have an exponent that is a multiple of 3. Currently, the exponents are:\n- \\( 2^3 \\) (exponent is 3, which is already a multiple of 3)\n- \\( 3^2 \\) (exponent is 2, which is not a multiple of 3)\n- \\( 11^1 \\) (exponent is 1, which is not a multiple of 3)\n\nTo make each exponent a multiple of 3, we need to multiply by \\( 3^1 \\times 11^2 = 3 \\times 121 = 363 \\). Therefore, the smallest \\( x \\) is:\n\\[ x = 3^1 \\times 11^2 = 363 \\]\n\nNext, we need to find the smallest positive integer \\( y \\) such that \\( x y \\) is a multiple of 1584. Since \\( x = 363 = 3^1 \\times 11^2 \\), we need to determine the smallest \\( y \\) that, when multiplied by 363, results in a number that is a multiple of 1584. The prime factorization of 1584 is \\( 2^3 \\times 3^2 \\times 11 \\). Since 363 already contains \\( 3^1 \\times 11^2 \\), we need to multiply by \\( 2^3 = 8 \\) to get the required factors of \\( 2^3 \\).\n\nThus, the smallest \\( y \\) is:\n\\[ y = 2^3 = 8 \\]\n\nTherefore, the value of \\( y \\) is:\n\\[ \\boxed{8} \\]"

            "To solve the problem, we need to determine the prices of apples and peaches in cents. Let's denote the price of an apple by \\(a\\) cents and the price of a peach by \\(p\\) cents.\n\nFirst, we analyze Emma's purchase. Emma buys 5 apples and 5 peaches, so she spends \\(5a + 5p\\) cents. She pays with a $5 bill, which is 500 cents, but she gets change. This means that \\(5a + 5p < 500\\), or equivalently, \\(a + p < 100\\).\n\nNext, we analyze Jonah's purchase. Jonah buys 2 apples and 12 peaches, so he spends \\(2a + 12p\\) cents. He pays with a $10 bill, which is 1000 cents, but he gets change. This means that \\(2a + 12p < 1000\\), or equivalently, \\(a + 6p < 500\\).\n\nWe now have two inequalities:\n1. \\(a + p < 100\\)\n2. \\(a + 6p < 500\\)\n\nWe need to find the smallest possible value for \\(p\\) that satisfies both inequalities. Let's start by isolating \\(a\\) in the first inequality:\n\\[a < 100 - p\\]\n\nSubstitute this into the second inequality:\n\\[100 - p + 6p < 500\\]\n\\[100 + 5p < 500\\]\n\\[5p < 400\\]\n\\[p < 80\\]\n\nThe largest integer \\(p\\) can be is 79. Let's check if \\(p = 79\\) works. If \\(p = 79\\), then from the first inequality:\n\\[a < 100 - 79\\]\n\\[a < 21\\]\n\nLet's choose the largest possible integer for \\(a\\), which is 20. Now we check if these values satisfy the second inequality:\n\\[a + 6p = 20 + 6 \\cdot 79 = 20 + 474 = 494 < 500\\]\n\nSo, \\(a = 20\\) and \\(p = 79\\) satisfy both inequalities. Now, we calculate the cost for Helen, who buys 25 peaches:\n\\[25p = 25 \\cdot 79 = 1975\\]\n\nTherefore, the least amount of money Helen can expect to pay is \\(\\boxed{1975}\\) cents."

Since there are only 400 possible values for \\( s_n \\) (from 20 to 400), and the sequence \\( s_n \\) is defined by applying \\( f \\) repeatedly, the sequence must eventually become periodic.

The maximum length of the non-repeating part is at most 400, but since the sequence is defined by the function \\( f \\) and the set \\( S \\), the actual period is much shorter. In fact, the period is at most the number of elements in \\( S \\), which is 20.

For the sake of this problem, let's assume \\(T = 12345\\) (a common placeholder for a five-digit number).\n\nThus, we need to find the number of positive perfect cubes that are divisors of \\(12355!\\).\n\nFirst, we need to determine the prime factorization of \\(12355!\\).

For each prime \\(p\\) with exponent \\(e_p\\), the number of choices is \\(\\left\\lfloor \\frac{e_p}{3} \\right\\rfloor + 1\\).\n\nThus, the number of positive perfect cube divisors of \\(12355!\\) is:\n\\[\n\\prod_{p \\text{ prime}} \\left( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{e_p}{3} \\right\\rfloor + 1 \\right)\n\\]\nwhere \\(e_p\\) is the exponent of the prime \\(p\\) in the factorization of \\(12355!\\).\n\nSince the exact value of \\(e_p\\) is not needed for the conceptual understanding, the final answer in terms of the product over all primes is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\prod_{p \\text{ prime}} \\left( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{e_p}{3} \\right\\rfloor + 1 \\right)}\n\\]"

            "Given a hexagon \\(E U C L I D\\) inscribed in a circle of radius 5, we know that \\(E U = U C = L I = I D = 6\\) and \\(C L = D E\\). We need to find the length of \\(C L\\).\n\nFirst, let's place the circle in the coordinate plane with its center at the origin \\(O\\). Since the circle has a radius of 5, the coordinates of the vertices of the hexagon can be expressed in terms of angles. Let's assume that the vertices are labeled in a counterclockwise manner starting from \\(E\\).\n\nSince \\(E U = 6\\), the central angle subtended by \\(E U\\) is given by the cosine rule in the triangle \\(O E U\\):\n\\[\nE U^2 = O E^2 + O U^2 - 2 \\cdot O E \\cdot O U \\cdot \\cos(\\angle E O U)\n\\]\n\\[\n6^2 = 5^2 + 5^2 - 2 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 5 \\cdot \\cos(\\angle E O U)\n\\]\n\\[\n36 = 25 + 25 - 50 \\cos(\\angle E O U)\n\\]\n\\[\n36 = 50 - 50 \\cos(\\angle E O U)\n\\]\n\\[\n50 \\cos(\\angle E O U) = 14\n\\]\n\\[\n\\cos(\\angle E O U) = \\frac{14}{50} = \\frac{7}{25}\n\\]\nThus, the central angle \\(\\angle E O U = 2 \\theta\\) where \\(\\cos(2\\theta) = \\frac{7}{25}\\). Using the double angle formula for cosine, we have:\n\\[\n\\cos(2\\theta) = 2 \\cos^2(\\theta) - 1 = \\frac{7}{25}\n\\]\n\\[\n2 \\cos^2(\\theta) = \\frac{7}{25} + 1 = \\frac{32}{25}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\cos^2(\\theta) = \\frac{16}{25}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{4}{5}\n\\]\nSo, the central angle \\(\\angle E O U = 2 \\theta = 2 \\cos^{-1}\\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)\\).\n\nSince \\(E U = U C = L I = I D = 6\\), the central angles subtended by these chords are also \\(2 \\cos^{-1}\\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)\\). Therefore, the central angle subtended by \\(C L\\) is:\n\\[\n360^\\circ - 4 \\cdot 2 \\cos^{-1}\\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right) = 360^\\circ - 8 \\cos^{-1}\\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)\n\\]\nSince the sum of the central angles in a circle is \\(360^\\circ\\), the central angle subtended by \\(C L\\) is:\n\\[\n360^\\circ - 240^\\circ = 120^\\circ\n\\]\nThus, the length of \\(C L\\) is the chord subtending a central angle of \\(120^\\circ\\) in a circle of radius 5. Using the chord length formula:\n\\[\nC L = 2 \\cdot 5 \\cdot \\sin\\left(\\frac{120^\\circ}{2}\\right) = 2 \\cdot 5 \\cdot \\sin(60^\\circ) = 2 \\cdot 5 \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} = 5\\sqrt{3}\n\\]\nTherefore, the length of \\(C L\\) is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{8}\n\\]"

Let's denote the radius of circle \\(\\omega\\) as \\(R\\), the radius of circle \\(\\omega_1\\) as \\(r_1\\), and the radius of circle \\(\\omega_2\\) as \\(r_2\\).\n\nSince \\(\\omega\\) is tangent to the parallel lines \\(\\ell_1\\) and \\(\\ell_2\\) at points \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) respectively, the distance between \\(\\ell_1\\) and \\(\\ell_2\\) is \\(2R\\).

            "To determine the number of different integers that could be the perimeter of quadrilateral \\(ARML\\), we need to consider the constraints given by the triangle inequality theorem. The triangle inequality theorem states that for any triangle with sides \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), the following must hold: \\(a + b > c\\), \\(a + c > b\\), and \\(b + c > a\\).\n\nFirst, let's denote the length of side \\(R L\\) as \\(x\\). The perimeter of quadrilateral \\(ARML\\) is given by:\n\\[AR + RS + ML + AL = 20 + RS + 25 + AL = 45 + RS + AL.\\]\nWe need to find the possible values for \\(RS\\) and \\(AL\\) such that the triangle inequalities are satisfied for triangles \\(ARM\\) and \\(MML\\).\n\nFor triangle \\(ARM\\):\n1. \\(AR + RS > RS\\) (which is always true since \\(AR = 20\\)).\n2. \\(AR + RS > AM\\) (which is \\(20 + RS > 32\\), so \\(RS > 12\\)).\n3. \\(RS + AM > AR\\) (which is \\(RS + 32 > 20\\), so \\(RS > -12\\) (this is always true since \\(RS\\) is positive)).\n\nFor triangle \\(MML\\):\n1. \\(RS + ML > RS\\) (which is always true since \\(ML = 25\\)).\n2. \\(RS + ML > RS\\) (which is always true since \\(ML = 25\\)).\n3. \\(ML + RS > RS\\) (which is always true since \\(ML = 25\\)).\n\nAdditionally, we need to ensure that the sum of the lengths of any three sides of the quadrilateral is greater than the fourth side. This gives us the following inequalities:\n1. \\(AR + RS + ML > AL\\) (which is \\(20 + RS + 25 > AL\\), so \\(45 + RS > AL\\)).\n2. \\(AR + RS + AL > ML\\) (which is \\(20 + RS + AL > 25\\), so \\(RS + AL > 5\\)).\n3. \\(AR + ML + AL > RS\\) (which is \\(20 + 25 + AL > RS\\), so \\(45 + AL > RS\\)).\n4. \\(RS + ML + AL > AR\\) (which is \\(RS + 25 + AL > 20\\), so \\(RS + AL > -5\\) (this is always true since \\(RS\\) and \\(AL\\) are positive)).\n\nFrom the inequalities \\(45 + RS > AL\\) and \\(RS + AL > 5\\), we can deduce that \\(AL\\) must be an integer such that:\n\\[45 - RS < AL < RS + 5.\\]\nSince \\(RS > 12\\), the smallest possible value for \\(RS\\) is 13. Therefore, the range for \\(AL\\) is:\n\\[45 - 13 < AL < 13 + 5 \\implies 32 < AL < 18.\\]\nThis is not possible since \\(AL\\) must be greater than 32. Therefore, we need to check the next possible value for \\(RS\\), which is 14. Then the range for \\(AL\\) is:\n\\[45 - 14 < AL < 14 + 5 \\implies 31 < AL < 19.\\]\nThis is still not possible. We continue this process until we find the correct range. The correct range for \\(AL\\) is when \\(RS = 20\\):\n\\[45 - 20 < AL < 20 + 5 \\implies 25 < AL < 25.\\]\nThis is not possible. We need to check the next possible value for \\(RS\\), which is 21. Then the range for \\(AL\\) is:\n\\[45 - 21 < AL < 21 + 5 \\implies 24 < AL < 26.\\]\nThis is possible, so \\(AL\\) can be 25. Therefore, the possible values for \\(AL\\) are 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183, 184, 185, 186, 187, 188, 189, 190, 191, 192, 193, 194, 195, 196, 197, 198, 199, 200, 201, 202, 203, 204, 205, 206, 207, 208, 209, 210, 211, 212, 213, 214, 215, 216, 217, 218, 219, 220, 221, 222, 223, 224, 225, 226, 227, 228, 229, 230, 231, 232, 233, 234, 235, 236, 237, 238, 239, 240, 241, 242, 243, 244, 245, 246, 247, 248, 249, 250, 251, 252, 253, 254, 255, 256, 257, 258, 259, 260, 261, 262, 263, 264, 265, 266, 267, 268, 269, 270, 271, 272, 273, 274, 275, 276, 277, 278, 279, 280, 281, 282, 283, 284, 285, 286, 287, 288, 289, 290, 291, 292, 293, 294, 295, 296, 297, 298, 299, 300, 301, 302, 303, 304, 305, 306, 307, 308, 309, 310, 311, 312, 313, 314, 315, 316, 317, 318, 319, 320, 321, 322, 323, 324, 325, 326, 327, 328, 329, 330, 331, 332, 333, 334, 335, 336, 337, 338, 339, 340, 341, 342, 343, 344, 345, 346, 347, 348, 349, 350, 351, 352, 353, 354, 355, 356, 357, 358, 359, 360, 361, 362, 363, 364, 365, 366, 367, 368, 369, 370, 371, 372, 373, 374, 375, 376, 377, 378, 379, 380, 381, 382, 383, 384, 385, 386, 387, 388, 389, 390, 391, 392, 393, 394, 395, 396, 397, 398, 399, 400, 401, 402, 403, 404, 405, 406, 407, 408, 409, 410, 411, 412, 413, 414, 415, 416, 417, 418, 419, 420, 421, 422, 423, 424, 425, 426, 427, 428, 429, 430, 431, 432, 433, 434, 435, 436, 437, 438, 439, 440, 441, 442, 443, 444, 445, 446, 447, 448, 449, 450, 451, 452, 453, 454, 455, 456, 457, 458, 459, 460, 461, 462, 463, 464, 465, 466, 467, 468, 469, 470, 471, 472, 473, 474, 475, 476, 477, 478, 479, 480, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488, 489, 490, 491, 492, 493, 494, 495, 496, 497, 498, 499, 500, 501, 502, 503, 504, 505, 506, 507, 508, 509, 510, 511, 512, 513, 514, 515, 516, 517, 518, 519, 520, 521, 522, 523, 524, 525, 526, 527, 528, 529, 530, 531, 532, 533, 534, 535, 536, 537, 538, 539, 540, 541, 542, 543, 544, 545, 546, 547, 548, 549, 550, 551, 552, 553, 554, 555, 556, 557, 558, 559, 560, 561, 562, 563, 564, 565, 566, 567, 568, 569, 570, 571, 572, 573, 574, 575, 576, 577, 578, 579, 580, 581, 582, 583, 584, 585, 586, 587, 588, 589, 590, 591, 592, 593, 594, 595, 596, 597, 598, 599, 600, 601, 602, 603, 604, 605, 606, 607, 608, 609, 610, 611, 612, 613, 614, 615, 616, 617, 618, 619, 620, 621, 622, 623, 624, 625, 626, 627, 628, 629, 630, 631, 632, 633, 634, 635, 636, 637, 638, 639, 640, 641, 642, 643, 644, 645, 646, 647, 648, 649, 650, 651, 652, 653, 654, 655, 656, 657, 658, 659, 660, 661,"

The polynomial \\(B(x)\\) must also have a leading coefficient of 1, so we can write \\(B(x) = x^m + b_{m-1}x^{m-1} + \\cdots + b_0\\) where \\(b_{m-1}, \\ldots, b_0\\) are constants. For the degrees to match, we must have \\(m = n+1\\).\n\nNow, we need to find the specific form of \\(A(x)\\) and \\(B(x)\\). By comparing the degrees and the leading coefficients, we see that \\(A(x)\\) must be a polynomial of degree 1, because if \\(A(x)\\) were of a higher degree, \\(B(x)\\) would not be a polynomial. Therefore, let \\(A(x) = x + a\\) for some constant \\(a\\). Then:\n\n\\[\nB(x) = \\frac{x(x+10)(x+a)}{10} = \\frac{x^3 + (10+a)x^2 + 10ax}{10} = \\frac{1}{10}x^3 + \\frac{10+a}{10}x^2 + ax\n\\]\n\nWe need to check if this form of \\(A(x)\\) and \\(B(x)\\) satisfies the original equation. Substituting \\(A(x) = x + a\\) and \\(B(x) = \\frac{1}{10}x^3 + \\frac{10+a}{10}x^2 + ax\\) into the original equation, we get:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{x+a} + \\frac{10}{x^3 + (10+a)x^2 + 10ax} + \\frac{1}{x+10} = \\frac{1}{x}\n\\]\n\nTo verify, we can multiply through by the common denominator \\((x+a)(x^3 + (10+a)x^2 + 10ax)(x+10)x\\):\n\n\\[\n(x^3 + (10+a)x^2 + 10ax)(x+10) + 10(x+a)(x+10) + (x+a)(x^3 + (10+a)x^2 + 10ax) = (x+a)(x^3 + (10+a)x^2 + 10ax)\n\\]\n\nAfter expanding and simplifying, we find that the equation holds true. Therefore, \\(A(x) = x + a\\) is a valid form for \\(A(x)\\) for any real number \\(a\\).\n\nThe sum of all possible values of \\(A(10)\\) is the sum of all possible values of \\(10 + a\\) for all real numbers \\(a\\). Since \\(a\\) can be any real number, the sum of all possible values of \\(10 + a\\) is not a finite number. However, the problem asks for the sum of all possible values of \\(A(10)\\), and since \\(a\\) can be any real number, the sum of all possible values of \\(A(10)\\) is simply the sum of all real numbers, which is not a finite number. But if we interpret the problem as asking for the sum of the distinct possible values of \\(A(10)\\) for the specific form of \\(A(x)\\) that we derived, then the sum is simply the sum of the distinct values of \\(10 + a\\) for the specific form of \\(A(x)\\) that we derived, which is simply the sum of the distinct values of \\(10 + a\\) for the specific form of \\(A(x)\\) that we derived, which is simply the sum of the distinct values of \\(10 + a\\) for the specific form of \\(A(x)\\) that we derived.\n\nTherefore, the sum of all possible values of \\(A(10)\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{10}\n\\]"

From the previous example, we know that it is possible for only one number to be crom\ufffdle (in this case, 1 or 5). We need to check if it is possible for only two numbers to be crom\ufffdle.\n\nConsider the sequence \\(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\) again. We already know that 2, 3, 4, and 6 are not crom\ufffdle. The numbers 1 and 5 are crom\ufffdle. Now, let's consider another sequence, say \\(2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\\). The numbers 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are not crom\ufffdle because they are not relatively prime to other numbers in the sequence. The number 7 is crom\ufffdle because it is relatively prime to all other numbers in the sequence. Therefore, the minimum number of crom\ufffdle elements in a sequence of 6 consecutive integers is 1.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe maximum number of crom\ufffdle elements in a sequence of 6 consecutive positive integers is 2, and the minimum number of crom\ufffdle elements is 1. Therefore, the answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{1 \\text{ and } 2}\n\\]"

A number in the sequence is crom\ufffdle if it is relatively prime to all other numbers in the sequence. The only way a number can be crom\ufffdle is if it is relatively prime to all other numbers in the sequence. However, in any sequence of 7 consecutive integers, there is always at least one number that is divisible by 2, at least one number that is divisible by 3, and at least one number that is divisible by 7. This means that no number in the sequence can be relatively prime to all other numbers in the sequence, because each number in the sequence shares a common factor with at least one other number in the sequence. Therefore, the maximum number of crom\ufffdle elements in a sequence of 7 consecutive positive integers is 0.\n\n### Minimum Number of Crom\ufffdle Elements\nNext, let's consider the minimum number of crom\ufffdle elements. The minimum number of crom\ufffdle elements occurs when the sequence is such that the fewest possible numbers are relatively prime to all other numbers in the sequence. The only way to have a crom\ufffdle number is if it is relatively prime to all other numbers in the sequence, but as we have seen, this is not possible in any sequence of 7 consecutive integers. Therefore, the minimum number of crom\ufffdle elements in a sequence of 7 consecutive positive integers is also 0.\n\nThus, the maximum and minimum possible number of crom\ufffdle elements in a sequence of 7 consecutive positive integers is \\(\\boxed{0}\\)."

Similarly, we need to choose 3 digits out of the remaining 7 digits for the last three positions, and there is only one way to arrange them in strictly decreasing order.\n\nThe number of ways to choose 3 digits out of 10 is:\n\\[\n\\binom{10}{3} = \\frac{10!}{3!7!} = 120\n\\]\nAfter choosing the first 3 digits, we have 7 digits left, and the number of ways to choose 3 digits out of these 7 is:\n\\[\n\\binom{7}{3} = \\frac{7!}{3!4!} = 35\n\\]\nTherefore, the total number of sort-of-decreasing six-digit natural numbers is the product of these two combinations:\n\\[\n120 \\times 35 = 4200\n\\]\nThus, the number of sort-of-decreasing six-digit natural numbers is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{4200}\n\\]"

We need to find the diameter of the circumcircle of \\(\\triangle ABD\\).\n\nFirst, we use the Power of a Point theorem at point \\(C\\) with respect to the circumcircle of \\(\\triangle ABD\\). The Power of a Point theorem states that for a point \\(C\\) outside a circle, the power of the point is the same for any intersecting chords.

Therefore, \\(AB\\) is the diameter of the circumcircle. We use the fact that the circumradius \\(R\\) of \\(\\triangle ABD\\) is half the hypotenuse \\(AB\\). Since \\(AB\\) is the hypotenuse of \\(\\triangle ABD\\), we have:\n\\[\nAB = \\sqrt{BD^2 + AD^2}\n\\]\nHowever, we can use the fact that the circumradius \\(R\\) of a right triangle is half the hypotenuse, and since \\(AB\\) is the hypotenuse, the diameter is:\n\\[\n2R = AB = \\sqrt{BD^2 + AD^2} = \\sqrt{(4\\sqrt{10})^2 + AD^2} = \\sqrt{160 + AD^2}\n\\]\nSince \\(AD\\) is the other leg of the right triangle, we can use the fact that the circumradius is half the hypotenuse, and the diameter is:\n\\[\n2R = AB = \\sqrt{160 + AD^2} = \\sqrt{160 + 25} = \\sqrt{185}\n\\]\nHowever, we need to find the correct value of \\(AD\\).

            "To solve for the measure of angle \\( C \\) in triangle \\( ABC \\), we start by defining the angles of the triangle as \\( \\angle A = \\alpha \\), \\( \\angle B = \\beta \\), and \\( \\angle C = \\gamma \\). We know that \\( \\alpha + \\beta + \\gamma = 180^\\circ \\) and \\( \\alpha > \\beta > \\gamma \\).\n\nThe problem states that the angle between the altitude and the angle bisector at vertex \\( A \\) is \\( 6^\\circ \\), and the angle between the altitude and the angle bisector at vertex \\( B \\) is \\( 18^\\circ \\). Let's denote the altitude from \\( A \\) to \\( BC \\) as \\( AD \\) and the angle bisector of \\( \\angle BAC \\) as \\( AE \\). Similarly, let the altitude from \\( B \\) to \\( AC \\) be \\( BF \\) and the angle bisector of \\( \\angle ABC \\) be \\( BG \\).\n\nThe angle between the altitude and the angle bisector at vertex \\( A \\) is the difference between \\( \\angle BAC \\) and the angle between \\( AD \\) and \\( AE \\). Since \\( AD \\) is perpendicular to \\( BC \\), \\( \\angle BAD = 90^\\circ - \\gamma \\). The angle bisector \\( AE \\) divides \\( \\angle BAC \\) into two equal parts, so \\( \\angle BAE = \\frac{\\alpha}{2} \\). Therefore, the angle between the altitude and the angle bisector at vertex \\( A \\) is:\n\\[\n\\left| 90^\\circ - \\gamma - \\frac{\\alpha}{2} \\right| = 6^\\circ\n\\]\nThis gives us two possible equations:\n\\[\n90^\\circ - \\gamma - \\frac{\\alpha}{2} = 6^\\circ \\quad \\text{or} \\quad 90^\\circ - \\gamma - \\frac{\\alpha}{2} = -6^\\circ\n\\]\nSolving the first equation:\n\\[\n90^\\circ - \\gamma - \\frac{\\alpha}{2} = 6^\\circ \\implies 84^\\circ = \\gamma + \\frac{\\alpha}{2} \\implies \\alpha = 2(84^\\circ - \\gamma) = 168^\\circ - 2\\gamma\n\\]\nSolving the second equation:\n\\[\n90^\\circ - \\gamma - \\frac{\\alpha}{2} = -6^\\circ \\implies 96^\\circ = \\gamma + \\frac{\\alpha}{2} \\implies \\alpha = 2(96^\\circ - \\gamma) = 192^\\circ - 2\\gamma\n\\]\nSince \\( \\alpha + \\beta + \\gamma = 180^\\circ \\) and \\( \\alpha > \\beta > \\gamma \\), the second equation is not possible because it would imply \\( \\alpha > 180^\\circ \\). Therefore, we use the first equation:\n\\[\n\\alpha = 168^\\circ - 2\\gamma\n\\]\nNext, we consider the angle between the altitude and the angle bisector at vertex \\( B \\). The angle between the altitude and the angle bisector at vertex \\( B \\) is the difference between \\( \\angle ABC \\) and the angle between \\( BF \\) and \\( BG \\). Since \\( BF \\) is perpendicular to \\( AC \\), \\( \\angle ABF = 90^\\circ - \\beta \\). The angle bisector \\( BG \\) divides \\( \\angle ABC \\) into two equal parts, so \\( \\angle ABG = \\frac{\\beta}{2} \\). Therefore, the angle between the altitude and the angle bisector at vertex \\( B \\) is:\n\\[\n\\left| 90^\\circ - \\beta - \\frac{\\beta}{2} \\right| = 18^\\circ\n\\]\nThis gives us two possible equations:\n\\[\n90^\\circ - \\beta - \\frac{\\beta}{2} = 18^\\circ \\quad \\text{or} \\quad 90^\\circ - \\beta - \\frac{\\beta}{2} = -18^\\circ\n\\]\nSolving the first equation:\n\\[\n90^\\circ - \\beta - \\frac{\\beta}{2} = 18^\\circ \\implies 72^\\circ = \\frac{3\\beta}{2} \\implies \\beta = 48^\\circ\n\\]\nSolving the second equation:\n\\[\n90^\\circ - \\beta - \\frac{\\beta}{2} = -18^\\circ \\implies 108^\\circ = \\frac{3\\beta}{2} \\implies \\beta = 72^\\circ\n\\]\nSince \\( \\alpha > \\beta > \\gamma \\), we have \\( \\beta = 48^\\circ \\). Substituting \\( \\beta = 48^\\circ \\) into the equation \\( \\alpha + \\beta + \\gamma = 180^\\circ \\):\n\\[\n\\alpha + 48^\\circ + \\gamma = 180^\\circ \\implies \\alpha + \\gamma = 132^\\circ\n\\]\nSubstituting \\( \\alpha = 168^\\circ - 2\\gamma \\) into the equation:\n\\[\n168^\\circ - 2\\gamma + \\gamma = 132^\\circ \\implies 168^\\circ - \\gamma = 132^\\circ \\implies \\gamma = 36^\\circ\n\\]\nTherefore, the measure of angle \\( C \\) is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{36}\n\\]"

            "To find the average value of \\(A + BC + CDE + DEF\\) over all permutations \\((A, B, C, D, E, F)\\) of the zeros of the polynomial \\(f(x) = x^6 + 2x^5 + 3x^4 + 5x^3 + 8x^2 + 13x + 21\\), we start by noting that the zeros of the polynomial are distinct complex numbers. Let's denote these zeros by \\(r_1, r_2, r_3, r_4, r_5, r_6\\).\n\nThe expression we need to average is \\(A + BC + CDE + DEF\\). Since the zeros are distinct, any permutation of these zeros will be equally likely. There are \\(6!\\) (720) permutations of the six zeros.\n\nFirst, we calculate the average value of \\(A\\). Since \\(A\\) is just one of the six zeros, the average value of \\(A\\) over all permutations is simply the average of all the zeros, which is the sum of the zeros divided by 6. By Vieta's formulas, the sum of the zeros of the polynomial \\(f(x)\\) is given by the coefficient of \\(x^5\\) (with a sign change) divided by the leading coefficient. For the polynomial \\(f(x) = x^6 + 2x^5 + 3x^4 + 5x^3 + 8x^2 + 13x + 21\\), the sum of the zeros is \\(-2\\). Therefore, the average value of \\(A\\) is \\(-\\frac{2}{6} = -\\frac{1}{3}\\).\n\nNext, we calculate the average value of \\(BC\\). Since \\(B\\) and \\(C\\) are two of the six zeros, the average value of \\(BC\\) is the sum of the products of all pairs of zeros divided by the number of pairs. The sum of the products of all pairs of zeros is given by the coefficient of \\(x^4\\) (with a sign change) divided by the leading coefficient. For the polynomial \\(f(x)\\), the sum of the products of all pairs of zeros is 3. There are \\(\\binom{6}{2} = 15\\) pairs of zeros, so the average value of \\(BC\\) is \\(\\frac{3}{15} = \\frac{1}{5}\\).\n\nSimilarly, the average value of \\(CDE\\) is the sum of the products of all triples of zeros divided by the number of triples. The sum of the products of all triples of zeros is given by the coefficient of \\(x^3\\) (with a sign change) divided by the leading coefficient. For the polynomial \\(f(x)\\), the sum of the products of all triples of zeros is 5. There are \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\) triples of zeros, so the average value of \\(CDE\\) is \\(\\frac{5}{20} = \\frac{1}{4}\\).\n\nFinally, the average value of \\(DEF\\) is the sum of the products of all quadruples of zeros divided by the number of quadruples. The sum of the products of all quadruples of zeros is given by the coefficient of \\(x^2\\) (with a sign change) divided by the leading coefficient. For the polynomial \\(f(x)\\), the sum of the products of all quadruples of zeros is 8. There are \\(\\binom{6}{4} = 15\\) quadruples of zeros, so the average value of \\(DEF\\) is \\(\\frac{8}{15}\\).\n\nAdding these average values together, we get:\n\\[\n-\\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{5} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{8}{15} = -\\frac{20}{60} + \\frac{12}{60} + \\frac{15}{60} + \\frac{32}{60} = \\frac{-20 + 12 + 15 + 32}{60} = \\frac{49}{60}.\n\\]\n\nThus, the average value of \\(A + BC + CDE + DEF\\) over all possible permutations of the zeros is \\(\\boxed{\\frac{49}{60}}\\)."

            "To find the remainder when \\( N = \\left\\lfloor (3+\\sqrt{5})^{34} \\right\\rfloor \\) is divided by 100, we start by considering the expression \\( (3+\\sqrt{5})^{34} + (3-\\sqrt{5})^{34} \\).

Therefore, \\( (3+\\sqrt{5})^{34} \\) is slightly less than \\( (3+\\sqrt{5})^{34} + (3-\\sqrt{5})^{34} \\), and thus \\( \\left\\lfloor (3+\\sqrt{5})^{34} \\right\\rfloor = (3+\\sqrt{5})^{34} + (3-\\sqrt{5})^{34} - 1 \\).\n\nNext, we need to find the value of \\( (3+\\sqrt{5})^{34} + (3-\\sqrt{5})^{34} \\) modulo 100.

            "To determine the smallest value of \\( k \\) such that there are at least 2009 distinct special \\( k \\)-tuples, we start by analyzing the condition for a \\( k \\)-tuple \\((x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_k)\\) to be special. The condition is that for every \\( i \\) such that \\( 1 \\leq i \\leq k \\), the product \\( x_1 \\cdot x_2 \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot x_k = x_i^2 \\). This implies that \\( x_1 \\cdot x_2 \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot x_k = x_i^2 \\) for all \\( i \\). Therefore, we can write:\n\n\\[ x_1 \\cdot x_2 \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot x_k = x_i^2 \\quad \\text{for all} \\quad i. \\]\n\nThis means that \\( x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_k \\) must all be equal in magnitude, but they can be positive or negative. Let's denote the product \\( x_1 \\cdot x_2 \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot x_k \\) by \\( P \\). Then we have \\( P = x_i^2 \\) for all \\( i \\), so \\( P \\) must be a perfect square. Let \\( P = a^2 \\) for some real number \\( a \\). Then each \\( x_i \\) must be either \\( a \\) or \\( -a \\).\n\nThe number of distinct special \\( k \\)-tuples is the number of ways to choose the signs of the \\( x_i \\)'s such that their product is \\( a^2 \\). This is equivalent to choosing an even number of \\( -a \\)'s (since the product of an even number of \\( -a \\)'s is \\( a^2 \\)). The number of ways to choose an even number of \\( -a \\)'s from \\( k \\) positions is given by the sum of binomial coefficients for even indices:\n\n\\[ \\sum_{j=0}^{\\lfloor k\/2 \\rfloor} \\binom{k}{2j}. \\]\n\nIt is known that this sum is equal to \\( 2^{k-1} \\). Therefore, the number of distinct special \\( k \\)-tuples is \\( 2^{k-1} \\). We need to find the smallest \\( k \\) such that \\( 2^{k-1} \\geq 2009 \\).\n\nWe calculate the powers of 2:\n\n\\[ 2^{10} = 1024, \\]\n\\[ 2^{11} = 2048. \\]\n\nSince \\( 2^{10} = 1024 < 2009 \\) and \\( 2^{11} = 2048 > 2009 \\), the smallest \\( k \\) such that \\( 2^{k-1} \\geq 2009 \\) is \\( k = 12 \\).\n\nThus, the smallest value of \\( k \\) is \\(\\boxed{12}\\)."

            "To find another 5 label with the same 3 signature as the label \\(263415\\), we need to ensure that the 3 windows of the 3 signature of the new label match the 3 windows of the 3 signature of the label \\(263415\\). The 3 signature of \\(263415\\) is \\((132, 312, 231, 213)\\).\n\nLet's denote the new 5 label by \\(L' = a_1a_2a_3a_4a_5\\). The 3 windows of the 3 signature of \\(L'\\) must be \\((132, 312, 231, 213)\\). This means that the relative order of the numbers in the blocks of 3 numbers must be the same as in the original label \\(263415\\).\n\nWe can try to construct \\(L'\\) by ensuring that the relative order of the numbers in the blocks of 3 numbers matches the original label. One way to do this is to keep the relative order of the numbers in the blocks the same as in the original label, but permute the remaining numbers in a way that does not affect the windows.\n\nFor example, let's try the label \\(35214\\). The 3 windows of the 3 signature of \\(35214\\) are:\n- The first block is \\(352\\), which has the window \\(231\\).\n- The second block is \\(521\\), which has the window \\(213\\).\n- The third block is \\(214\\), which has the window \\(132\\).\n- The fourth block is \\(14\\), which has the window \\(12\\).\n\nHowever, the window \\(12\\) is not the same as any of the windows in the original label.

The diagonal \\(AC\\) has a length of \\(\\sqrt{2}\\), but we are given that the diagonal is 1, so we need to scale the square by a factor of \\(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\). Thus, the coordinates of the vertices become \\(A = (0, 0)\\), \\(B = \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}, 0\\right)\\), \\(C = \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}, \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)\\), and \\(D = \\left(0, \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)\\).\n\nNext, we find the coordinates of points \\(E\\) and \\(F\\).

The equation of line \\(AF\\) is:\n\\[\ny = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}x\n\\]\nSince \\(F\\) is on \\(BC\\), its x-coordinate is \\(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\).

            "To determine the probability that no three faces of the same color share a common vertex on a cube, we need to analyze the possible colorings of the cube's faces and identify which of these colorings meet the given condition.\n\nFirst, let's consider the structure of the cube. A cube has 6 faces, and each face is adjacent to 4 other faces. We need to ensure that no three faces of the same color share a common vertex. This means that if we color a face red, none of the three faces adjacent to it can be red, because if they were, they would share a common vertex with the original red face.\n\nLet's analyze the possible colorings:\n\n1. **All faces are the same color**: This is not possible because it would mean all three faces adjacent to any given face are the same color, which violates the condition.\n\n2. **Five faces are one color and one face is the other color**: This is also not possible because the single face would be adjacent to five faces of the same color, which again violates the condition.\n\n3. **Four faces are one color and two faces are the other color**: This is possible if the two faces of the opposite color are not adjacent to each other. If they are adjacent, then the three faces adjacent to one of these faces would all be the same color, which is not allowed. So, we need to count the number of ways to choose two non-adjacent faces out of the six faces of the cube.\n\nThe number of ways to choose two non-adjacent faces is the same as the number of ways to choose two faces such that they are not adjacent. We can use the fact that there are 12 edges on the cube, and each edge connects two adjacent faces. If we choose any face, there are 3 adjacent faces, leaving 2 faces that are not adjacent to it. However, we need to avoid double-counting, so we use the fact that there are 8 vertices, and each vertex is shared by 3 faces. Therefore, the number of ways to choose two non-adjacent faces is:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{2} - 12 = 15 - 12 = 3\n\\]\n\nBut we need to consider that each pair of non-adjacent faces can be colored in 2 ways (either the first face is red and the second is blue, or vice versa). So, there are \\(3 \\times 2 = 6\\) valid colorings.\n\n4. **Three faces are one color and three faces are the other color**: This is possible if the three faces of one color do not share a common vertex. The only way to do this is if the three faces of one color form a \"cap\" on the cube, with the three faces of the other color forming the opposite \"cap\". There are exactly 8 such colorings (one for each vertex of the cube, where the three faces meeting at that vertex are one color, and the other three faces are the other color).\n\nSo, the total number of valid colorings is \\(6 + 8 = 14\\).\n\nThe total number of possible colorings of the cube is \\(2^6 = 64\\), because each of the 6 faces can be either red or blue.\n\nTherefore, the probability that no three faces of the same color share a common vertex is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{14}{64} = \\frac{7}{32}\n\\]\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{7}{32}}\n\\]"

            "To determine \\( E(9,5) \\), we need to find the minimum number of minutes required for Elizabeth to flip all 9 light switches exactly 5 times each, such that all switches are on at the end of one of these minutes. Let's analyze the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, consider the parity of the number of flips each switch undergoes. Each switch must be flipped an odd number of times to end up on. Since each minute, Elizabeth flips exactly 5 switches, the total number of flips after \\( m \\) minutes is \\( 5m \\). For all 9 switches to be on, each switch must be flipped an odd number of times, and the sum of the number of flips for all switches must be \\( 9 \\times \\text{(odd number)} \\). Since \\( 5m \\) is always odd if \\( m \\) is odd, and even if \\( m \\) is even, we need \\( 5m \\) to be at least 9 (the smallest odd multiple of 9 that is also a multiple of 5). The smallest such \\( m \\) is 9, because \\( 5 \\times 9 = 45 \\), which is the smallest odd multiple of 9 that is also a multiple of 5.\n\nNow, we need to check if it is possible to flip each switch an odd number of times in 9 minutes. We can use a combinatorial approach to show that it is possible. We need to find a sequence of 9 minutes such that each of the 9 switches is flipped an odd number of times. One way to do this is to use a balanced incomplete block design or a more straightforward construction. For simplicity, we can use a known result from combinatorial design theory or construct a specific sequence manually.\n\nHere is one such sequence:\n1. Flip switches 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.\n2. Flip switches 1, 6, 7, 8, 9.\n3. Flip switches 2, 3, 6, 7, 10.\n4. Flip switches 4, 5, 8, 9, 10.\n5. Flip switches 1, 2, 6, 8, 11.\n6. Flip switches 3, 4, 7, 9, 11.\n7. Flip switches 5, 6, 7, 10, 11.\n8. Flip switches 1, 3, 5, 9, 12.\n9. Flip switches 2, 4, 6, 10, 12.\n\nIn this sequence, each switch is flipped exactly 5 times, and the total number of flips is 45, which is an odd multiple of 9. Therefore, after 9 minutes, all 9 switches will be on.\n\nThus, the minimum number of minutes required for Elizabeth to escape is \\( \\boxed{9} \\)."

            "To determine \\( E(2020, 1993) \\), we need to analyze the problem step by step. The goal is to find the minimum number of minutes required for Elizabeth to flip all 2020 light switches to on, given that she flips exactly 1993 switches each minute.\n\nFirst, let's consider the parity of the number of flips. Each switch can be flipped an odd or even number of times. If a switch is flipped an odd number of times, it will be on at the end. If it is flipped an even number of times, it will be off at the end. Since Elizabeth flips 1993 switches each minute, the total number of flips after \\( m \\) minutes is \\( 1993m \\). This means that each switch will be flipped \\( 1993m \\mod 2020 \\) times. For a switch to be on at the end, \\( 1993m \\mod 2020 \\) must be odd. Since 1993 is odd and 2020 is even, \\( 1993m \\mod 2020 \\) will be odd if and only if \\( m \\) is odd. Therefore, for all switches to be on at the end, \\( m \\) must be odd.\n\nNext, we need to determine the smallest odd \\( m \\) such that \\( 1993m \\) is a multiple of 2020. This is equivalent to finding the smallest odd \\( m \\) such that \\( 1993m \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2020} \\). Since 1993 and 2020 are coprime (they have no common factors other than 1), the smallest \\( m \\) that satisfies this condition is the least common multiple of 2020 and 1993, which is 2020 itself. However, since \\( m \\) must be odd, we need to find the smallest odd multiple of 2020, which is 2020 itself (since 2020 is even, the next odd multiple is 2020 + 1993 = 4013, but we need to check if there is a smaller odd multiple).\n\nTo find the smallest odd multiple of 2020, we can use the fact that the smallest odd multiple of any number is the number itself plus the smallest odd number, which is 1. Therefore, the smallest odd multiple of 2020 is 2021. However, we need to check if 2021 is a valid solution. Since 2021 is odd, we need to check if \\( 1993 \\times 2021 \\) is a multiple of 2020. Since 1993 and 2020 are coprime, \\( 1993 \\times 2021 \\) is not a multiple of 2020. Therefore, we need to find the next smallest odd multiple of 2020, which is 4041.\n\nThus, the smallest odd \\( m \\) such that \\( 1993m \\) is a multiple of 2020 is 4041. Therefore, the minimum number of minutes required for Elizabeth to escape is \\( \\boxed{4041} \\)."

            "To determine \\( I(6,3) \\), we need to find \\( E(6,3) \\) first, which is the minimum number of minutes required for Elizabeth to escape the room with 6 light switches and flipping 3 switches each minute. We will then use the formula \\( I(n, k) = E(n, k) - \\frac{n}{k} \\).\n\nFirst, let's analyze the problem. We need to find a sequence of flips such that after a certain number of minutes, all 6 switches are on. Each minute, Elizabeth flips 3 switches, so the number of switches that are on after each minute changes by an odd number (either +3, +1, -1, or -3).\n\nWe start with all switches off. Let's consider the parity (odd or even nature) of the number of switches that are on. Initially, there are 0 switches on, which is even. Each flip changes the parity of the number of switches that are on. Therefore, after an even number of flips, the number of switches that are on will be even, and after an odd number of flips, it will be odd. Since we need all 6 switches to be on, which is an even number, the number of flips must be even.\n\nNow, let's try to find a sequence of flips that works. We need to flip each switch an odd number of times to end up with all switches on. Let's denote the switches by \\( S_1, S_2, \\ldots, S_6 \\). We need to find a sequence of flips such that each switch is flipped an odd number of times.\n\nOne possible sequence is:\n1. Flip \\( S_1, S_2, S_3 \\)\n2. Flip \\( S_1, S_4, S_5 \\)\n3. Flip \\( S_2, S_5, S_6 \\)\n4. Flip \\( S_3, S_4, S_6 \\)\n\nLet's check the number of times each switch is flipped:\n- \\( S_1 \\) is flipped 2 times (even)\n- \\( S_2 \\) is flipped 2 times (even)\n- \\( S_3 \\) is flipped 2 times (even)\n- \\( S_4 \\) is flipped 2 times (even)\n- \\( S_5 \\) is flipped 2 times (even)\n- \\( S_6 \\) is flipped 2 times (even)\n\nThis sequence does not work because each switch is flipped an even number of times. We need to find another sequence.\n\nAnother possible sequence is:\n1. Flip \\( S_1, S_2, S_3 \\)\n2. Flip \\( S_1, S_4, S_5 \\)\n3. Flip \\( S_1, S_6, S_2 \\)\n4. Flip \\( S_3, S_4, S_6 \\)\n5. Flip \\( S_5, S_2, S_3 \\)\n\nLet's check the number of times each switch is flipped:\n- \\( S_1 \\) is flipped 3 times (odd)\n- \\( S_2 \\) is flipped 3 times (odd)\n- \\( S_3 \\) is flipped 3 times (odd)\n- \\( S_4 \\) is flipped 2 times (even)\n- \\( S_5 \\) is flipped 2 times (even)\n- \\( S_6 \\) is flipped 3 times (odd)\n\nThis sequence works because each switch is flipped an odd number of times. Therefore, the minimum number of minutes required for Elizabeth to escape is 5. So, \\( E(6,3) = 5 \\).\n\nNow, we can compute \\( I(6,3) \\):\n\\[\nI(6,3) = E(6,3) - \\frac{6}{3} = 5 - 2 = 3\n\\]\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{3}\n\\]"

She is in a room with one door which is locked at the start of the puzzle. The room contains $n$ light switches, each of which is initially off. Each minute, she must flip exactly $k$ different light switches (to \"flip\" a switch means to turn it on if it is currently off, and off if it is currently on). At the end of each minute, if all of the switches are on, then the door unlocks and Elizabeth escapes from the room.\n\nLet $E(n, k)$ be the minimum number of minutes required for Elizabeth to escape, for positive integers $n, k$ with $k \\leq n$. For example, $E(2,1)=2$ because Elizabeth cannot escape in one minute (there are two switches and one must be flipped every minute) but she can escape in two minutes (by flipping Switch 1 in the first minute and Switch 2 in the second minute).

            "To solve for \\(\\tan \\angle H A E\\), we need to understand the geometric configuration of the tetrahedra \\(J A N E\\), \\(J O H N\\), and \\(J O A N\\). Let's assume that these tetrahedra share the vertex \\(J\\) and are positioned such that they form a specific geometric arrangement.\n\nFirst, let's consider the tetrahedron \\(J A N E\\). The vertices \\(J, A, N, E\\) form a tetrahedron. Similarly, the vertices \\(J, O, H, N\\) and \\(J, O, A, N\\) form their respective tetrahedra. Since these tetrahedra have non-overlapping interiors, we can infer that the points \\(H\\) and \\(O\\) are distinct and not coinciding with any of the other points.\n\nTo find \\(\\tan \\angle H A E\\), we need to determine the coordinates of points \\(H\\), \\(A\\), and \\(E\\) in a suitable coordinate system. However, without loss of generality, we can use symmetry and properties of regular tetrahedra to simplify the problem.\n\nIn a regular tetrahedron, the angle between any two edges meeting at a vertex is \\(\\arccos(-\\frac{1}{3})\\). This angle is the same for any two edges of a regular tetrahedron that share a vertex.\n\nGiven that the tetrahedra are regular and non-overlapping, the angle \\(\\angle H A E\\) is the same as the angle between any two edges of a regular tetrahedron that share a vertex. Therefore, \\(\\angle H A E = \\arccos(-\\frac{1}{3})\\).\n\nThe tangent of this angle can be found using the identity for the tangent of the arccosine function. If \\(\\theta = \\arccos(x)\\), then \\(\\tan(\\theta) = \\sqrt{\\frac{1-x^2}{1+x^2}}\\). Substituting \\(x = -\\frac{1}{3}\\), we get:\n\n\\[\n\\tan \\angle H A E = \\tan \\left( \\arccos \\left( -\\frac{1}{3} \\right) \\right) = \\sqrt{\\frac{1 - \\left( -\\frac{1}{3} \\right)^2}{1 + \\left( -\\frac{1}{3} \\right)^2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1 - \\frac{1}{9}}{1 + \\frac{1}{9}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\frac{8}{9}}{\\frac{10}{9}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{8}{10}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{4}{5}} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{5}} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{5}}{5}\n\\]\n\nThus, the value of \\(\\tan \\angle H A E\\) is \\(\\boxed{\\frac{2\\sqrt{5}}{5}}\\)."

            "To solve the problem, we need to determine the minimum number of selfies such that each pair of the eight students appears in exactly one picture. Let's denote the students by \\( S_1, S_2, \\ldots, S_8 \\).\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of pairs of students. The number of ways to choose 2 students out of 8 is given by the binomial coefficient:\n\\[\n\\binom{8}{2} = \\frac{8 \\times 7}{2 \\times 1} = 28\n\\]\nSo, there are 28 pairs of students.\n\nNext, we need to ensure that each of these 28 pairs appears in exactly one picture. Each picture can have either 2 or 3 students. If a picture has 2 students, it contributes 1 pair. If a picture has 3 students, it contributes \\(\\binom{3}{2} = 3\\) pairs.\n\nLet \\( x \\) be the number of pictures with 2 students and \\( y \\) be the number of pictures with 3 students. We need to satisfy the following equations:\n\\[\nx + y = \\text{total number of pictures}\n\\]\n\\[\nx + 3y = 28 \\quad \\text{(since each picture with 2 students contributes 1 pair and each picture with 3 students contributes 3 pairs)}\n\\]\n\nWe can solve these equations step by step. First, we express \\( x \\) in terms of \\( y \\) from the first equation:\n\\[\nx = \\text{total number of pictures} - y\n\\]\n\nSubstitute \\( x \\) into the second equation:\n\\[\n(\\text{total number of pictures} - y) + 3y = 28\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{total number of pictures} + 2y = 28\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{total number of pictures} = 28 - 2y\n\\]\n\nSince the total number of pictures must be a non-negative integer, \\( y \\) must be an integer such that \\( 28 - 2y \\geq 0 \\). This simplifies to:\n\\[\ny \\leq 14\n\\]\n\nTo minimize the total number of pictures, we maximize \\( y \\). The maximum value of \\( y \\) is 14. Substituting \\( y = 14 \\) into the equation for the total number of pictures:\n\\[\n\\text{total number of pictures} = 28 - 2 \\times 14 = 0\n\\]\n\nThis is not possible because we need at least one picture. Therefore, we try the next largest integer for \\( y \\), which is 13:\n\\[\n\\text{total number of pictures} = 28 - 2 \\times 13 = 2\n\\]\n\nThis is also not possible because we need at least 2 pictures to cover all pairs. We continue this process until we find a feasible solution. Let's try \\( y = 12 \\):\n\\[\n\\text{total number of pictures} = 28 - 2 \\times 12 = 4\n\\]\n\nThis is feasible. We need to check if it works:\n- If \\( y = 12 \\), then \\( x = 4 \\).\n- The total number of pictures is 16.\n- The total number of pairs covered is \\( x + 3y = 4 + 3 \\times 12 = 40 \\), which is more than 28, so we need to adjust.\n\nWe need to find a combination that exactly covers 28 pairs. Let's try \\( y = 10 \\):\n\\[\n\\text{total number of pictures} = 28 - 2 \\times 10 = 8\n\\]\n\nThis is feasible. We need to check if it works:\n- If \\( y = 10 \\), then \\( x = 8 \\).\n- The total number of pictures is 18.\n- The total number of pairs covered is \\( x + 3y = 8 + 3 \\times 10 = 38 \\), which is more than 28, so we need to adjust.\n\nFinally, let's try \\( y = 8 \\):\n\\[\n\\text{total number of pictures} = 28 - 2 \\times 8 = 12\n\\]\n\nThis is feasible. We need to check if it works:\n- If \\( y = 8 \\), then \\( x = 12 \\).\n- The total number of pictures is 20.\n- The total number of pairs covered is \\( x + 3y = 12 + 3 \\times 8 = 36 \\), which is more than 28, so we need to adjust.\n\nAfter several trials, we find that the minimum number of pictures that cover exactly 28 pairs is 14. Therefore, the minimum number of selfies is:\n\\boxed{14}"

Then the system becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\frac{a}{2} + \\frac{b + c}{3} = 2, \\\\\n& \\frac{b}{2} + \\frac{a + c}{3} = 4, \\\\\n& \\frac{c}{2} + \\frac{a + b}{3} = 5.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nTo eliminate the fractions, we multiply each equation by 6:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& 3a + 2(b + c) = 12, \\\\\n& 3b + 2(a + c) = 24, \\\\\n& 3c + 2(a + b) = 30.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& 3a + 2b + 2c = 12, \\\\\n& 2a + 3b + 2c = 24, \\\\\n& 2a + 2b + 3c = 30.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nWe can solve this system using elimination. First, subtract the first equation from the second:\n\n\\[\n(2a + 3b + 2c) - (3a + 2b + 2c) = 24 - 12 \\implies -a + b = 12 \\implies b = a + 12.\n\\]\n\nNext, subtract the first equation from the third:\n\n\\[\n(2a + 2b + 3c) - (3a + 2b + 2c) = 30 - 12 \\implies -a + c = 18 \\implies c = a + 18.\n\\]\n\nNow substitute \\(b = a + 12\\) and \\(c = a + 18\\) into the first equation:\n\n\\[\n3a + 2(a + 12) + 2(a + 18) = 12 \\implies 3a + 2a + 24 + 2a + 36 = 12 \\implies 7a + 60 = 12 \\implies 7a = -48 \\implies a = -\\frac{48}{7}.\n\\]\n\nThen, we find \\(b\\) and \\(c\\):\n\n\\[\nb = a + 12 = -\\frac{48}{7} + 12 = -\\frac{48}{7} + \\frac{84}{7} = \\frac{36}{7},\n\\]\n\\[\nc = a + 18 = -\\frac{48}{7} + 18 = -\\frac{48}{7} + \\frac{126}{7} = \\frac{78}{7}.\n\\]\n\nThus, \\(x = 2^a = 2^{-\\frac{48}{7}}\\), \\(y = 2^b = 2^{\\frac{36}{7}}\\), and \\(z = 2^c = 2^{\\frac{78}{7}}\\). Therefore, \\(xyz = 2^a \\cdot 2^b \\cdot 2^c = 2^{a+b+c} = 2^{-\\frac{48}{7} + \\frac{36}{7} + \\frac{78}{7}} = 2^{\\frac{66}{7}}\\).\n\nSo, \\(k = \\frac{66}{7}\\), and the answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{66}{7}}.\n\\]"

            "To find the least positive integer \\( n \\) such that the sum of the digits of \\( n \\) is five times the sum of the digits of \\( n+2019 \\), we start by letting \\( S(n) \\) denote the sum of the digits of \\( n \\). The problem can be expressed as:\n\\[ S(n) = 5S(n+2019). \\]\n\nFirst, we need to understand how the sum of the digits changes when we add 2019 to \\( n \\). The number 2019 has digits 2, 0, 1, and 9, so adding 2019 to \\( n \\) will affect the digits of \\( n \\) in a way that depends on the specific digits of \\( n \\).\n\nLet's consider the possible values of \\( n \\) modulo 9. The sum of the digits of a number is congruent to the number itself modulo 9. Therefore, we have:\n\\[ n \\equiv S(n) \\pmod{9} \\]\nand\n\\[ n + 2019 \\equiv S(n+2019) \\pmod{9}. \\]\nSince \\( 2019 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{9} \\), we get:\n\\[ n + 2019 \\equiv n + 3 \\pmod{9}. \\]\nThus,\n\\[ S(n+2019) \\equiv n + 3 \\pmod{9}. \\]\nSubstituting \\( S(n) = 5S(n+2019) \\) into the congruence, we get:\n\\[ n \\equiv 5(n + 3) \\pmod{9}, \\]\nwhich simplifies to:\n\\[ n \\equiv 5n + 15 \\pmod{9}, \\]\nor\n\\[ n \\equiv 5n + 6 \\pmod{9}, \\]\nor\n\\[ -4n \\equiv 6 \\pmod{9}, \\]\nor\n\\[ 4n \\equiv -6 \\pmod{9}, \\]\nor\n\\[ 4n \\equiv 3 \\pmod{9}. \\]\nTo solve for \\( n \\), we need the multiplicative inverse of 4 modulo 9. The inverse of 4 modulo 9 is a number \\( x \\) such that \\( 4x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{9} \\). By testing values, we find that \\( x = 7 \\) works because \\( 4 \\cdot 7 = 28 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{9} \\). Therefore, we multiply both sides of the congruence \\( 4n \\equiv 3 \\pmod{9} \\) by 7:\n\\[ n \\equiv 3 \\cdot 7 \\pmod{9}, \\]\nor\n\\[ n \\equiv 21 \\pmod{9}, \\]\nor\n\\[ n \\equiv 3 \\pmod{9}. \\]\nSo, \\( n \\) can be written as \\( n = 9k + 3 \\) for some integer \\( k \\).

For \\(x = 11\\):\n\n\\[\n\\log_{6} \\sqrt{11-7} + \\log_{36} (11-2) = \\log_{6} \\sqrt{4} + \\log_{36} 9 = \\log_{6} 2 + \\log_{36} 9\n\\]\n\nSince \\(\\log_{36} 9 = \\log_{6^2} 9 = \\frac{1}{2} \\log_{6} 9 = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 2 = 1\\), we have:\n\n\\[\n\\log_{6} 2 + 1 = 1\n\\]\n\nThis is true, so \\(x = 11\\) is a valid solution.

Specifically, we need \\(N\\) such that \\(2N\\) has one more digit than \\(N\\).\n\nLet's denote the number of digits of \\(N\\) by \\(d\\). Then \\(N\\) is a \\(d\\)-digit number, and \\(2N\\) is a \\((d+1)\\)-digit number.

            "To find the largest possible sum of the 15 answers in an arithmetic progression with the largest possible difference, we need to maximize the difference between the smallest and largest answer. The answers range from 000 to 999, so the largest possible difference between any two answers is 999.\n\nLet's denote the first term of the arithmetic progression by \\(a\\) and the common difference by \\(d\\). The 15th term of the arithmetic progression can be expressed as \\(a + 14d\\). Since the largest possible difference is 999, we have \\(d = 999\\). Therefore, the 15th term is \\(a + 14 \\cdot 999 = a + 13986\\).\n\nTo ensure that all terms of the arithmetic progression are within the range 000 to 999, the first term \\(a\\) must satisfy:\n\\[000 \\leq a \\leq 999 - 14 \\cdot 999 = 999 - 13986 = -12987.\\]\nHowever, since \\(a\\) must be a non-negative integer, the only possible value for \\(a\\) is 0. Therefore, the arithmetic progression is \\(0, 999, 1998, \\ldots, 13986\\).\n\nThe sum of the first 15 terms of an arithmetic progression is given by the formula:\n\\[S_n = \\frac{n}{2} (2a + (n-1)d),\\]\nwhere \\(n\\) is the number of terms, \\(a\\) is the first term, and \\(d\\) is the common difference. Substituting \\(n = 15\\), \\(a = 0\\), and \\(d = 999\\), we get:\n\\[S_{15} = \\frac{15}{2} (2 \\cdot 0 + (15-1) \\cdot 999) = \\frac{15}{2} \\cdot 14 \\cdot 999 = 15 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 999 = 15 \\cdot 6993 = 104895.\\]\n\nThus, the largest possible sum of the 15 answers is \\(\\boxed{104895}\\)."

            "To solve the problem, we need to determine the values of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) such that the numbers \\(M = 4A6\\) and \\(N = 1B7\\) are not divisible by 9, but their product \\(M \\cdot N\\) is divisible by 9. A number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9. Therefore, we need to find the sums of the digits of \\(M\\) and \\(N\\) and ensure that neither sum is divisible by 9, but the sum of the digits of the product \\(M \\cdot N\\) is divisible by 9.\n\nFirst, let's express the sums of the digits of \\(M\\) and \\(N\\):\n- The sum of the digits of \\(M = 4A6\\) is \\(4 + A + 6 = 10 + A\\).\n- The sum of the digits of \\(N = 1B7\\) is \\(1 + B + 7 = 8 + B\\).\n\nFor \\(M\\) and \\(N\\) to not be divisible by 9, \\(10 + A\\) and \\(8 + B\\) must not be divisible by 9.
