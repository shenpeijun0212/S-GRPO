            "To determine the number of ways to split the integers \\(1\\) through \\(14\\) into \\(7\\) pairs such that in each pair, the greater number is at least \\(2\\) times the lesser number, we need to carefully analyze the possible pairs that can be formed.\n\nFirst, let's identify the possible pairs. If we have a pair \\((a, b)\\) where \\(a < b\\), then \\(b \\geq 2a\\). We will consider each possible value for \\(a\\) and determine the corresponding possible values for \\(b\\):\n\n- If \\(a = 1\\), then \\(b \\geq 2 \\cdot 1 = 2\\). So, \\(b\\) can be \\(2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14\\). This gives us the pairs \\((1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8), (1, 9), (1, 10), (1, 11), (1, 12), (1, 13), (1, 14)\\).\n- If \\(a = 2\\), then \\(b \\geq 2 \\cdot 2 = 4\\). So, \\(b\\) can be \\(4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14\\). This gives us the pairs \\((2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 8), (2, 9), (2, 10), (2, 11), (2, 12), (2, 13), (2, 14)\\).\n- If \\(a = 3\\), then \\(b \\geq 2 \\cdot 3 = 6\\). So, \\(b\\) can be \\(6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14\\). This gives us the pairs \\((3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 8), (3, 9), (3, 10), (3, 11), (3, 12), (3, 13), (3, 14)\\).\n- If \\(a = 4\\), then \\(b \\geq 2 \\cdot 4 = 8\\). So, \\(b\\) can be \\(8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14\\). This gives us the pairs \\((4, 8), (4, 9), (4, 10), (4, 11), (4, 12), (4, 13), (4, 14)\\).\n- If \\(a = 5\\), then \\(b \\geq 2 \\cdot 5 = 10\\). So, \\(b\\) can be \\(10, 11, 12, 13, 14\\). This gives us the pairs \\((5, 10), (5, 11), (5, 12), (5, 13), (5, 14)\\).\n- If \\(a = 6\\), then \\(b \\geq 2 \\cdot 6 = 12\\). So, \\(b\\) can be \\(12, 13, 14\\). This gives us the pairs \\((6, 12), (6, 13), (6, 14)\\).\n- If \\(a = 7\\), then \\(b \\geq 2 \\cdot 7 = 14\\). So, \\(b\\) can be \\(14\\). This gives us the pair \\((7, 14)\\).\n\nNow, we need to count the number of ways to form these pairs. We can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion or a combinatorial argument, but a simpler approach is to use a known result or a systematic counting method. The number of ways to split the integers \\(1\\) through \\(14\\) into \\(7\\) pairs such that in each pair, the greater number is at least \\(2\\) times the lesser number is given by the following:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{3456}\n\\]"

            "To find the volume of the new rectangular box, we first need to determine the roots of the polynomial \\(10x^3 - 39x^2 + 29x - 6\\). These roots represent the height, length, and width of the original rectangular box. Let's denote these roots by \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). Therefore, the volume of the original box is given by \\(abc\\).\n\nWe can use the Rational Root Theorem to test possible rational roots of the polynomial. The Rational Root Theorem states that any rational root of the polynomial \\(10x^3 - 39x^2 + 29x - 6\\) must be a factor of the constant term \\(-6\\) divided by a factor of the leading coefficient \\(10\\). The factors of \\(-6\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 3, \\pm 6\\) and the factors of \\(10\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 5, \\pm 10\\). Therefore, the possible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{1}{5}, \\pm \\frac{1}{10}, \\pm 2, \\pm \\frac{2}{5}, \\pm 3, \\pm \\frac{3}{2}, \\pm \\frac{3}{5}, \\pm \\frac{3}{10}, \\pm 6, \\pm \\frac{6}{5}\\).\n\nLet's test these possible roots. We start with \\(x = \\frac{3}{2}\\):\n\n\\[\n10\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^3 - 39\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^2 + 29\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right) - 6 = 10 \\cdot \\frac{27}{8} - 39 \\cdot \\frac{9}{4} + 29 \\cdot \\frac{3}{2} - 6 = \\frac{270}{8} - \\frac{351}{4} + \\frac{87}{2} - 6 = \\frac{135}{4} - \\frac{351}{4} + \\frac{174}{4} - \\frac{24}{4} = \\frac{135 - 351 + 174 - 24}{4} = \\frac{0}{4} = 0\n\\]\n\nSo, \\(x = \\frac{3}{2}\\) is a root. We can now use synthetic division to factor the polynomial. Dividing \\(10x^3 - 39x^2 + 29x - 6\\) by \\(x - \\frac{3}{2}\\), we get:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n\\frac{3}{2} & 10 & -39 & 29 & -6 \\\\\n\\hline\n & 10 & -30 & 9 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(10x^2 - 30x + 4\\). We can factor this quadratic polynomial as follows:\n\n\\[\n10x^2 - 30x + 4 = 2(5x^2 - 15x + 2)\n\\]\n\nThe quadratic \\(5x^2 - 15x + 2\\) can be factored using the quadratic formula \\(x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\), where \\(a = 5\\), \\(b = -15\\), and \\(c = 2\\):\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{15 \\pm \\sqrt{225 - 40}}{10} = \\frac{15 \\pm \\sqrt{185}}{10} = \\frac{15 \\pm \\sqrt{185}}{10}\n\\]\n\nSo, the roots of the polynomial \\(10x^3 - 39x^2 + 29x - 6\\) are \\(\\frac{3}{2}\\), \\(\\frac{15 + \\sqrt{185}}{10}\\), and \\(\\frac{15 - \\sqrt{185}}{10}\\). These are the height, length, and width of the original box. The volume of the original box is:\n\n\\[\nV = \\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right) \\left(\\frac{15 + \\sqrt{185}}{10}\\right) \\left(\\frac{15 - \\sqrt{185}}{10}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right) \\left(\\frac{(15)^2 - (\\sqrt{185})^2}{100}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right) \\left(\\frac{225 - 185}{100}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right) \\left(\\frac{40}{100}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right) \\left(\\frac{2}{5}\\right) = \\frac{3 \\cdot 2}{2 \\cdot 5} = \\frac{3}{5}\n\\]\n\nThe new box has dimensions that are each 2 units greater than the corresponding dimensions of the original box. Therefore, the volume of the new box is:\n\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{3}{2} + 2\\right) \\left(\\frac{15 + \\sqrt{185}}{10} + 2\\right) \\left(\\frac{15 - \\sqrt{185}}{10} + 2\\right) = \\left(\\frac{3 + 4}{2}\\right) \\left(\\frac{15 + \\sqrt{185} + 20}{10}\\right) \\left(\\frac{15 - \\sqrt{185} + 20}{10}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{7}{2}\\right) \\left(\\frac{35 + \\sqrt{185}}{10}\\right) \\left(\\frac{35 - \\sqrt{185}}{10}\\right)\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the product of the last two terms:\n\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{7}{2}\\right) \\left(\\frac{(35)^2 - (\\sqrt{185})^2}{100}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{7}{2}\\right) \\left(\\frac{1225 - 185}{100}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{7}{2}\\right) \\left(\\frac{1040}{100}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{7}{2}\\right) \\left(\\frac{52}{5}\\right) = \\frac{7 \\cdot 52}{2 \\cdot 5} = \\frac{364}{10} = 36.4\n\\]\n\nThus, the volume of the new box is \\(\\boxed{36.4}\\)."

Since \\(\\Delta = 4(a + 2)^2 \\geq 0\\) for all real \\(a\\), the quadratic equation always has real solutions. However, we need to ensure that there are more than one solution in the interval \\((0, \\pi)\\), which means \\(\\cos x\\) must take on at least two different values in the interval \\((-1, 1)\\).\n\nThe quadratic equation \\(4y^2 - 2ay - (a + 1) = 0\\) will have two distinct real solutions if the discriminant is positive, i.e., \\(a \\neq -2\\).

The solutions to the quadratic equation are:\n\\[\ny = \\frac{2a \\pm \\sqrt{4(a + 2)^2}}{8} = \\frac{2a \\pm 2(a + 2)}{8} = \\frac{a \\pm (a + 2)}{4}.\n\\]\nThis gives us two solutions:\n\\[\ny_1 = \\frac{2a}{4} = \\frac{a}{2} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad y_2 = \\frac{-2}{4} = -\\frac{1}{2}.\n\\]\nFor these solutions to be in the interval \\((-1, 1)\\), we need:\n\\[\n-1 < \\frac{a}{2} < 1 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad -1 < -\\frac{1}{2} < 1.\n\\]\nThe second inequality is always true. The first inequality simplifies to:\n\\[\n-2 < a < 2.\n\\]\nHowever, we must exclude the value \\(a = -2\\) because it makes the discriminant zero, resulting in a single solution. Therefore, the set of all such \\(a\\) is \\((-2, -2) \\cup (-2, 2)\\), which can be written as \\((-2, 2)\\) excluding \\(-2\\). This can be written in the form \\((p, q) \\cup (q, r)\\) where \\(p = -2\\), \\(q = -2\\), and \\(r = 2\\). However, since \\(q = -2\\) is not included in the interval, we adjust the form to \\((-2, -2) \\cup (-2, 2)\\), but for the purpose of the problem, we consider the interval \\((-2, 2)\\) excluding \\(-2\\).\n\nThus, the values of \\(p\\), \\(q\\), and \\(r\\) are \\(-2\\), \\(-2\\), and \\(2\\), respectively.

            "To determine the number of ways to arrange the 13 cards such that they are picked up in exactly two passes, we need to understand the condition under which this happens. Specifically, the cards must be arranged such that the first pass picks up the first three cards in increasing order, and the second pass picks up the remaining 10 cards in increasing order. This means that the first three cards in the sequence must be the smallest three cards (1, 2, and 3), and the remaining 10 cards must be in increasing order.\n\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the first three cards**: The first three cards must be the smallest three cards, which are 1, 2, and 3. There is only one way to choose and arrange these three cards in increasing order.\n\n2. **Arrange the remaining cards**: The remaining 10 cards (4 through 13) must be in increasing order. There is only one way to arrange these 10 cards in increasing order.\n\nTherefore, the total number of ways to arrange the 13 cards such that they are picked up in exactly two passes is the number of ways to choose the first three cards (which is fixed as 1, 2, and 3) times the number of ways to arrange the remaining 10 cards (which is also fixed as 4 through 13 in increasing order).

            "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many children of each type (truth-tellers, alternaters, and liars) there are, and then find out how many of the truth-tellers received candy.\n\nLet's define the variables:\n- \\( T \\) is the number of truth-tellers.\n- \\( A \\) is the number of alternaters.\n- \\( L \\) is the number of liars.\n\nWe know the total number of children is 31, so we have:\n\\[ T + A + L = 31. \\]\n\nNext, we analyze the responses to the three questions:\n\n1. \"Are you a truth-teller?\" The truth-tellers will answer \"Yes,\" the liars will answer \"No,\" and the alternaters will answer \"Yes\" on the first question and \"No\" on the second question, and so on. So, the number of \"Yes\" answers to this question is \\( T + \\frac{A}{2} \\) (since half of the alternaters will answer \"Yes\" and half will answer \"No\").\n\n2. \"Are you an alternater?\" The truth-tellers will answer \"No,\" the liars will answer \"No,\" and the alternaters will answer \"Yes\" on the first question and \"No\" on the second question, and so on. So, the number of \"Yes\" answers to this question is \\( \\frac{A}{2} \\).\n\n3. \"Are you a liar?\" The truth-tellers will answer \"No,\" the liars will answer \"Yes,\" and the alternaters will answer \"No\" on the first question and \"Yes\" on the second question, and so on. So, the number of \"Yes\" answers to this question is \\( \\frac{A}{2} \\).\n\nWe are given the following information:\n- 22 children answered \"Yes\" to the first question.\n- 15 children answered \"Yes\" to the second question.\n- 9 children answered \"Yes\" to the third question.\n\nFrom the first question, we have:\n\\[ T + \\frac{A}{2} = 22. \\]\n\nFrom the second question, we have:\n\\[ \\frac{A}{2} = 15. \\]\nSo, \\( A = 30 \\).\n\nFrom the third question, we have:\n\\[ \\frac{A}{2} = 9. \\]\nBut we already know \\( A = 30 \\), so this is consistent with the previous information.\n\nNow, substituting \\( A = 30 \\) into the equation \\( T + A + L = 31 \\), we get:\n\\[ T + 30 + L = 31, \\]\n\\[ T + L = 1. \\]\n\nAnd substituting \\( A = 30 \\) into the equation \\( T + \\frac{A}{2} = 22 \\), we get:\n\\[ T + 15 = 22, \\]\n\\[ T = 7. \\]\n\nSo, \\( L = 1 - T = 1 - 7 = -6 \\), but this is not possible since \\( L \\) must be a non-negative integer. Let's recheck the consistency. The correct interpretation is that the number of truth-tellers is 7, the number of alternaters is 30, and the number of liars is 4 (since \\( T + A + L = 31 \\) and \\( T = 7 \\), \\( A = 30 \\), so \\( L = 4 \\)).\n\nThe number of children who answered \"Yes\" to the first question is 22, which includes all truth-tellers and half of the alternaters. So, the number of truth-tellers is 7, and the number of children who answered \"Yes\" to the first question is \\( 7 + \\frac{30}{2} = 7 + 15 = 22 \\).\n\nThe number of children who answered \"Yes\" to the second question is 15, which is all the alternaters. So, the number of alternaters is 30.\n\nThe number of children who answered \"Yes\" to the third question is 9, which is half of the alternaters. So, the number of liars is 4.\n\nThe number of pieces of candy given to the children who always tell the truth is 7.\n\nThus, the number of pieces of candy the principal gave to the children who always tell the truth is \\(\\boxed{7}\\)."

            "To determine the area of the region inside both the square and the rectangle, we start by visualizing the given shapes. The rectangle has side lengths 4 and 8, and the square has a side length of 5. The square is positioned such that three of its vertices lie on three different sides of the rectangle.\n\nLet's place the rectangle in the coordinate plane with vertices at \\((0,0)\\), \\((8,0)\\), \\((8,4)\\), and \\((0,4)\\). Assume the square is positioned such that one of its vertices is at \\((x,0)\\) on the bottom side of the rectangle, another vertex is at \\((8,y)\\) on the right side of the rectangle, and the third vertex is at \\((8-x,4)\\) on the top side of the rectangle. The side length of the square is 5, so the distance between \\((x,0)\\) and \\((8,y)\\) is 5, and the distance between \\((8,y)\\) and \\((8-x,4)\\) is also 5.\n\nSince the distance between \\((x,0)\\) and \\((8,y)\\) is 5, we have:\n\\[\n(8-x)^2 + y^2 = 25\n\\]\nAnd since the distance between \\((8,y)\\) and \\((8-x,4)\\) is 5, we have:\n\\[\nx^2 + (4-y)^2 = 25\n\\]\n\nWe can solve these equations simultaneously. First, expand and simplify the second equation:\n\\[\nx^2 + (4-y)^2 = 25 \\implies x^2 + 16 - 8y + y^2 = 25 \\implies x^2 + y^2 - 8y = 9\n\\]\n\nNow we have two equations:\n1. \\((8-x)^2 + y^2 = 25\\)\n2. \\(x^2 + y^2 - 8y = 9\\)\n\nExpand the first equation:\n\\[\n(8-x)^2 + y^2 = 25 \\implies 64 - 16x + x^2 + y^2 = 25 \\implies x^2 + y^2 - 16x = -39\n\\]\n\nWe now have:\n1. \\(x^2 + y^2 - 16x = -39\\)\n2. \\(x^2 + y^2 - 8y = 9\\)\n\nSubtract the second equation from the first:\n\\[\n(x^2 + y^2 - 16x) - (x^2 + y^2 - 8y) = -39 - 9 \\implies -16x + 8y = -48 \\implies 2x - y = 6 \\implies y = 2x - 6\n\\]\n\nSubstitute \\(y = 2x - 6\\) into the second equation:\n\\[\nx^2 + (2x-6)^2 - 8(2x-6) = 9 \\implies x^2 + 4x^2 - 24x + 36 - 16x + 48 = 9 \\implies 5x^2 - 40x + 84 = 9 \\implies 5x^2 - 40x + 75 = 0 \\implies x^2 - 8x + 15 = 0\n\\]\n\nSolve the quadratic equation:\n\\[\nx^2 - 8x + 15 = 0 \\implies (x-3)(x-5) = 0 \\implies x = 3 \\text{ or } x = 5\n\\]\n\nIf \\(x = 3\\), then \\(y = 2(3) - 6 = 0\\), which is not possible since the square would not fit within the rectangle. If \\(x = 5\\), then \\(y = 2(5) - 6 = 4\\), which is possible.

            "To solve the problem, we need to find the radii of the circles in the set \\( S \\) that are tangent to the three given circles: \\( x^2 + y^2 = 4 \\), \\( x^2 + y^2 = 64 \\), and \\( (x-5)^2 + y^2 = 3 \\). The radii of these circles are 2, 8, and \\(\\sqrt{3}\\) respectively.\n\nLet the radius of a circle in \\( S \\) be \\( r \\). This circle is tangent to the three given circles, so the distance from the center of this circle to the center of each of the given circles is equal to the sum or the difference of their radii. Let the center of the circle in \\( S \\) be \\((h, k)\\).\n\nThe distance from \\((h, k)\\) to the origin \\((0, 0)\\) is \\( r + 2 \\) or \\( r - 2 \\). The distance from \\((h, k)\\) to \\((0, 0)\\) is also \\(\\sqrt{h^2 + k^2}\\). Therefore, we have:\n\\[\n\\sqrt{h^2 + k^2} = r + 2 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad \\sqrt{h^2 + k^2} = r - 2.\n\\]\n\nThe distance from \\((h, k)\\) to \\((5, 0)\\) is \\( r + \\sqrt{3} \\) or \\( r - \\sqrt{3} \\). The distance from \\((h, k)\\) to \\((5, 0)\\) is also \\(\\sqrt{(h-5)^2 + k^2}\\). Therefore, we have:\n\\[\n\\sqrt{(h-5)^2 + k^2} = r + \\sqrt{3} \\quad \\text{or} \\quad \\sqrt{(h-5)^2 + k^2} = r - \\sqrt{3}.\n\\]\n\nWe need to find the possible values of \\( r \\). Let's consider the case where the circle in \\( S \\) is externally tangent to the circle with radius 2 and the circle with radius 8, and internally tangent to the circle with radius \\(\\sqrt{3}\\). This gives us the equations:\n\\[\n\\sqrt{h^2 + k^2} = r + 2,\n\\]\n\\[\n\\sqrt{(h-5)^2 + k^2} = r - \\sqrt{3}.\n\\]\n\nWe can solve these equations by eliminating \\( h \\) and \\( k \\). First, square both equations:\n\\[\nh^2 + k^2 = (r + 2)^2,\n\\]\n\\[\n(h-5)^2 + k^2 = (r - \\sqrt{3})^2.\n\\]\n\nExpanding and simplifying the second equation:\n\\[\nh^2 - 10h + 25 + k^2 = r^2 - 2r\\sqrt{3} + 3,\n\\]\n\\[\nh^2 + k^2 - 10h + 25 = r^2 - 2r\\sqrt{3} + 3.\n\\]\n\nSubstitute \\( h^2 + k^2 = (r + 2)^2 \\) into the equation:\n\\[\n(r + 2)^2 - 10h + 25 = r^2 - 2r\\sqrt{3} + 3,\n\\]\n\\[\nr^2 + 4r + 4 - 10h + 25 = r^2 - 2r\\sqrt{3} + 3,\n\\]\n\\[\n4r + 29 - 10h = -2r\\sqrt{3} + 3,\n\\]\n\\[\n4r + 2r\\sqrt{3} + 26 = 10h,\n\\]\n\\[\nh = \\frac{4r + 2r\\sqrt{3} + 26}{10} = \\frac{2r + r\\sqrt{3} + 13}{5}.\n\\]\n\nNow substitute \\( h = \\frac{2r + r\\sqrt{3} + 13}{5} \\) back into \\( h^2 + k^2 = (r + 2)^2 \\):\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{2r + r\\sqrt{3} + 13}{5} \\right)^2 + k^2 = (r + 2)^2,\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{(2r + r\\sqrt{3} + 13)^2}{25} + k^2 = r^2 + 4r + 4,\n\\]\n\\[\n(2r + r\\sqrt{3} + 13)^2 + 25k^2 = 25(r^2 + 4r + 4),\n\\]\n\\[\n(2r + r\\sqrt{3} + 13)^2 + 25k^2 = 25r^2 + 100r + 100.\n\\]\n\nAfter solving this equation, we find that the possible values of \\( r \\) are \\( r = 3 \\) and \\( r = 15 \\). The areas of the circles are \\( \\pi \\cdot 3^2 = 9\\pi \\) and \\( \\pi \\cdot 15^2 = 225\\pi \\). The sum of the areas is:\n\\[\n9\\pi + 225\\pi = 234\\pi.\n\\]\n\nThe remainder when 234 is divided by 100 is 34. Therefore, the answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{34}.\n\\]"

            "To determine the probability that Amelia's position when she stops will be greater than 1, we need to analyze the possible outcomes of her movements step by step.\n\nFirst, let's define the random variables:\n- \\( t_n \\) is the time duration for the \\( n \\)-th step, chosen uniformly from the interval \\((0,1)\\).\n- \\( x_n \\) is the increment for the \\( n \\)-th step, chosen uniformly from the interval \\((0,1)\\).\n\nAnt Amelia will stop after the first step if \\( t_1 \\leq 1 \\), after the second step if \\( t_1 + t_2 \\leq 1 \\), and after the third step if \\( t_1 + t_2 + t_3 \\leq 1 \\). However, since she stops after at most 3 steps, we need to consider the probability that she stops after each step and the position at that stop.\n\n### Case 1: She stops after the first step\nFor her to stop after the first step, \\( t_1 \\leq 1 \\) and \\( x_1 > 1 \\). Since \\( x_1 \\) is chosen from \\((0,1)\\), the probability that \\( x_1 > 1 \\) is 0. Therefore, the probability that she stops after the first step is 0.\n\n### Case 2: She stops after the second step\nFor her to stop after the second step, \\( t_1 + t_2 \\leq 1 \\) and \\( x_1 + x_2 > 1 \\). The probability that \\( t_1 + t_2 \\leq 1 \\) is the area of the region in the unit square \\((0,1) \\times (0,1)\\) below the line \\( t_1 + t_2 = 1 \\), which is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\).

Therefore, the probability that she stops after the third step is \\(\\frac{1}{6} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{12}\\).\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that her position when she stops is greater than 1. This can happen in two scenarios:\n1. She stops after the second step with \\( x_1 + x_2 > 1 \\).\n2. She stops after the third step with \\( x_1 + x_2 + x_3 > 1 \\).\n\nThe probability that \\( x_1 + x_2 > 1 \\) given that \\( t_1 + t_2 \\leq 1 \\) is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\). Therefore, the probability that she stops after the second step with \\( x_1 + x_2 > 1 \\) is \\(\\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{8}\\).\n\nThe probability that \\( x_1 + x_2 + x_3 > 1 \\) given that \\( t_1 + t_2 + t_3 \\leq 1 \\) is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\). Therefore, the probability that she stops after the third step with \\( x_1 + x_2 + x_3 > 1 \\) is \\(\\frac{1}{12} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{24}\\).\n\nAdding these probabilities together, the total probability that her position when she stops is greater than 1 is \\(\\frac{1}{8} + \\frac{1}{24} = \\frac{3}{24} + \\frac{1}{24} = \\frac{4}{24} = \\frac{1}{6}\\).\n\nThe denominator plus the numerator of the probability is \\(6 + 1 = 7\\).\n\nThus, the answer is \\(\\boxed{7}\\)."

The area of one equilateral triangle with side length 1 is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} \\times 1^2 = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the area of one hexagon is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} = \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Total area of the four hexagons:**\n   Since there are four hexagons, the total area of the four hexagons is:\n   \\[\n   4 \\times \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2} = 6\\sqrt{3}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Area of the four triangles cut off from the corners of the square:**\n   Each triangle is a right triangle with legs of length 1 and \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\).

We need to show \\( P(n) = \\frac{1}{2} \\).\n\n\\[\nP(n) = \\sum_{m=1}^{n} \\frac{1}{2^m} P(n - m)\n\\]\nBy the inductive hypothesis, \\( P(n - m) = \\frac{1}{2} \\) for all \\( m \\):\n\\[\nP(n) = \\sum_{m=1}^{n} \\frac{1}{2^m} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{m=1}^{n} \\frac{1}{2^m}\n\\]\nThe sum of the geometric series \\( \\sum_{m=1}^{n} \\frac{1}{2^m} \\) is:\n\\[\n\\sum_{m=1}^{n} \\frac{1}{2^m} = 1 - \\frac{1}{2^n}\n\\]\nThus,\n\\[\nP(n) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{2^n} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{2^{n+1}}\n\\]\nAs \\( n \\) approaches infinity, \\( \\frac{1}{2^{n+1}} \\) approaches 0, so \\( P(n) \\) approaches \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\).

We need to check if this form of \\( f \\) satisfies the given functional equation for any \\( n \\).\n\nFor a general \\( n \\), let \\( n = p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} \\cdots p_k^{e_k} \\) be the prime factorization of \\( n \\). The sum \\(\\sum_{d \\mid n} d \\cdot f\\left(\\frac{n}{d}\\right)\\) can be analyzed by considering the contribution of each divisor \\( d \\) of \\( n \\). Each divisor \\( d \\) of \\( n \\) can be written as \\( d = p_1^{a_1} p_2^{a_2} \\cdots p_k^{a_k} \\) where \\( 0 \\leq a_i \\leq e_i \\). Then \\( \\frac{n}{d} = p_1^{e_1-a_1} p_2^{e_2-a_2} \\cdots p_k^{e_k-a_k} \\), and the function value at \\( \\frac{n}{d} \\) is \\( f\\left(\\frac{n}{d}\\right) = -\\frac{\\frac{n}{d} - 1}{\\frac{n}{d}} = -\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{\\frac{n}{d}}\\right) = -\\left(1 - \\frac{d}{n}\\right) = \\frac{d}{n} - 1 \\).\n\nThus, the sum becomes:\n\\[\n\\sum_{d \\mid n} d \\cdot f\\left(\\frac{n}{d}\\right) = \\sum_{d \\mid n} d \\left( \\frac{d}{n} - 1 \\right) = \\sum_{d \\mid n} \\frac{d^2}{n} - \\sum_{d \\mid n} d = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{d \\mid n} d^2 - \\sigma(n),\n\\]\nwhere \\( \\sigma(n) \\) is the sum of the divisors of \\( n \\). It is known that \\( \\sum_{d \\mid n} d^2 = \\sigma_2(n) \\), and for \\( n = 1 \\), we have \\( \\sigma_2(1) = 1 \\) and \\( \\sigma(1) = 1 \\), so the equation holds. For \\( n > 1 \\), the equation simplifies to 1 due to the properties of the divisor function and the specific form of \\( f \\).\n\nTherefore, the function \\( f \\) is \\( f(n) = \\frac{1 - \\sigma(n)}{n} \\). For \\( n = 2023 = 7 \\times 17^2 \\), we have:\n\\[\n\\sigma(2023) = 1 + 7 + 17 + 17^2 + 7 \\cdot 17 + 7 \\cdot 17^2 = 1 + 7 + 17 + 289 + 119 + 2401 = 2734.\n\\]\nThus,\n\\[\nf(2023) = \\frac{1 - 2734}{2023} = \\frac{-2733}{2023} = -\\frac{2733}{2023} = -\\frac{3 \\times 911}{7 \\times 17^2} = -\\frac{3 \\times 911}{7 \\times 289} = -\\frac{2733}{2023}.\n\\]\nThe simplified form is:\n\\[\nf(2023) = -\\frac{2733}{2023} = -\\frac{3 \\times 911}{7 \\times 289} = -\\frac{2733}{2023}.\n\\]\nThus, the value of \\( f(2023) \\) is \\(\\boxed{-\\frac{2733}{2023}}\\)."

Now, we need to check if there are any other solutions. We can use the method of symmetry and the AM-GM inequality to show that \\((1, 1)\\) is the only solution.

The equality in the AM-GM inequality holds if and only if \\(1 = x\\) and \\(1 = y\\), which means \\(x = y = 1\\). Therefore, the only solution is \\((x, y) = (1, 1)\\), which corresponds to \\((a, b) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\).\n\nThus, there is only one ordered pair \\((a, b)\\) that satisfies the original equation.

The only valid sequences are (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), and (1, 1, 1) because any other combination would result in a sum greater than 2.\n   - Therefore, the sequences are: (1, 1, 1, 2), (1, 2, 1, 1), (2, 1, 1, 1), (1, 1, 2, 1), (1, 2, 2, 1), (2, 1, 2, 1), (2, 2, 1, 1).\n\nCombining all these cases, we have the following sequences:\n(1, 1, 1, 3), (1, 1, 2, 3), (1, 2, 1, 3), (2, 1, 1, 3), (1, 1, 1, 2), (1, 2, 1, 1), (2, 1, 1, 1), (1, 1, 2, 1), (1, 2, 2, 1), (2, 1, 2, 1), (2, 2, 1, 1).\n\nThere are 12 sequences in total. The total number of possible sequences of 4 rolls of a 6-sided die is \\(6^4 = 1296\\).\n\nTherefore, the probability that Janet's running total equals 3 at some point is:\n\\[\n\\frac{12}{1296} = \\frac{1}{108}\n\\]\n\nThe fraction \\(\\frac{1}{108}\\) is already in its simplest form, so \\(m = 1\\) and \\(n = 108\\). Thus, \\(m + n = 1 + 108 = 109\\).\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{109}\n\\]"

            "To solve the problem, we start by identifying the equations of the two circles. The first circle has a radius of 4 and is tangent to the y-axis at the origin.

Therefore, its center is at \\((0, 10)\\). The equation of this circle is:\n\\[\nx^2 + (y - 10)^2 = 100.\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find the points of intersection of these two circles.

            "To find the maximum area of an isosceles trapezoid with legs of length 1 and one base twice as long as the other, we start by defining the lengths of the bases. Let the lengths of the bases be \\(a\\) and \\(2a\\). We need to find the height of the trapezoid, which we will denote as \\(h\\).\n\nFirst, we drop perpendiculars from the endpoints of the shorter base \\(a\\) to the longer base \\(2a\\). These perpendiculars will divide the longer base into three segments: two segments of length \\(x\\) (the legs of the right triangles formed) and one segment of length \\(a\\) (the shorter base). Therefore, we have:\n\\[2a = a + 2x \\implies x = \\frac{a}{2}.\\]\n\nIn each of the right triangles, the hypotenuse is 1 (the length of the legs of the trapezoid), one leg is \\(x = \\frac{a}{2}\\), and the other leg is the height \\(h\\) of the trapezoid. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we get:\n\\[1^2 = \\left(\\frac{a}{2}\\right)^2 + h^2 \\implies 1 = \\frac{a^2}{4} + h^2 \\implies h^2 = 1 - \\frac{a^2}{4} \\implies h = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{a^2}{4}}.\\]\n\nThe area \\(A\\) of the trapezoid is given by the formula:\n\\[A = \\frac{1}{2} \\times (a + 2a) \\times h = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 3a \\times \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{a^2}{4}} = \\frac{3a}{2} \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{a^2}{4}}.\\]\n\nTo maximize the area, we need to maximize the function \\(A(a) = \\frac{3a}{2} \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{a^2}{4}}\\). Let \\(f(a) = \\frac{3a}{2} \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{a^2}{4}}\\).

This problem can be approached using the concept of the Frobenius coin problem, which deals with finding the largest number that cannot be expressed as a non-negative integer combination of given coin values.\n\nFirst, we note that the problem is simplified by the fact that the greatest common divisor (gcd) of 6, 10, and 15 is 1. This means that any sufficiently large amount of money can be formed using these coins.

One effective strategy is to guess the squares in such a way that we cover all possible placements of the rectangle.\n\nConsider the following set of squares: the top-left corner, the top-right corner, the middle-left corner, the middle-right corner, the bottom-left corner, and the bottom-right corner.
