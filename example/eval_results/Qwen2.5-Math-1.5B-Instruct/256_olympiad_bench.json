            "To determine the number \\( N \\) that Xenia thought of, we need to understand the constraints and the information provided by each move.

With this information, he can determine the value of \\( N \\) modulo the least common multiple of the numbers 1 through 20, which is 232792560. Since \\( N \\) is between 1 and 5000, he can narrow down the possibilities to a smaller range of numbers.\n\nBy continuing this process, Sergey can determine the value of \\( N \\) in a finite number of moves. The key is to use the information from each move to narrow down the possibilities for \\( N \\) until he can determine the exact value.\n\nThe number of moves required to determine \\( N \\) is the number of distinct sets \\( S \\) that Sergey can ask about, which is equal to the number of distinct subsets of the set \\(\\{1, 2, \\ldots, 20\\}\\). The number of subsets of a set with 20 elements is \\( 2^{20} \\), but since we are only interested in the subsets that give us new information, we need to consider the number of distinct congruences that can be formed. The number of distinct congruences that can be formed is equal to the number of distinct sets \\( S \\) that can be asked about, which is 20.\n\nTherefore, the number of moves required to determine \\( N \\) is \\(\\boxed{20}\\)."

These numbers are all the possible combinations of 2017 bits (each bit can be either 0 or 1).

Half of these numbers will have an even weight and the other half will have an odd weight.

A collection is tight if:\n1. The union of the subsets is a proper subset of \\(X\\).\n2. No element of \\(X\\) lies in exactly one of the subsets.\n\nThis means that every element of \\(X\\) must lie in at least two of the subsets, or in all of them. If we exclude the element from the union, it must lie in an even number of subsets (since it cannot be in exactly one subset).\n\nNow, let's consider the maximum number of subsets we can have without forming a tight collection. If we have a collection of subsets where every element of \\(X\\) lies in at least two subsets, then the union of any non-empty sub collection of these subsets will not be a proper subset of \\(X\\), because each element will still be in at least one subset, and thus the union will be \\(X\\) itself or a proper subset that includes all elements.\n\nTo maximize the number of subsets, we can consider the following construction: for each element \\(x \\in X\\), include all subsets that contain \\(x\\) in our collection. This way, every element is in at least two subsets (since each element is in the subset it is in and at least one other subset), and thus no sub collection can be tight.\n\nThe number of such subsets is the number of non-empty subsets of \\(X\\) that contain a fixed element \\(x\\). Since there are \\(n\\) elements in \\(X\\), and for each element we can form \\(2^{n-1} - 1\\) non-empty subsets (excluding the empty set), the total number of subsets is \\(n \\cdot (2^{n-1} - 1)\\).\n\nHowever, we need to ensure that we are not counting the empty set, and we are only considering proper subsets. The correct count is actually \\(2^n - 1 - (n-1) = 2^n - n\\), because we subtract the \\(n-1\\) subsets that do not include a fixed element.\n\nThus, the largest cardinality of a collection of proper non-empty subsets of \\(X\\), no non-empty sub collection of which is tight, is \\(\\boxed{2^n - n - 1}\\)."

            "To determine the smallest possible degree of the polynomial \\( f \\), we need to analyze the conditions under which the polynomial \\( f \\) evaluates to zero.

This means that \\( f \\) must be zero for all configurations of points that satisfy the geometric condition of forming a regular \\( 2n \\)-gon or being all equal.\n\nFirst, let's consider the geometric condition. A regular \\( 2n \\)-gon is a highly symmetric figure, and its vertices can be described by a set of points that are equally spaced on a circle.

For example, if we consider the points in the complex plane, the vertices of a regular \\( 2n \\)-gon can be represented as the \\( 2n \\)-th roots of unity scaled and translated appropriately. The polynomial that defines these points is a product of factors that ensure the points are equally spaced.\n\nThe degree of this polynomial is determined by the number of points and the symmetry of the \\( 2n \\)-gon. Specifically, the polynomial that defines the vertices of a regular \\( 2n \\)-gon is a polynomial of degree \\( 2n \\) in the coordinates of the points. This is because each vertex of the \\( 2n \\)-gon is determined by a unique combination of the coordinates, and there are \\( 2n \\) vertices.\n\nTherefore, the polynomial \\( f \\) must be of degree at least \\( 2n \\) to detect the condition that the points form a regular \\( 2n \\)-gon or are all equal. We can construct such a polynomial by taking the product of the polynomials that define the vertices of the \\( 2n \\)-gon and the polynomial that ensures all points are equal. The degree of this polynomial will be \\( 2n \\).\n\nThus, the smallest possible degree of \\( f \\) is \\(\\boxed{2n}\\)."

Then the equation becomes\n\n\\[\nf(x + c) = f(x + 1) + c.\n\\]\n\nIf we set \\( x = 1 \\) in this equation, we get\n\n\\[\nf(1 + c) = f(2) + c.\n\\]\n\nNow, let's use the original equation \\( P(x, y) \\) with \\( y = 1 \\):\n\n\\[\nf(x + f(1)) = f(x + 1) + f(1),\n\\]\n\\[\nf(x + c) = f(x + 1) + c.\n\\]\n\nThis is consistent with our previous result. To find more information, let's try \\( P(x, x) \\):\n\n\\[\nf(x + f(x)) = f(2x) + f(x).\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Assume a linear form for \\( f \\)\n\nLet's assume \\( f(x) = kx \\) for some constant \\( k > 0 \\). Substitute \\( f(x) = kx \\) into the original equation:\n\n\\[\nf(x + f(y)) = f(x + ky) = k(x + ky) = kx + k^2y,\n\\]\n\\[\nf(x + y) + f(y) = k(x + y) + ky = kx + ky + ky = kx + 2ky.\n\\]\n\nFor these to be equal, we need \\( k^2 = 2k \\), which gives \\( k = 2 \\) (since \\( k \\neq 0 \\)). Therefore, \\( f(x) = 2x \\) is a candidate solution. We need to verify that this function satisfies the original equation:\n\n\\[\nf(x + f(y)) = f(x + 2y) = 2(x + 2y) = 2x + 4y,\n\\]\n\\[\nf(x + y) + f(y) = 2(x + y) + 2y = 2x + 2y + 2y = 2x + 4y.\n\\]\n\nSince both sides are equal, \\( f(x) = 2x \\) is indeed a solution. To show that this is the only solution, we need to prove that \\( f \\) is injective and that no other forms of \\( f \\) satisfy the equation. Given the steps and the nature of the functional equation, it can be shown that \\( f(x) = 2x \\) is the only solution.\n\nThus, the only function \\( f: \\mathbb{R}^{+} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{+} \\) that satisfies the given functional equation is\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{f(x) = 2x}.\n\\]"

We need to find planes that cover all these points but do not pass through the origin.\n\nOne way to approach this is to consider the planes that are parallel to the coordinate planes and pass through the points where one of the coordinates is fixed at 1. Specifically, we can use the planes \\( x = 1 \\), \\( y = 1 \\), and \\( z = 1 \\).

For example, the planes \\( x = 1 \\) and \\( y = 1 \\) do not cover points where \\( z \\) is at least 2, and similarly for the other pairs of planes. Therefore, three planes are necessary.\n\nThus, the smallest number of planes that jointly contain all points of \\( S \\) but none of them passes through the origin is \\(\\boxed{3}\\)."

This means that each subset \\( A_i \\) must be able to generate all sums from 15 upwards by summing distinct pairs of its elements.\n\nWe start by examining the smallest possible values of \\( n \\) and how they can be formed. For \\( n = 15 \\), we need two distinct elements in each subset \\( A_i \\) that sum to 15. The pairs that sum to 15 are \\((1, 14), (2, 13), (3, 12), (4, 11), (5, 10), (6, 9), (7, 8)\\). This means that each subset \\( A_i \\) must contain at least one element from each of these pairs to ensure that we can always find two distinct elements that sum to 15.\n\nNow, let's consider the general case for \\( n \\geq 15 \\). If we have \\( k \\) subsets, each subset must be able to generate all sums from 15 upwards. This means that each subset must be able to generate a sufficient number of sums to cover all \\( n \\geq 15 \\). If we have \\( k = 2 \\), we can partition the positive integers into two subsets such that each subset can generate all sums from 15 upwards. For example, we can put all the odd numbers in one subset and all the even numbers in the other subset. This works because any even number \\( n \\geq 16 \\) can be written as the sum of two even numbers, and any odd number \\( n \\geq 15 \\) can be written as the sum of an odd number and an even number.\n\nHowever, if we try to partition the positive integers into three subsets, we need to ensure that each subset can generate all sums from 15 upwards. This is not possible with three subsets because we would need each subset to be able to generate a sufficient number of sums, and it is not possible to partition the positive integers into three subsets such that each subset can generate all sums from 15 upwards. For example, if we have the subsets of odd numbers, even numbers, and numbers of the form \\( 3m+1 \\) and \\( 3m+2 \\), we can see that the subset of even numbers cannot generate all sums from 15 upwards because it cannot generate odd sums.\n\nTherefore, the greatest possible value of \\( k \\) is 2. We can partition the positive integers into two subsets such that each subset can generate all sums from 15 upwards. For example, we can put all the odd numbers in one subset and all the even numbers in the other subset.\n\nThus, the greatest positive integer \\( k \\) that satisfies the given property is \\(\\boxed{2}\\)."

Specifically, if we consider the checkerboard as a grid of unit squares and each ant as a point moving in one of the four directions (up, down, left, right), we can transform the problem into a problem of ant movement in a grid where the ants turn \\(90^\\circ\\) clockwise when they meet.\n\n3. **Transforming the Problem:**\n   - We can transform the problem by considering the ants as if they are moving in a grid where the ants turn \\(90^\\circ\\) clockwise when they meet. This transformation simplifies the problem because it allows us to consider the ants as moving in a straight line in a transformed coordinate system.\n   - In this transformed coordinate system, the ants will eventually reach the edges of the checkerboard, and the latest possible moment at which the last ant falls off the checkerboard is determined by the maximum distance an ant can travel before reaching the edge of the checkerboard.\n\n4. **Calculating the latest possible moment:**\n   - The maximum distance an ant can travel before reaching the edge of the checkerboard is \\(m-1\\) units, where \\(m\\) is the side length of the checkerboard.\n   - Since each ant moves with speed 1, the latest possible moment at which the last ant falls off the checkerboard is \\(m-1\\).\n\nTherefore, the latest possible moment at which the last ant falls off the checkerboard is \\(\\boxed{m-1}\\)."

            "To determine the smallest positive integer \\( M \\) such that among any \\( M \\) distinct flags, there exist \\( N \\) flags forming a diverse set, we need to analyze the properties of the flags and the conditions for a diverse set.\n\nFirst, let's understand the problem in terms of combinatorics. Each flag is an \\( N \\)-unit wide and 1-unit high flag composed of \\( N \\) fields, each field being either yellow or blue. Therefore, there are \\( 2^N \\) possible flags, since each of the \\( N \\) fields can be either yellow or blue.\n\nA set of \\( N \\) flags is diverse if these flags can be arranged into an \\( N \\times N \\) square so that all \\( N \\) fields on its main diagonal will have the same color. This means that for a set of \\( N \\) flags to be diverse, there must be a way to arrange them such that all the fields on the main diagonal of the \\( N \\times N \\) square are either all yellow or all blue.\n\nTo find the smallest \\( M \\) such that among any \\( M \\) distinct flags, there exist \\( N \\) flags forming a diverse set, we can use the pigeonhole principle. The pigeonhole principle states that if \\( M \\) items are put into \\( N \\) containers, with \\( M > N \\), then at least one container must contain more than one item.\n\nIn this context, the \"containers\" are the possible colorings of the main diagonal of the \\( N \\times N \\) square. There are \\( 2 \\) possible colorings for the main diagonal: all yellow or all blue. Therefore, if we have more than \\( 2 \\cdot (2^N - 1) \\) flags, we are guaranteed that there will be at least \\( N \\) flags that can be arranged to form a diverse set.\n\nTo see why, consider the worst-case scenario where we have \\( 2 \\cdot (2^N - 1) \\) flags. In this case, we could have \\( 2^N - 1 \\) flags that are all yellow on the main diagonal and \\( 2^N - 1 \\) flags that are all blue on the main diagonal.

This is a classic problem in combinatorial design, specifically related to the construction of a 100 by 100 binary matrix with exactly 25 ones in each row and each column, and no two ones in adjacent positions (including diagonally).\n\nFirst, let's understand the constraints. Each king must be placed such that no two kings are adjacent, which means that each king must be surrounded by empty squares. This implies that the kings must be placed in a checkerboard pattern, but with a specific arrangement that ensures each row and each column has exactly 25 kings.\n\nOne way to approach this is to use the concept of a \"balanced incomplete block design\" or more specifically, a \"concurrent 100-1-25 design\". However, a simpler and more direct approach is to use the fact that the problem is equivalent to finding the number of ways to place 25 non-attacking kings on a $100 \\times 100$ board such that each row and each column has exactly 25 kings.\n\nThe solution to this problem is known to be given by the number of ways to permute 100 elements taken 25 at a time, which is the same as the number of ways to choose 25 positions in each row such that no two chosen positions are adjacent. This is a well-known result in combinatorial design theory, and the number of such arrangements is given by the formula for the number of 100 by 100 0-1 matrices with exactly 25 ones in each row and each column, and no two ones in adjacent positions. This number is known to be:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{100!}{(25!)^4}\n\\]\n\nHowever, the exact numerical value of this expression is not necessary for the problem, as the problem asks for the number of such arrangements, and the answer is known to be:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{0}\n\\]\n\nThis is because it is impossible to place 2500 kings on a $100 \\times 100$ chessboard such that no two kings are adjacent and each row and each column contains exactly 25 kings. The reason is that if we place a king in a square, the adjacent squares (up, down, left, right, and diagonally) cannot contain any kings. This means that each king effectively \"blocks\" a 3x3 area around it, and it is impossible to place 2500 such kings without violating the condition that each row and each column contains exactly 25 kings."

Let's start by analyzing the properties of the diagonals and the triangles formed.\n\n1. **Understanding the Diagonals:**\n   - A diagonal of a regular 2006-gon is called odd if its endpoints divide the boundary into two parts, each composed of an odd number of sides. This means that if we label the vertices of the 2006-gon as \\(A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_{2006}\\), a diagonal \\(A_iA_j\\) is odd if both \\(i-j\\) and \\(2006 - (i-j)\\) are odd. This is equivalent to saying that \\(i-j\\) is odd.\n   - Sides of the 2006-gon are also considered as odd diagonals.\n\n2. **Properties of Isosceles Triangles:**\n   - An isosceles triangle with two odd sides must have its base as an even side (a side of the 2006-gon) and the two equal sides as odd diagonals. This is because the sum of two odd numbers is even, and the sum of an odd number and an even number is odd.\n\n3. **Counting the Isosceles Triangles:**\n   - In a regular 2006-gon, each vertex is connected to 1002 other vertices by odd diagonals (since 2006 is even, each vertex is connected to half of the other vertices by odd diagonals).\n   - When we dissect the 2006-gon into triangles using 2003 nonintersecting diagonals, each triangle will have either two odd sides or two even sides. We are interested in the triangles with two odd sides.\n   - Each vertex of the 2006-gon is part of exactly one isosceles triangle with two odd sides. This is because each vertex is the apex of exactly one such triangle (the triangle formed by the vertex, the two vertices connected to it by odd diagonals, and the side of the 2006-gon between those two vertices).\n   - Since there are 2006 vertices, and each vertex is part of exactly one such triangle, the maximum number of isosceles triangles with two odd sides is 1003. This is because each triangle is counted twice (once for each of its two odd sides), so we need to divide the total by 2.\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible number of isosceles triangles with two odd sides is \\(\\boxed{1003}\\)."

            "To determine the largest \\( N \\) for which there exists a table \\( T \\) of integers with \\( N \\) rows and 100 columns that satisfies the given properties, we need to analyze the constraints carefully.\n\nFirst, let's understand the properties of the table:\n1. Every row contains the numbers 1, 2, ..., 100 in some order.\n2. For any two distinct rows \\( r \\) and \\( s \\), there is a column \\( c \\) such that \\( |T(r, c) - T(s, c)| \\geq 2 \\).\n\nThis second property implies that if we consider any two rows, there must be at least one column where the difference between the numbers in that column is at least 2. This means that the numbers in the same column of any two rows must be sufficiently far apart.\n\nTo maximize \\( N \\), we need to consider how we can arrange the numbers in the columns to satisfy the second property. One way to approach this is to use a combinatorial argument based on the pigeonhole principle.\n\nConsider the possible values that can appear in each column. If we have more than 50 rows, then by the pigeonhole principle, at least two rows must have the same number in a particular column. However, this would violate the second property because the difference between the same number is 0, which is less than 2. Therefore, the maximum number of rows \\( N \\) must be such that no two rows have the same number in any column.\n\nSince there are 100 possible numbers (1 through 100) and each column can have at most 50 different numbers (to ensure that any two rows have different numbers in at least one column), the maximum number of rows \\( N \\) is 50. This is because if we have 51 or more rows, then by the pigeonhole principle, at least one number must appear in the same column in at least two rows, which would violate the second property.\n\nTo confirm, let's construct such a table. We can arrange the numbers in the columns such that each column alternates between two sets of 50 numbers. For example, the first column could be 1, 3, 5, ..., 99, the second column could be 2, 4, 6, ..., 100, the third column could be 1, 3, 5, ..., 99, and so on. This arrangement ensures that any two rows will have different numbers in at least one column, and the difference between any two different numbers in the same column is at least 2.\n\nTherefore, the largest \\( N \\) for which such a table exists is \\(\\boxed{50}\\)."

The condition that the same set of colors appears in both of the other groups means that the sets of colors in the \\( x \\)-axis boxes, \\( y \\)-axis boxes, and \\( z \\)-axis boxes must all be the same set of colors.\n\nTo maximize the number of colors, we need to consider how the colors can be distributed. If we have \\( k \\) different colors, then each \\( n \\times n \\times 1 \\) box must contain exactly these \\( k \\) colors. This means that each color must appear in at least \\( n \\) different \\( n \\times n \\times 1 \\) boxes (one for each orientation).\n\nNow, let's count the total number of \\( n \\times n \\times 1 \\) boxes. There are \\( n \\) boxes along each axis, so there are \\( 3n \\) sets of colors in total. Since each set must be the same, the number of different sets of colors is 1. This means that each set must contain exactly \\( n \\) different colors (one for each orientation).\n\nTo maximize the number of colors, we need to ensure that each color appears in exactly \\( n \\) different boxes. This can be achieved by coloring the unit cubes in a way that each color appears exactly once in each \\( n \\times n \\times 1 \\) box. One way to do this is to use a Latin square for each layer of the cube. A Latin square of order \\( n \\) is an \\( n \\times n \\) array filled with \\( n \\) different symbols, each occurring exactly once in each row and exactly once in each column.\n\nBy using a Latin square for each layer, we can ensure that each color appears exactly once in each \\( n \\times n \\times 1 \\) box. Therefore, the maximal number of colors that can be present is \\( n \\).\n\nThus, the maximal possible number of colors that are present is \\(\\boxed{n}\\)."

            "To determine the maximum number of tangent segments that can be drawn between 2017 mutually external circles on a blackboard, we need to consider the properties of the circles and the constraints given in the problem. Specifically, we need to ensure that no two tangent segments intersect each other or any of the circles.\n\nFirst, let's understand the structure of the problem. Each pair of circles can have at most two common external tangents. However, since no three circles share a common tangent, each pair of circles can have at most one tangent segment drawn between them without intersecting any other circles or tangent segments. This means that the problem reduces to finding the maximum number of non-intersecting tangent segments that can be drawn between the circles.\n\nWe can model this problem using a graph where each circle is a vertex and each tangent segment is an edge. The condition that no two tangent segments intersect each other or any of the circles means that the graph must be planar. According to Euler's formula for planar graphs, for a planar graph with \\( V \\) vertices, \\( E \\) edges, and \\( F \\) faces (including the outer face), the following relationship holds:\n\\[ V - E + F = 2. \\]\nIn our case, \\( V = 2017 \\). The number of faces \\( F \\) in our graph is at least 2 (the outer face and the face inside the graph). To maximize the number of edges \\( E \\), we need to minimize the number of faces. The minimum number of faces is 2, which occurs when the graph is a tree (a connected graph with no cycles). For a tree, \\( F = 2 \\) and \\( E = V - 1 \\). Therefore, the maximum number of edges in a planar graph with 2017 vertices is:\n\\[ E = 2017 - 1 = 2016. \\]\nThis means that the maximum number of tangent segments that can be drawn is 2016.\n\nTo verify that this is indeed possible, we can construct such a graph. Start with one circle and draw tangent segments to each of the other 2016 circles, ensuring that no two tangent segments intersect. This can be done by drawing the tangent segments in a way that no two segments cross each other. This is always possible because the circles are mutually external and no three circles share a common tangent.\n\nTherefore, the only possible number of tangent segments when Luciano stops drawing is:\n\\[ \\boxed{2016}. \\]"

Let's denote these ratios by \\( r_1, r_2, r_3, r_4, r_5 \\), where \\( r_i = \\frac{a_i}{a_j} \\) for some \\( j \\neq i \\). We need to show that among these ratios, there exist two that are within a distance of \\( C \\).\n\nFirst, note that there are \\( \\binom{5}{2} = 10 \\) possible pairs of indices \\((i, j)\\) and \\((k, l)\\), but we only need to consider the ratios \\( \\frac{a_i}{a_j} \\) for distinct \\( i, j, k, l \\). We will use the pigeonhole principle to find the smallest \\( C \\).\n\nConsider the set of ratios \\( \\left\\{ \\frac{a_i}{a_j} \\mid 1 \\leq i < j \\leq 5 \\right\\} \\). There are 10 such ratios. We need to show that among these 10 ratios, there are two that are within a distance of \\( C \\).\n\nTo find the smallest \\( C \\), we can use the fact that the ratios are bounded between 0 and \\( \\infty \\). However, we can also consider the ratios in a more structured way. Let's assume without loss of generality that \\( a_1 \\leq a_2 \\leq a_3 \\leq a_4 \\leq a_5 \\). Then the smallest ratio is \\( \\frac{a_1}{a_5} \\) and the largest ratio is \\( \\frac{a_5}{a_1} \\). The difference between the largest and smallest ratio is \\( \\frac{a_5}{a_1} - \\frac{a_1}{a_5} \\).\n\nTo find the smallest \\( C \\), we need to consider the worst-case scenario. The worst-case scenario is when the ratios are as spread out as possible. If we have 10 ratios, the smallest \\( C \\) that guarantees that at least two of these ratios are within \\( C \\) of each other is \\( C = 4 \\). This is because if we divide the interval \\([1, \\infty)\\) into 9 equal subintervals, each subinterval has length 1, and by the pigeonhole principle, at least two of the 10 ratios must fall into the same subinterval, meaning their difference is at most 4.\n\nTo verify, consider the case where the ratios are \\( 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, \\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{1}{4}, \\frac{1}{5}, \\frac{1}{6} \\). The difference between the largest and smallest ratio is \\( 6 - \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{35}{6} \\approx 5.83 \\), but we can always find two ratios within 4 of each other. For example, the ratios 2 and 3 are within 1 of each other, and the ratios 3 and 4 are within 1 of each other, and so on.\n\nTherefore, the smallest real constant \\( C \\) is\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{4}.\n\\]"

The sum of all divisors of \\( n \\) is denoted by \\( \\sigma(n) \\). If we can arrange the divisors of \\( n \\) into a rectangular table where the sums of the rows and columns are equal, then the total sum of all divisors, \\( \\sigma(n) \\), must be divisible by both the number of rows and the number of columns.

If we mark cells in such a way that there is a unique way to partition the board into dominoes, we need to ensure that the marked cells prevent any ambiguity in the partition.\n\nConsider the following strategy: mark cells in a way that forces a specific domino tiling. One effective way to do this is to mark cells in a checkerboard pattern, but we need to ensure that the marking is minimal and still forces a unique tiling.\n\nLet's mark the cells in the first row and the first column, but not the top-left cell. This means we mark \\( 2n - 1 \\) cells in the first row and \\( 2n - 1 \\) cells in the first column, but we don't count the top-left cell twice. This gives us a total of \\( 2n - 1 + 2n - 1 = 4n - 2 \\) marked cells.\n\nNow, let's verify that this marking ensures a unique tiling. If we mark the cells in the first row and the first column as described, any domino that covers a marked cell in the first row must also cover a cell in the first column (or vice versa), and this forces a specific tiling pattern. Specifically, the dominoes must cover the cells in such a way that the marked cells are the only ones that can be covered by the dominoes, ensuring a unique tiling.\n\nTo see why this is the smallest possible \\( k \\), consider that if we mark fewer than \\( 4n - 2 \\) cells, there will be at least one cell in the first row and one cell in the first column that are not marked. This would allow for multiple possible domino tilings, as the marked cells would not uniquely determine the tiling.

            "To determine the smallest \\( n \\) such that Alice can prevent Bob from winning, we need to analyze the game dynamics and the constraints on the pebbles. Let's start by understanding the effect of each round of the game.\n\nIn each round, Bob chooses an integer \\( k \\) with \\( 1 \\leq k \\leq 59 \\) and splits the boxes into two groups: \\( B_1, B_2, \\ldots, B_k \\) and \\( B_{k+1}, B_{k+2}, \\ldots, B_{60} \\). Alice then picks one of these two groups, adds one pebble to each box in that group, and removes one pebble from each box in the other group. This means that the total number of pebbles in the game remains constant after each round.\n\nLet's denote the number of pebbles in box \\( B_i \\) after the \\( i \\)-th round by \\( p_i \\). Initially, \\( p_i = 0 \\) for all \\( i \\). After each round, the total number of pebbles is still \\( n \\). Alice's goal is to prevent any box from having zero pebbles at any point in the game.\n\nTo prevent Bob from winning, Alice needs to ensure that no box ever has zero pebbles. Let's consider the total number of pebbles in the game. Since the total number of pebbles remains constant, the sum of the pebbles in all boxes is always \\( n \\). If Alice can distribute the pebbles in such a way that no box ever has zero pebbles, she will prevent Bob from winning.\n\nThe key insight is that if Alice can ensure that the minimum number of pebbles in any box is always at least 1, then Bob will never be able to make any box have zero pebbles. To achieve this, Alice can distribute the pebbles such that each box has at least one pebble. The minimum number of pebbles required to ensure that each of the 60 boxes has at least one pebble is 60. Therefore, if \\( n \\geq 60 \\), Alice can distribute the pebbles such that each box has at least one pebble, and Bob will never be able to make any box have zero pebbles.\n\nTo see why \\( n = 59 \\) is not sufficient, consider the case where Alice distributes the pebbles such that each box has at least one pebble. If Bob chooses \\( k = 59 \\) and splits the boxes into \\( B_1, B_2, \\ldots, B_{59} \\) and \\( B_{60} \\), Alice can pick the group \\( B_1, B_2, \\ldots, B_{59} \\) and add one pebble to each box in this group, removing one pebble from box \\( B_{60} \\). This will result in box \\( B_{60} \\) having zero pebbles, which means Bob wins.\n\nTherefore, the smallest \\( n \\) such that Alice can prevent Bob from winning is \\( n = 60 \\).\n\nThe answer is \\(\\boxed{60}\\)."

The rule should be transitive: if \\(A\\) beats \\(B\\) and \\(B\\) beats \\(C\\), then \\(A\\) beats \\(C\\).\n\nGiven these conditions, a natural rule that satisfies all of them is to consider the sets \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) as ordered sequences and compare them element by element.

However, we have \\( (a_3 - a_1) - (a_3 - a_2) = a_2 - a_1 \\), which implies \\( r^2 - r^3 = r \\).

We need to find a subsequence of these numbers, where the indices of the subsequence are at most 2 units apart, such that the absolute value of the sum of the subsequence is at least \\( C \\).\n\nTo approach this problem, we can use the pigeonhole principle. Consider the sequence of partial sums \\( S_n = \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i \\) for \\( n = 1, 2, \\ldots, 2022 \\). There are 2022 partial sums, and each sum is an integer between -2022 and 2022. If we consider the sequence of partial sums modulo 3, there are only 3 possible remainders: 0, 1, or 2. By the pigeonhole principle, at least \\(\\left\\lceil \\frac{2022}{3} \\right\\rceil = 675\\) of these partial sums must have the same remainder when divided by 3. Let these partial sums be \\( S_{i_1}, S_{i_2}, \\ldots, S_{i_{675}} \\) with \\( i_1 < i_2 < \\ldots < i_{675} \\).\n\nThe difference between any two of these partial sums is \\( S_{i_j} - S_{i_m} = \\sum_{k=i_j+1}^{i_m} a_k \\). Since \\( i_j \\) and \\( i_m \\) are at most 2 units apart, the difference \\( i_m - i_j \\) is at most 2, so the sum \\( \\sum_{k=i_j+1}^{i_m} a_k \\) is the sum of at most 2 terms, each of which is either +1 or -1. Therefore, the absolute value of this sum is at least 1.\n\nSince we have 675 partial sums with the same remainder modulo 3, the absolute value of the sum of any two of these partial sums is at least 1. Therefore, the absolute value of the sum of the subsequence of these partial sums is at least 675.\n\nTo see that 675 is the largest possible value of \\( C \\), consider the sequence where \\( a_1 = a_2 = \\ldots = a_{2022} = 1 \\). In this case, the sum of any subsequence of length 3 or more is at least 3. However, we can construct a sequence where the sum of any subsequence of length 3 or more is at least 675 by alternating +1 and -1 in a specific pattern. For example, the sequence \\( +1, -1, +1, -1, \\ldots, +1, -1, +1 \\) (with 1011 +1's and 1011 -1's) will have the property that the sum of any subsequence of length 3 or more is at least 675.\n\nTherefore, the largest \\( C \\) is\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{1011}.\n\\]"

Therefore, the number of pairs \\((x, y)\\) such that \\( f(x, y) \\) is odd is exactly half of the total number of pairs \\((x, y)\\) with \\(0 \\leq x, y < 100\\).\n\nThe total number of pairs \\((x, y)\\) is \\(100 \\times 100 = 10000\\). Therefore, the number of pairs \\((x, y)\\) such that \\( f(x, y) \\) is odd is \\( \\frac{10000}{2} = 5000 \\).\n\nSince the function \\( f \\) is strictly increasing in both coordinates, the distribution of odd and even values is uniform. Therefore, the smallest and largest possible value of \\( N \\) is the same, which is 5000.\n\nThus, the smallest and largest possible value of \\( N \\) is \\(\\boxed{5000}\\)."

            "To determine the smallest Pythagorean number, we need to find a number \\( n \\) that has exactly three distinct positive divisors whose sum is equal to 2022. A number with exactly three distinct positive divisors must be the square of a prime number. This is because if \\( n = p^2 \\) where \\( p \\) is a prime, then the divisors of \\( n \\) are \\( 1, p, \\) and \\( p^2 \\). The sum of these divisors is \\( 1 + p + p^2 \\).\n\nWe need to find the smallest prime \\( p \\) such that \\( 1 + p + p^2 = 2022 \\). This can be rewritten as:\n\\[ p^2 + p + 1 = 2022 \\]\n\\[ p^2 + p - 2021 = 0 \\]\n\nWe solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \\( p = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\), where \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = 1 \\), and \\( c = -2021 \\). Substituting these values in, we get:\n\\[ p = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 + 4 \\cdot 2021}}{2} \\]\n\\[ p = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 + 8084}}{2} \\]\n\\[ p = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{8085}}{2} \\]\n\nWe need to find the integer value of \\( p \\). Since \\( p \\) is a prime number, we approximate \\( \\sqrt{8085} \\). We know that \\( 89^2 = 7921 \\) and \\( 90^2 = 8100 \\), so \\( 89 < \\sqrt{8085} < 90 \\). A more precise calculation gives \\( \\sqrt{8085} \\approx 89.91 \\). Therefore:\n\\[ p = \\frac{-1 + 89.91}{2} \\approx \\frac{88.91}{2} \\approx 44.455 \\]\n\nSince \\( p \\) must be a prime number, we round 44.455 to the nearest prime number, which is 43. We check if \\( p = 43 \\) satisfies the equation:\n\\[ 1 + 43 + 43^2 = 1 + 43 + 1849 = 1893 \\]\nSince 1893 is not equal to 2022, we try the next prime number, which is 47:\n\\[ 1 + 47 + 47^2 = 1 + 47 + 2209 = 2257 \\]\nSince 2257 is not equal to 2022, we try the next prime number, which is 41:\n\\[ 1 + 41 + 41^2 = 1 + 41 + 1681 = 1723 \\]\nSince 1723 is not equal to 2022, we try the next prime number, which is 47 again but check the calculation again for any error. We realize we need to recheck the prime number and the calculation. The correct prime number is actually 43, but we need to recheck the calculation for 43 again.

Since a perfect square cannot be congruent to 2 modulo 4, there are no solutions for \\(b \\geq 5\\).\n\nNext, let's consider the case when \\(p = 3\\):\n\\[a^3 = b! + 3.\\]\nWe need to check small values of \\(b\\) to see if we can find any solutions.\n\nFor \\(b = 1\\):\n\\[a^3 = 1! + 3 = 4,\\]\nwhich is not a perfect cube.\n\nFor \\(b = 2\\):\n\\[a^3 = 2! + 3 = 5,\\]\nwhich is not a perfect cube.\n\nFor \\(b = 3\\):\n\\[a^3 = 3! + 3 = 9,\\]\nso \\(a = 2\\).

The key to solving this problem is to understand how many knights can be placed on the board such that no two knights attack each other.\n\nOne useful strategy is to consider the chessboard as a grid of squares and color it in a checkerboard pattern (alternating black and white squares). In a \\( 20 \\times 20 \\) chessboard, there are 200 black squares and 200 white squares. If we place a knight on a black square, it can only attack white squares, and if we place a knight on a white square, it can only attack black squares.

We start by considering the properties of the points and the lines.\n\nFirst, observe that if we have a single line, it can divide the plane into two regions. If we want to ensure that no region contains points of both colors, we need to ensure that each region contains points of only one color. This means that each line must separate the points of one color from the points of the other color.\n\nTo achieve this, we can use the concept of a \"separating line\". A line that separates the points of one color from the points of the other color is called a \"separating line\". If we have \\( r \\) red points and \\( b \\) blue points, we need to draw lines such that each line separates the points of one color from the points of the other color.\n\nThe key insight is that we can use a single line to separate the points if we can find a line that passes between the closest points of the two colors.

The minimum number of lines required to ensure that no region contains points of both colors is \\( k = 2013 \\).\n\nTo see why \\( k = 2013 \\) is sufficient, consider the following argument.

Let's denote the condition by \\( P(m, n) \\):\n\n\\[\nP(m, n): m^2 + f(n) \\mid m f(m) + n.\n\\]\n\nFirst, consider \\( P(1, n) \\):\n\n\\[\n1^2 + f(n) \\mid 1 \\cdot f(1) + n \\implies 1 + f(n) \\mid f(1) + n.\n\\]\n\nThis means that \\( f(1) + n \\) is divisible by \\( 1 + f(n) \\). Therefore, we can write:\n\n\\[\nf(1) + n = k_n (1 + f(n))\n\\]\n\nfor some integer \\( k_n \\). Rearranging, we get:\n\n\\[\nf(1) + n = k_n + k_n f(n) \\implies f(1) - k_n = k_n f(n) - n.\n\\]\n\nSince \\( f(1) - k_n \\) and \\( k_n f(n) - n \\) are both integers, \\( k_n \\) must be such that \\( f(1) - k_n \\) is a multiple of \\( k_n \\). Let's consider the case when \\( n = 1 \\):\n\n\\[\n1 + f(1) \\mid f(1) + 1 \\implies 1 + f(1) \\mid 1.\n\\]\n\nThe only positive integer that divides 1 is 1 itself, so \\( 1 + f(1) = 1 \\), which implies \\( f(1) = 0 \\). However, since \\( f(1) \\) must be a positive integer, this is not possible. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate our approach.\n\nLet's try another approach by considering \\( P(m, 1) \\):\n\n\\[\nm^2 + f(1) \\mid m f(m) + 1.\n\\]\n\nThis means that \\( m f(m) + 1 \\) is divisible by \\( m^2 + f(1) \\). Let's denote \\( f(1) = c \\). Then we have:\n\n\\[\nm f(m) + 1 = k_m (m^2 + c)\n\\]\n\nfor some integer \\( k_m \\). Rearranging, we get:\n\n\\[\nm f(m) + 1 = k_m m^2 + k_m c \\implies m f(m) - k_m m^2 = k_m c - 1.\n\\]\n\nThis equation must hold for all positive integers \\( m \\). Let's consider the case when \\( m = 1 \\):\n\n\\[\n1 \\cdot f(1) + 1 = k_1 (1^2 + c) \\implies c + 1 = k_1 (1 + c).\n\\]\n\nRearranging, we get:\n\n\\[\nc + 1 = k_1 + k_1 c \\implies c + 1 - k_1 c = k_1 \\implies c (1 - k_1) = k_1 - 1.\n\\]\n\nIf \\( k_1 = 1 \\), then \\( c (1 - 1) = 1 - 1 \\implies 0 = 0 \\), which is true. Therefore, \\( k_1 = 1 \\) is a valid solution, and we get \\( c = 1 \\). So, \\( f(1) = 1 \\).\n\nNow, we substitute \\( f(1) = 1 \\) back into the original condition:\n\n\\[\nm^2 + f(n) \\mid m f(m) + n.\n\\]\n\nWe need to find a function \\( f \\) that satisfies this condition. Let's try \\( f(n) = n \\):\n\n\\[\nm^2 + n \\mid m f(m) + n = m^2 + n.\n\\]\n\nThis is clearly true, so \\( f(n) = n \\) is a solution. We need to check if there are any other solutions. Assume there is another function \\( g \\) that satisfies the condition. Then for all \\( m \\) and \\( n \\):\n\n\\[\nm^2 + g(n) \\mid m g(m) + n.\n\\]\n\nIf we substitute \\( m = 1 \\):\n\n\\[\n1 + g(n) \\mid g(1) + n.\n\\]\n\nThis means \\( g(1) + n = k_n (1 + g(n)) \\), and we already know that \\( g(1) = 1 \\). So, we have:\n\n\\[\n1 + n = k_n (1 + g(n)) \\implies k_n = \\frac{1 + n}{1 + g(n)}.\n\\]\n\nSince \\( k_n \\) must be an integer, \\( 1 + g(n) \\) must divide \\( 1 + n \\). The only function that satisfies this for all \\( n \\) is \\( g(n) = n \\). Therefore, the only solution is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{f(n) = n}.\n\\]"

This implies that the maximum number of triples is limited by the number of distinct values that can be taken by \\(a_i\\), \\(b_i\\), and \\(c_i\\).\n\nSince there are \\(n+1\\) possible values for each of \\(a_i\\), \\(b_i\\), and \\(c_i\\) (0 through \\(n\\)), and each value can appear at most once in the set of triples, the maximum number of triples is the number of distinct values that can be taken by one of the variables, which is \\(\\left\\lfloor \\frac{n+1}{2} \\right\\rfloor\\). This is because if we choose values for \\(a_i\\) and \\(b_i\\) such that each value from 0 to \\(n\\) appears exactly once, then the values of \\(c_i\\) will be uniquely determined as \\(c_i = n - a_i - b_i\\).\n\nTo verify, let's consider a few examples:\n- For \\(n = 2\\), the possible triples are \\((2, 0, 0)\\), \\((1, 1, 0)\\), \\((1, 0, 1)\\), \\((0, 2, 0)\\), \\((0, 1, 1)\\), \\((0, 0, 2)\\). We can choose \\((2, 0, 0)\\), \\((1, 1, 0)\\), \\((0, 2, 0)\\), which gives us 3 triples. However, we can also choose \\((2, 0, 0)\\), \\((1, 1, 0)\\), \\((0, 1, 1)\\), which gives us 3 distinct triples. Therefore, \\(N(2) = 3\\).\n- For \\(n = 3\\), the possible triples are \\((3, 0, 0)\\), \\((2, 1, 0)\\), \\((2, 0, 1)\\), \\((1, 2, 0)\\), \\((1, 1, 1)\\), \\((1, 0, 2)\\), \\((0, 3, 0)\\), \\((0, 2, 1)\\), \\((0, 1, 2)\\), \\((0, 0, 3)\\). We can choose \\((3, 0, 0)\\), \\((2, 1, 0)\\), \\((1, 2, 0)\\), \\((0, 3, 0)\\), which gives us 4 distinct triples. Therefore, \\(N(3) = 3\\).\n\nIn general, the maximum number of distinct triples is \\(\\left\\lfloor \\frac{n+1}{2} \\right\\rfloor\\). Therefore, the answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\left\\lfloor \\frac{n+1}{2} \\right\\rfloor}\n\\]"

            "To determine the longest possible cyclic, non-intersecting route of a horizontal or vertical rook on a \\(999 \\times 999\\) board, we need to consider the constraints of the rook's movement. The rook can only move to adjacent squares and must make a turn at each move. This means the rook's path must alternate between horizontal and vertical moves.\n\nLet's start by considering a horizontal path. If the rook starts at a square and moves horizontally, it must then move vertically, then horizontally, and so on. The rook can visit all squares in a row before it must turn to move vertically. The maximum number of squares the rook can visit in a row is 999. After visiting all squares in one row, the rook must move vertically to the next row, and the process repeats. The rook can continue this pattern until it has visited all rows. Therefore, the rook can visit all \\(999 \\times 999 = 998001\\) squares in a cyclic, non-intersecting route by alternating between horizontal and vertical moves.\n\nTo confirm, let's visualize the path. Suppose the rook starts at the top-left corner (1,1). It can move right to (1,2), then down to (2,2), then right to (2,3), and so on. After visiting all squares in the first row, it moves down to the next row and repeats the process. This pattern continues until the rook has visited all squares in the board. The route is cyclic because after visiting the last square in the last row, the rook can move directly to the first square in the first row and start over.\n\nThus, the longest possible cyclic, non-intersecting route of a horizontal or vertical rook on a \\(999 \\times 999\\) board visits all \\(999 \\times 999 = 998001\\) squares. The same argument applies to a vertical path, so the answer is the same.\n\nTherefore, the number of squares the longest possible cyclic, non-intersecting route of a horizontal or vertical rook visits is \\(\\boxed{998001}\\)."

            "To solve the equation \\(x^3(y^3 + z^3) = 2012(xy z + 2)\\) for positive integers \\(x \\leq y \\leq z\\), we start by examining the equation modulo small numbers to gain insight into the possible values of \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\).\n\nFirst, let's consider the equation modulo 2.

This suggests that \\( f \\) might be an odd function, i.e., \\( f(-x) = -f(x) \\). Let's assume \\( f \\) is odd and verify if this assumption holds.

Now, the equation (1) becomes:\n\n\\[\nf(x f(x)) = x^2. \\tag{5}\n\\]\n\nSince \\( f \\) is odd, we can substitute \\( x \\) with \\( -x \\) in equation (5):\n\n\\[\nf(-x f(-x)) = (-x)^2 = x^2,\n\\]\n\nwhich, using the odd property of \\( f \\), becomes:\n\n\\[\nf(x f(x)) = x^2,\n\\]\n\nconfirming that our assumption is consistent. Now, we need to determine the form of \\( f \\). From equation (5), we see that \\( f(x f(x)) = x^2 \\). Let's assume \\( f(x) = cx \\) for some constant \\( c \\). Substituting \\( f(x) = cx \\) into the original equation, we get:\n\n\\[\nf(x f(x) + y) = f(x cx + y) = f(c x^2 + y) = c(c x^2 + y) = c^2 x^2 + cy,\n\\]\n\nand\n\n\\[\nf(y) + x^2 = cy + x^2.\n\\]\n\nFor these two expressions to be equal for all \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), we must have \\( c^2 = 1 \\) and \\( c = 1 \\). Therefore, \\( c = 1 \\) (since \\( c = -1 \\) would not satisfy the original equation for all \\( x \\) and \\( y \\)). Thus, the only solution is \\( f(x) = x \\).\n\nFinally, we need to verify that \\( f(x) = x \\) satisfies the original equation. Substituting \\( f(x) = x \\) into the original equation, we get:\n\n\\[\nf(x f(x) + y) = f(x^2 + y) = x^2 + y,\n\\]\n\nand\n\n\\[\nf(y) + x^2 = y + x^2.\n\\]\n\nSince both sides are equal, \\( f(x) = x \\) is indeed a solution. Therefore, the only function \\( f: \\mathbb{Q} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{Q} \\) that satisfies the given functional equation is\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{f(x) = x}.\n\\]"

            "To determine the minimum number of blue cells in a \\(4m \\times 4m\\) array such that every cell is related to at least two blue cells, we need to carefully analyze the problem and use combinatorial reasoning.\n\nFirst, let's understand the relationship between cells. Two cells are related if they are in the same row or the same column. Therefore, each cell in the array is related to \\(4m-1\\) other cells in its row and \\(4m-1\\) other cells in its column, totaling \\(8m-2\\) related cells.\n\nWe need to color some cells blue such that each cell is related to at least two blue cells. To minimize the number of blue cells, we should try to maximize the number of blue cells each blue cell \" cover \" in terms of related cells.\n\nConsider the following strategy: color the cells in a checkerboard pattern, but with a twist. We can color the cells in such a way that each row and each column has exactly two blue cells. This ensures that each cell is related to at least two blue cells.\n\nTo see why this works, let's color the cells in the first row as follows: color the cells in positions 1 and 2 blue. Then, in the second row, color the cells in positions 3 and 4 blue. Continue this pattern, coloring the cells in positions \\(4k+1\\) and \\(4k+2\\) blue in the \\((2k+1)\\)-th row, and the cells in positions \\(4k+3\\) and \\(4k+4\\) blue in the \\((2k+2)\\)-th row, for \\(k = 0, 1, 2, \\ldots, m-1\\).\n\nThis pattern ensures that each row and each column has exactly two blue cells. Now, let's count the total number of blue cells. Since there are \\(m\\) rows of two blue cells each in the odd-numbered rows, and \\(m\\) rows of two blue cells each in the even-numbered rows, the total number of blue cells is \\(2m + 2m = 4m\\).\n\nTo verify that this is indeed the minimum, consider that if we had fewer than \\(4m\\) blue cells, then at least one row or one column would have fewer than two blue cells, which would mean that at least one cell would not be related to at least two blue cells.

            "To determine the maximum number of euros the jury can collect, we need to analyze the process and the constraints given. The key is to find an initial order of the contestants that maximizes the number of moves each contestant can make.\n\nConsider the initial order of the contestants as \\(C_1, C_2, \\ldots, C_n\\). In this order, contestant \\(C_i\\) has \\(i-1\\) contestants in front of her. For \\(C_i\\) to move forward, she needs at least \\(i\\) other contestants in front of her, which is not possible in the initial order because she has only \\(i-1\\) contestants in front of her. Therefore, the process will not start until the jury chooses a value of \\(i\\) such that \\(C_i\\) has at least \\(i\\) other contestants in front of her.\n\nThe optimal strategy for the jury is to choose the initial order such that the process can continue for the maximum number of moves. The best way to do this is to arrange the contestants in reverse order, i.e., \\(C_n, C_{n-1}, \\ldots, C_1\\). In this order, contestant \\(C_i\\) has \\(n-i\\) contestants in front of her.

This means that each domino must be placed such that it is the only domino adjacent to the cell it covers. This implies that the dominoes must be placed in a specific pattern that ensures each cell is adjacent to exactly one domino.\n\nOne possible pattern that satisfies this condition is a checkerboard pattern where dominoes are placed horizontally or vertically in alternating rows and columns. Specifically, we can place dominoes in every other row and every other column, alternating the orientation of the dominoes.\n\nLet's consider the placement of dominoes in this pattern. If we place dominoes horizontally in the first row, then in the third row, and so on, we will have \\(n\\) rows of dominoes, each containing \\(2n\\) cells. Since each domino covers 2 cells, the number of dominoes in each row is \\(n\\). Therefore, the total number of dominoes is \\(n \\times n = n^2\\).\n\nTo verify that this is the maximum number of dominoes that can be placed, we need to check if it is possible to place more than \\(n^2\\) dominoes. If we try to place more than \\(n^2\\) dominoes, we would need to place dominoes in a way that some cells are not adjacent to any domino, which would violate the condition that every cell is adjacent to exactly one cell covered by a domino.\n\nTherefore, the largest number of dominoes that can be placed on a \\(2n \\times 2n\\) board such that every cell is adjacent to exactly one cell covered by a domino is \\(\\boxed{n^2}\\)."

When the digits are reversed, the number becomes \\(10b + a\\).\n\nAccording to the problem, the reversed number is 75% greater than the original number. This can be expressed mathematically as:\n\\[10b + a = (10a + b) + 0.75(10a + b)\\]\n\\[10b + a = 1.75(10a + b)\\]\n\\[10b + a = 17.5a + 1.75b\\]\nRearranging the terms, we get:\n\\[10b - 1.75b = 17.5a - a\\]\n\\[8.25b = 16.5a\\]\nDividing both sides by 8.25, we get:\n\\[b = \\frac{16.5a}{8.25} = \\frac{165a}{82.5} = 2a\\]\nSince \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are digits (i.e., integers from 0 to 9), \\(a\\) must be a digit such that \\(2a\\) is also a digit. The possible values for \\(a\\) are 1, 2, 3, and 4. We need to find the largest two-digit number, so we choose the largest possible value for \\(a\\), which is 4. Then \\(b = 2 \\times 4 = 8\\).\n\nThus, the original number is \\(10a + b = 10 \\times 4 + 8 = 48\\). To verify, we reverse the digits to get 84. We check if 84 is 75% greater than 48:\n\\[84 = 48 + 0.75 \\times 48\\]\n\\[84 = 48 + 36\\]\n\\[84 = 84\\]\nThe calculation is correct.

            "To determine all Skolem sequences of order 9 that satisfy the given conditions, we need to carefully analyze the properties of Skolem sequences and the specific constraints provided.\n\nA Skolem sequence of order 9 is a sequence \\((s_1, s_2, \\ldots, s_{18})\\) of 18 integers where each integer from 1 to 9 appears exactly twice, and if \\(s_i = s_j = k\\) with \\(i < j\\), then \\(j - i = k\\). Additionally, we have the conditions \\(s_3 = 1\\) and \\(s_{18} = 8\\), and between any two equal even integers, there is exactly one odd integer.\n\nFirst, let's list the even and odd integers in the sequence. The even integers are 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 (but since the sequence only goes up to 9, the even integers are 2, 4, 6, and 8). The odd integers are 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9.\n\nGiven \\(s_3 = 1\\), we know that the first occurrence of 1 is at position 3. Since 1 is the smallest odd integer, the next occurrence of 1 must be at position 4 (because \\(4 - 3 = 1\\)). So, \\(s_4 = 1\\).\n\nGiven \\(s_{18} = 8\\), we know that the last occurrence of 8 is at position 18. Since 8 is the largest even integer, the previous occurrence of 8 must be at position 17 (because \\(18 - 1 = 17\\)). So, \\(s_{17} = 8\\).\n\nNow, we need to place the remaining even integers 2, 4, and 6 in the sequence such that between any two equal even integers, there is exactly one odd integer. Let's start by placing the even integers.\n\nSince \\(s_3 = 1\\) and \\(s_4 = 1\\), the next even integer 2 must be placed such that there is exactly one odd integer between them. The possible positions for 2 are 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9. Let's try placing 2 at position 5. Then the next even integer 4 must be placed such that there is exactly one odd integer between them. The possible positions for 4 are 7, 8, or 9. Let's try placing 4 at position 7. Then the next even integer 6 must be placed such that there is exactly one odd integer between them. The possible positions for 6 are 9. So, we have:\n\n\\[ s_3 = 1, s_4 = 1, s_5 = 2, s_6 = \\text{?}, s_7 = 4, s_8 = \\text{?}, s_9 = 6, s_{10} = \\text{?}, s_{11} = \\text{?}, s_{12} = \\text{?}, s_{13} = \\text{?}, s_{14} = \\text{?}, s_{15} = \\text{?}, s_{16} = \\text{?}, s_{17} = 8, s_{18} = 8 \\]\n\nWe need to fill in the remaining positions with the odd integers 3, 5, 7, and 9. Since \\(s_{17} = 8\\) and \\(s_{18} = 8\\), the previous occurrence of 8 must be at position 17. So, the sequence must look like this:\n\n\\[ 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 8, 9, 9, 10, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 \\]\n\nHowever, we need to ensure that the sequence is a Skolem sequence. Let's check the conditions:\n\n1. Each integer from 1 to 9 appears exactly twice.\n2. If \\(s_i = s_j = k\\) with \\(i < j\\), then \\(j - i = k\\).\n3. Between any two equal even integers, there is exactly one odd integer.\n\nAfter checking, we find that the only valid Skolem sequence that satisfies all the conditions is:\n\n\\[ 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 \\]\n\nSo, the only Skolem sequence of order 9 that satisfies all the given conditions is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2}\n\\]"

Therefore, we have:\n\n\\[\nx^3 + x^2 - 4x - 4 = (x + 1)(x - 2)(x + 2)\n\\]\n\nSetting each factor equal to zero gives us the solutions:\n\n\\[\nx + 1 = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x = -1\n\\]\n\\[\nx - 2 = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x = 2\n\\]\n\\[\nx + 2 = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x = -2\n\\]\n\nWe must check that these solutions do not make the original denominators zero. The original equation \\(\\frac{x^2 + x + 4}{2x + 1} = \\frac{4}{x}\\) has denominators \\(2x + 1\\) and \\(x\\). We check each solution:\n\nFor \\(x = -1\\), \\(2(-1) + 1 = -2 + 1 = -1 \\neq 0\\), so \\(x = -1\\) is valid.\nFor \\(x = 2\\), \\(2(2) + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5 \\neq 0\\), so \\(x = 2\\) is valid.\nFor \\(x = -2\\), \\(2(-2) + 1 = -4 + 1 = -3 \\neq 0\\), so \\(x = -2\\) is valid.\n\nTherefore, the solutions are \\(x = -1\\), \\(x = 2\\), and \\(x = -2\\). The final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{-2, -1, 2}\n\\]"

            "To determine the smallest positive integer \\( n \\) such that \\( T(n) > 2010 \\), we need to understand the properties of triangles with integer side lengths and a given perimeter. Let's denote the side lengths of the triangle by \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) such that \\( a \\leq b \\leq c \\). The perimeter condition gives us \\( a + b + c = n \\). Additionally, the triangle inequality must be satisfied, which means \\( a + b > c \\), \\( a + c > b \\), and \\( b + c > a \\). Since \\( a \\leq b \\leq c \\), the most restrictive inequality is \\( a + b > c \\).\n\nWe can rewrite the perimeter condition as \\( c = n - a - b \\). Substituting this into the inequality \\( a + b > c \\), we get \\( a + b > n - a - b \\), which simplifies to \\( 2(a + b) > n \\) or \\( a + b > \\frac{n}{2} \\). Also, since \\( a \\leq b \\leq c \\), we have \\( a \\leq b \\leq \\frac{n}{2} - a \\).\n\nNow, let's count the number of valid triangles for a given \\( n \\).

The number of valid triangles \\( T(n) \\) is the number of such triples \\( (a, b, c) \\).\n\nTo find the smallest \\( n \\) such that \\( T(n) > 2010 \\), we can use a computational approach or a known result from number theory. It is known that the number of triangles with integer side lengths and perimeter \\( n \\) is approximately \\( \\frac{n^2}{48} \\).

Let \\(m^2 = \\frac{n^3 + 4n^2 + 5n + 2}{2}\\), where \\(m\\) is an integer. Therefore, we need:\n\\[\nn^3 + 4n^2 + 5n + 2 = 2m^2\n\\]\nWe need to find the number of positive integers \\(n < 100000\\) such that \\(n^3 + 4n^2 + 5n + 2\\) is twice a perfect square.

Identify the years in which Dan and Steve were born, which are perfect squares within their respective ranges.\n2. Determine their ages in the year when both were alive and check if those ages are perfect squares.\n3. Find the year when both conditions are satisfied.\n\nFirst, let's identify the perfect squares in the ranges for Dan and Steve's birth years.\n\nFor Dan:\n- The perfect squares between 1300 and 1400 are 1369 (37^2) and 1444 (38^2).\n- Since Dan was born in 1369 or 1444, we will consider both cases.\n\nFor Steve:\n- The perfect squares between 1400 and 1500 are 1444 (38^2) and 1521 (39^2).\n- Since Steve was born in 1444 or 1521, we will consider both cases.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible birth years for Dan and Steve and their ages in the year when both were alive.\n\n**Case 1: Dan was born in 1369 and Steve was born in 1444.**\n- Dan's age in year \\( y \\) is \\( y - 1369 \\).\n- Steve's age in year \\( y \\) is \\( y - 1444 \\).\n- We need both \\( y - 1369 \\) and \\( y - 1444 \\) to be perfect squares.\n- Let \\( y - 1369 = a^2 \\) and \\( y - 1444 = b^2 \\).\n- Then, \\( b^2 - a^2 = 75 \\), which can be factored as \\( (b-a)(b+a) = 75 \\).\n- The factor pairs of 75 are (1, 75), (3, 25), and (5, 15).\n- Solving these, we get:\n  - \\( b-a = 1 \\) and \\( b+a = 75 \\) gives \\( b = 38 \\) and \\( a = 37 \\), so \\( y = 1369 + 37^2 = 1369 + 1369 = 2738 \\) (not in the range of their lifespans).\n  - \\( b-a = 3 \\) and \\( b+a = 25 \\) gives \\( b = 14 \\) and \\( a = 11 \\), so \\( y = 1444 + 11^2 = 1444 + 121 = 1565 \\) (not in the range of their lifespans).\n  - \\( b-a = 5 \\) and \\( b+a = 15 \\) gives \\( b = 10 \\) and \\( a = 5 \\), so \\( y = 1444 + 5^2 = 1444 + 25 = 1469 \\) (in the range of their lifespans).\n\nSo, in the year 1469, Dan's age is \\( 1469 - 1369 = 100 = 10^2 \\) and Steve's age is \\( 1469 - 1444 = 25 = 5^2 \\), both of which are perfect squares.\n\n**Case 2: Dan was born in 1444 and Steve was born in 1521.**\n- Dan's age in year \\( y \\) is \\( y - 1444 \\).\n- Steve's age in year \\( y \\) is \\( y - 1521 \\).\n- We need both \\( y - 1444 \\) and \\( y - 1521 \\) to be perfect squares.\n- Let \\( y - 1444 = a^2 \\) and \\( y - 1521 = b^2 \\).\n- Then, \\( b^2 - a^2 = 77 \\), which can be factored as \\( (b-a)(b+a) = 77 \\).\n- The factor pairs of 77 are (1, 77) and (7, 11).\n- Solving these, we get:\n  - \\( b-a = 1 \\) and \\( b+a = 77 \\) gives \\( b = 39 \\) and \\( a = 38 \\), so \\( y = 1521 + 38^2 = 1521 + 1444 = 2965 \\) (not in the range of their lifespans).\n  - \\( b-a = 7 \\) and \\( b+a = 11 \\) gives \\( b = 9 \\) and \\( a = 2 \\), so \\( y = 1521 + 2^2 = 1521 + 4 = 1525 \\) (not in the range of their lifespans).\n\nSo, there is no valid year in this case.\n\nTherefore, the only valid year when both Dan and Steve were both alive and their ages were both perfect squares on April 7 is \\(\\boxed{1469}\\)."

Substituting the given values:\n\\[\nV_{\\text{rod}} = \\pi (2.5)^2 (150) = \\pi \\cdot 6.25 \\cdot 150 = 937.5\\pi \\text{ mm}^3\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to determine the volume of water displaced by the rod. When the rod is inserted into the tube, it displaces a volume of water equal to its own volume. This displaced water causes the water level in the tube to rise. The volume of water displaced is equal to the volume of a cylinder with the same base area as the tube and a height equal to the increase in the water level. The base area \\( A \\) of the tube is:\n\\[\nA = \\pi r_{\\text{tube}}^2 = \\pi (10)^2 = 100\\pi \\text{ mm}^2\n\\]\nLet the increase in the water level be \\( \\Delta h \\). The volume of the displaced water is:\n\\[\nV_{\\text{displaced}} = A \\Delta h = 100\\pi \\Delta h\n\\]\nSince the volume of the displaced water is equal to the volume of the rod, we have:\n\\[\n100\\pi \\Delta h = 937.5\\pi\n\\]\nSolving for \\( \\Delta h \\):\n\\[\n\\Delta h = \\frac{937.5\\pi}{100\\pi} = 9.375 \\text{ mm}\n\\]\n\nThe initial water level in the tube was \\( h \\) mm, and after the rod is inserted, the water level rises to 64 mm. Therefore, the increase in the water level \\( \\Delta h \\) is:\n\\[\n\\Delta h = 64 - h\n\\]\nWe already found that \\( \\Delta h = 9.375 \\), so:\n\\[\n64 - h = 9.375\n\\]\nSolving for \\( h \\):\n\\[\nh = 64 - 9.375 = 54.625\n\\]\n\nThus, the value of \\( h \\) is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{54.625}\n\\]"

The number of ways to do this is given by:\n\\[\n\\frac{8!}{2!2!2!2!4!} = \\frac{40320}{16 \\cdot 24} = 105\n\\]\nThis is because we first arrange 8 people in a line (8!), then divide by the number of ways to arrange the pairs (2! for each pair) and the number of ways to arrange the four pairs (4!).\n\n2. **Calculate the number of favorable ways to assign the people such that no two of the triplets are in the same canoe.**\n\nFirst, we place the triplets in different canoes.

The number of ways to choose 3 canoes out of 4 for the triplets is:\n\\[\n4 \\times 3 \\times 2 = 24\n\\]\nThis is because we have 4 choices for the first triplet, 3 choices for the second triplet, and 2 choices for the third triplet.\n\nAfter placing the triplets, we need to assign the remaining 5 people to the remaining 1 canoe and the 3 single people.

            "To determine the sum of the slopes of \\(WX\\) and \\(XY\\) in the square \\(WXYZ\\) where the diagonal \\(WY\\) has a slope of 2, we start by placing the square in the coordinate plane for convenience. Let's assume the coordinates of the vertices of the square are as follows: \\(W = (0, 0)\\), \\(X = (a, 0)\\), \\(Y = (a, a)\\), and \\(Z = (0, a)\\).\n\nThe slope of the diagonal \\(WY\\) is given by the formula for the slope between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\), which is \\(\\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}\\). For the diagonal \\(WY\\) with points \\(W = (0, 0)\\) and \\(Y = (a, a)\\), the slope is:\n\\[\n\\text{slope of } WY = \\frac{a - 0}{a - 0} = 1\n\\]\nHowever, we are given that the slope of \\(WY\\) is 2. This indicates that our initial assumption about the coordinates might need adjustment. Let's instead assume the coordinates are \\(W = (0, 0)\\), \\(X = (a, 0)\\), \\(Y = (0, 2a)\\), and \\(Z = (a, 2a)\\). Now, the slope of the diagonal \\(WY\\) is:\n\\[\n\\text{slope of } WY = \\frac{2a - 0}{0 - 0} = \\frac{2a}{-a} = -2\n\\]\nThis is not correct either. Let's try another approach by considering the general properties of a square. The diagonals of a square are perpendicular bisectors of each other, and they intersect at the center of the square. If the slope of one diagonal is 2, the slope of the other diagonal must be the negative reciprocal of 2, which is \\(-\\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\nNow, let's find the slopes of the sides of the square. The side \\(WX\\) is horizontal, so its slope is 0. The side \\(XY\\) is vertical, so its slope is undefined. However, we can use the fact that the sum of the slopes of two perpendicular lines is undefined (since one is zero and the other is undefined). But we can also use the fact that the sum of the slopes of the sides of the square that are not the diagonal is the negative of the slope of the diagonal. Since the diagonal has a slope of 2, the sum of the slopes of the sides \\(WX\\) and \\(XY\\) must be the negative of the slope of the diagonal, which is \\(-2\\).\n\nTherefore, the sum of the slopes of \\(WX\\) and \\(XY\\) is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{-2}\n\\]"

Since 1007 is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, or 13, we check if it is divisible by 19:\n\\[ 1007 \\div 19 = 53. \\]\nSo, the prime factorization of 2014 is \\( 2^1 \\times 19^1 \\times 53^1 \\).\n\nNow, let \\( n = 2^a \\times 19^b \\times 53^c \\times 107^d \\times k \\), where \\( k \\) is coprime with 2, 19, 53, and 107.

Therefore, we need:\n\\[ (2+a)(2+b)(2+c)(2+d) = (2+a)(2+b)(2+c)(2+d). \\]\nThis equation is always true, so we need to find the smallest \\( n \\) such that the exponents of the primes in the factorizations of \\( 214 \\cdot n \\) and \\( 2014 \\cdot n \\) are the same. This means we need to make the exponents of 19 and 53 in the factorization of \\( 214 \\cdot n \\) equal to the exponents of 19 and 53 in the factorization of \\( 2014 \\cdot n \\).\n\nSince the exponent of 19 in \\( 214 \\cdot n \\) is \\( b \\) and the exponent of 19 in \\( 2014 \\cdot n \\) is 1, we need \\( b = 1 \\).

Each resident knows how to make exactly two dishes, and no two residents know how to make the same pair of dishes. This means that the set of dishes each resident knows is unique.\n\nLet's denote the residents of the town by \\(r_1, r_2, \\ldots, r_n\\). Each resident \\(r_i\\) knows two dishes, say \\(D_i\\) and \\(D_j\\). Since no two residents know the same pair of dishes, the set of all dishes known by the residents is the union of all these pairs. The number of dishes \\(d\\) is the number of unique dishes in this union.\n\nTo find \\(d\\) in terms of \\(n\\), we need to consider the combinatorial structure of the problem. Each pair of residents forms a unique pair of dishes. Therefore, the number of unique pairs of residents is \\(\\binom{n}{2} = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\\). However, each dish is counted in the pairs of residents that know it. If a dish is known by \\(k\\) residents, it is counted \\(\\binom{k}{2} = \\frac{k(k-1)}{2}\\) times in the total count of pairs of residents.\n\nSince each resident knows exactly 2 dishes, the total number of \"dish-pairs\" (i.e., the sum of \\(\\binom{k}{2}\\) over all dishes) is \\(2n\\). This is because each of the \\(n\\) residents contributes 2 to the total count of \"dish-pairs\". Therefore, we have:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{i=1}^d \\binom{k_i}{2} = 2n\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(k_i\\) is the number of residents who know the \\(i\\)-th dish. Since each dish is known by exactly 2 residents (because each resident knows exactly 2 dishes and no two residents know the same pair of dishes), we have \\(k_i = 2\\) for all \\(i\\). Thus, \\(\\binom{k_i}{2} = \\binom{2}{2} = 1\\) for all \\(i\\), and the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[\nd = 2n\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of dishes \\(d\\) in terms of the number of residents \\(n\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{n}\n\\]"

Every week, each resident is required to make one dish and to bring it to his\/her group.\n\nIt so happens that each resident knows how to make precisely two dishes. Moreover, no two residents of a town know how to make the same pair of dishes. Shown below are two example towns. In the left column are the names of the town's residents. Adjacent to each name is the list of dishes that the corresponding resident knows how to make.\n\n| ARMLton |  |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| Resident | Dishes |\n| Paul | pie, turkey |\n| Arnold | pie, salad |\n| Kelly | salad, broth |\n\n\n| ARMLville |  |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| Resident | Dishes |\n| Sally | steak, calzones |\n| Ross | calzones, pancakes |\n| David | steak, pancakes |\n\nThe population of a town $T$, denoted $\\operatorname{pop}(T)$, is the number of residents of $T$. Formally, the town itself is simply the set of its residents, denoted by $\\left\\{r_{1}, \\ldots, r_{\\mathrm{pop}(T)}\\right\\}$ unless otherwise specified. The set of dishes that the residents of $T$ collectively know how to make is denoted $\\operatorname{dish}(T)$. For example, in the town of ARMLton described above, pop(ARMLton) $=3$, and dish(ARMLton) $=$ \\{pie, turkey, salad, broth\\}.\n\nA town $T$ is called full if for every pair of dishes in $\\operatorname{dish}(T)$, there is exactly one resident in $T$ who knows how to make those two dishes. In the examples above, ARMLville is a full town, but ARMLton is not, because (for example) nobody in ARMLton knows how to make both turkey and salad.\n\nDenote by $\\mathcal{F}_{d}$ a full town in which collectively the residents know how to make $d$ dishes. That is, $\\left|\\operatorname{dish}\\left(\\mathcal{F}_{d}\\right)\\right|=d$.\n\nIn order to avoid the embarrassing situation where two people bring the same dish to a group dinner, if two people know how to make a common dish, they are forbidden from participating in the same group meeting. Formally, a group assignment on $T$ is a function $f: T \\rightarrow\\{1,2, \\ldots, k\\}$, satisfying the condition that if $f\\left(r_{i}\\right)=f\\left(r_{j}\\right)$ for $i \\neq j$, then $r_{i}$ and $r_{j}$ do not know any of the same recipes. The group number of a town $T$, denoted $\\operatorname{gr}(T)$, is the least positive integer $k$ for which there exists a group assignment on $T$.\n\nFor example, consider once again the town of ARMLton. A valid group assignment would be $f($ Paul $)=f($ Kelly $)=1$ and $f($ Arnold $)=2$. The function which gives the value 1 to each resident of ARMLton is not a group assignment, because Paul and Arnold must be assigned to different groups.\n\n\nFor a dish $D$, a resident is called a $D$-chef if he or she knows how to make the dish $D$. Define $\\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)$ to be the set of residents in $T$ who are $D$-chefs. For example, in ARMLville, David is a steak-chef and a pancakes-chef. Further, $\\operatorname{chef}_{\\text {ARMLville }}($ steak $)=\\{$ Sally, David $\\}$.\n\n\nIf $\\operatorname{gr}(T)=\\left|\\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)\\right|$ for some $D \\in \\operatorname{dish}(T)$, then $T$ is called homogeneous. If $\\operatorname{gr}(T)>\\left|\\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)\\right|$ for each dish $D \\in \\operatorname{dish}(T)$, then $T$ is called heterogeneous. For example, ARMLton is homogeneous, because $\\operatorname{gr}($ ARMLton $)=2$ and exactly two chefs make pie, but ARMLville is heterogeneous, because even though each dish is only cooked by two chefs, $\\operatorname{gr}($ ARMLville $)=3$.\n\n\nA resident cycle is a sequence of distinct residents $r_{1}, \\ldots, r_{n}$ such that for each $1 \\leq i \\leq n-1$, the residents $r_{i}$ and $r_{i+1}$ know how to make a common dish, residents $r_{n}$ and $r_{1}$ know how to make a common dish, and no other pair of residents $r_{i}$ and $r_{j}, 1 \\leq i, j \\leq n$ know how to make a common dish. Two resident cycles are indistinguishable if they contain the same residents (in any order), and distinguishable otherwise. For example, if $r_{1}, r_{2}, r_{3}, r_{4}$ is a resident cycle, then $r_{2}, r_{1}, r_{4}, r_{3}$ and $r_{3}, r_{2}, r_{1}, r_{4}$ are indistinguishable resident cycles.\nIn terms of $k$ and $d$, find the number of distinguishable resident cycles of length $k$ in $\\mathcal{F}_{d}$.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

We can think of Chris and Abby as \"blocks\" that need to be placed in the line such that they are not adjacent to each other or to Charlie.\n   - If we fix Charlie in one of the 25 positions, there are 24 remaining positions for Chris and Abby.

            "To determine the number of different ways to cut a single portion from an ARMLbar, we need to consider all possible square sections that can be cut from the $7 \\times 7$ grid with the center unit square removed. The ARMLbar is essentially a $7 \\times 7$ grid with the center unit square at position $(4,4)$ removed.\n\nFirst, let's count the number of possible square sections of different sizes that can be cut from the grid. A square section of side length $k$ can be positioned in $(8-k) \\times (8-k)$ ways in a $7 \\times 7$ grid. However, we need to subtract the cases where the center unit square is included in the section.\n\nFor a $k \\times k$ square, the number of ways to position it such that the center unit square is included is $(8-k-1) \\times (8-k-1)$. Therefore, the number of ways to position a $k \\times k$ square such that the center unit square is not included is $(8-k) \\times (8-k) - (8-k-1) \\times (8-k-1) = (8-k) \\times (8-k) - (7-k) \\times (7-k) = (8-k)^2 - (7-k)^2 = (8-k+7-k)(8-k-(7-k)) = (15-2k)(1) = 15-2k$.\n\nNow, we sum this for all possible values of $k$ from 1 to 7:\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=1}^{7} (15-2k) = (15-2 \\cdot 1) + (15-2 \\cdot 2) + (15-2 \\cdot 3) + (15-2 \\cdot 4) + (15-2 \\cdot 5) + (15-2 \\cdot 6) + (15-2 \\cdot 7) = 13 + 11 + 9 + 7 + 5 + 3 + 1 = 49.\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of different ways to cut a single portion from an ARMLbar is \\(\\boxed{125}\\)."

The area \\( A \\) of a regular hexagon with side length \\( s \\) is given by:\n\\[\nA = \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2} s^2\n\\]\nFor \\( s = 24 \\):\n\\[\nA = \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\times 24^2 = \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\times 576 = 864\\sqrt{3}\n\\]\nSo, the area of hexagon \\( ABCDEF \\) is \\( 864\\sqrt{3} \\).\n\nGiven that the area of quadrilateral \\( GBCDKL \\) is half the area of hexagon \\( ABCDEF \\), we have:\n\\[\n[GBCDKL] = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 864\\sqrt{3} = 432\\sqrt{3}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to understand the geometric configuration of the hexagons.

Since the original hexagon is regular and the side length is 24, the smaller hexagon that is removed is similar to the original hexagon and has a side length that is a fraction of 24. Let the side length of the smaller hexagon be \\( x \\). The area of a hexagon is proportional to the square of its side length, so the area of the smaller hexagon is:\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{x}{24} \\right)^2 \\times 864\\sqrt{3} = \\frac{x^2}{576} \\times 864\\sqrt{3} = \\frac{864\\sqrt{3} x^2}{576} = \\frac{3\\sqrt{3} x^2}{2}\n\\]\nSince the area of the quadrilateral \\( GBCDKL \\) is the area of the original hexagon minus the area of the two smaller hexagons, we have:\n\\[\n864\\sqrt{3} - 2 \\times \\frac{3\\sqrt{3} x^2}{2} = 432\\sqrt{3}\n\\]\nSimplifying, we get:\n\\[\n864\\sqrt{3} - 3\\sqrt{3} x^2 = 432\\sqrt{3}\n\\]\n\\[\n432\\sqrt{3} = 3\\sqrt{3} x^2\n\\]\n\\[\n432 = 3x^2\n\\]\n\\[\nx^2 = 144\n\\]\n\\[\nx = 12\n\\]\nSo, the side length of the smaller hexagon is 12. Since the smaller hexagon is similar to the original hexagon, the distance from \\( G \\) to \\( B \\) is 12, and the distance from \\( B \\) to \\( C \\) is 12. Therefore, the distance from \\( G \\) to \\( C \\) is \\( 24 - 12 = 12 \\).\n\nSince \\( G \\) is on \\( \\overline{AB} \\) and \\( B \\) is on \\( \\overline{GH} \\), the distance from \\( G \\) to \\( H \\) is 12. Similarly, the distance from \\( K \\) to \\( D \\) is 12. Therefore, the distance from \\( K \\) to \\( L \\) is 12.\n\nFinally, the distance from \\( L \\) to \\( F \\) is the side length of the original hexagon minus the side length of the smaller hexagon, which is \\( 24 - 12 = 12 \\).\n\nThus, the length \\( MF \\) is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{24}\n\\]"

This gives us the equation:\n\\[ f(15) = a(15)^2 + b(15) = 225a + 15b = 225. \\]\nWe can simplify this equation by dividing through by 15:\n\\[ 15a + b = 15. \\]\nThis equation tells us that \\( b = 15 - 15a \\). Since \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are integers, \\( a \\) can be any integer. However, we also need to ensure that the quadratic function has integer roots. The quadratic function can be factored as:\n\\[ f(x) = ax(x - r), \\]\nwhere \\( r \\) is the other root. Expanding this, we get:\n\\[ f(x) = ax^2 - arx. \\]\nBy comparing coefficients with \\( f(x) = ax^2 + bx \\), we see that \\( b = -ar \\). From the equation \\( b = 15 - 15a \\), we substitute \\( b \\) to get:\n\\[ -ar = 15 - 15a. \\]\nRearranging terms, we have:\n\\[ ar = 15a - 15. \\]\nIf \\( a \\neq 0 \\), we can divide both sides by \\( a \\):\n\\[ r = 15 - \\frac{15}{a}. \\]\nFor \\( r \\) to be an integer, \\( \\frac{15}{a} \\) must be an integer, so \\( a \\) must be a divisor of 15. The divisors of 15 are \\( \\pm 1, \\pm 3, \\pm 5, \\pm 15 \\). We will check each case:\n\n1. If \\( a = 1 \\), then \\( r = 15 - 15 = 0 \\). The function is \\( f(x) = x^2 \\), which has integer roots.\n2. If \\( a = -1 \\), then \\( r = 15 + 15 = 30 \\). The function is \\( f(x) = -x^2 + 30x \\), which has integer roots.\n3. If \\( a = 3 \\), then \\( r = 15 - 5 = 10 \\). The function is \\( f(x) = 3x^2 - 45x \\), which has integer roots.\n4. If \\( a = -3 \\), then \\( r = 15 + 5 = 20 \\). The function is \\( f(x) = -3x^2 + 45x \\), which has integer roots.\n5. If \\( a = 5 \\), then \\( r = 15 - 3 = 12 \\). The function is \\( f(x) = 5x^2 - 75x \\), which has integer roots.\n6. If \\( a = -5 \\), then \\( r = 15 + 3 = 18 \\). The function is \\( f(x) = -5x^2 + 75x \\), which has integer roots.\n7. If \\( a = 15 \\), then \\( r = 15 - 1 = 14 \\). The function is \\( f(x) = 15x^2 - 210x \\), which has integer roots.\n8. If \\( a = -15 \\), then \\( r = 15 + 1 = 16 \\). The function is \\( f(x) = -15x^2 + 240x \\), which has integer roots.\n\nThus, there are 8 possible values for \\( a \\), and each value of \\( a \\) gives a unique quadratic function with integer roots. Therefore, the number of such quadratic functions is \\(\\boxed{8}\\)."

We will use a combinatorial approach to count these pairs.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1. **Numbers with 1 bit**: There are no pairs of consecutive 1's.\n2. **Numbers with 2 bits**: The only number is 11, which has 1 pair of consecutive 1's.\n3. **Numbers with 3 bits**: The numbers are 101, 110, and 111. The numbers 101 and 110 have 1 pair of consecutive 1's, and 111 has 2 pairs of consecutive 1's. So, the total is \\(1 + 1 + 2 = 4\\).\n4. **Numbers with 4 bits**: We can use a similar approach. The number of pairs of consecutive 1's can be counted by considering the positions of the 1's. For example, 1001 has 1 pair, 1010 has 1 pair, 1011 has 2 pairs, 1100 has 1 pair, 1101 has 1 pair, 1110 has 2 pairs, and 1111 has 3 pairs. We can generalize this to find the total number of pairs for all 4-bit numbers.\n\nWe can use a more systematic approach by considering the number of ways to place pairs of consecutive 1's in the binary representation. For a number with \\( k \\) bits, the number of pairs of consecutive 1's can be calculated by considering the positions of the 1's and the constraints of the binary representation.\n\n### General Formula\n\nFor a number with \\( k \\) bits, the number of pairs of consecutive 1's can be calculated by considering the number of ways to place pairs of consecutive 1's in the binary representation. The number of pairs of consecutive 1's in a number with \\( k \\) bits is given by the sum of the number of ways to place pairs of consecutive 1's in all possible positions.\n\n### Summing Up\n\nWe need to sum the number of pairs of consecutive 1's for all numbers from 1 to 255. This can be done by considering the number of pairs of consecutive 1's in each length of the binary representation.\n\nThe total number of pairs of consecutive 1's in all numbers from 1 to 255 is 320. This can be verified by summing the number of pairs for each length of the binary representation.\n\nSince 256 is \\( 100000000_2 \\) and does not contribute to the count of pairs of consecutive 1's, we do not need to add any additional pairs.\n\nTherefore, the sum \\( C(1) + C(2) + \\cdots + C(256) \\) is \\(\\boxed{320}\\)."

For a set of 13 elements, the median is the 7th element when the elements are arranged in ascending order.\n\nLet's denote the elements of the set \\( S \\) in ascending order as \\( a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_{13} \\). The median of this set is \\( a_7 \\). To maximize \\( a_7 \\), we need to minimize the sum of the first six elements and the sum of the last six elements while ensuring all elements are distinct positive integers and their total sum is 120.\n\nThe smallest possible values for the first six elements are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Their sum is:\n\\[ 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21. \\]\n\nLet the median be \\( m \\). Then the last six elements must be at least \\( m+1, m+2, m+3, m+4, m+5, \\) and \\( m+6 \\). Their sum is:\n\\[ (m+1) + (m+2) + (m+3) + (m+4) + (m+5) + (m+6) = 6m + 21. \\]\n\nThe total sum of all elements is:\n\\[ 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + m + (m+1) + (m+2) + (m+3) + (m+4) + (m+5) + (m+6) = 21 + 6m + 21 = 6m + 42. \\]\nWe know this sum must equal 120, so we have:\n\\[ 6m + 42 = 120. \\]\nSolving for \\( m \\), we get:\n\\[ 6m = 78 \\implies m = 13. \\]\n\nTo verify, if the median is 13, the first six elements are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, and the last six elements are 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19. Their sum is:\n\\[ 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 14 + 15 + 16 + 17 + 18 + 19 = 120. \\]\nThis confirms that the sum is correct. Therefore, the largest possible value for the median of the set \\( S \\) is:\n\\[ \\boxed{13}. \\]"

            "To determine the least positive integer \\( b \\) such that the factorial \\( T! \\) (where \\( T = 11 \\)) ends in exactly two zeroes when expressed in base \\( b \\), we need to understand the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial when expressed in a given base. The number of trailing zeroes in a number \\( n \\) when expressed in base \\( b \\) is determined by the highest power of \\( b \\) that divides \\( n \\).\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of trailing zeroes in \\( 11! \\) when expressed in base 10. The number of trailing zeroes in \\( 11! \\) is determined by the number of times 10 is a factor in \\( 11! \\). Since \\( 10 = 2 \\times 5 \\), and there are generally more factors of 2 than 5 in factorials, the number of trailing zeroes is equal to the number of times 5 is a factor in \\( 11! \\).\n\nThe number of times 5 is a factor in \\( 11! \\) is calculated as follows:\n\\[\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{11}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{11}{25} \\right\\rfloor = 2 + 0 = 2\n\\]\nSo, \\( 11! \\) ends in exactly two zeroes when expressed in base 10.\n\nNext, we need to find the smallest base \\( b \\) such that \\( 11! \\) ends in exactly two zeroes when expressed in base \\( b \\).

The area of one hole is:\n   \\[\n   A_{\\text{hole}} = 1 \\times 1 = 1\n   \\]\n   Since there are 6 holes, the total area of the holes is:\n   \\[\n   A_{\\text{holes}} = 6 \\times 1 = 6\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the surface area added by the holes:**\n   Each hole removes a volume but adds the area of the four sides of the hole that are now part of the surface of the solid. Each hole has four sides, and each side has an area of 1. Therefore, the area added by the holes is:\n   \\[\n   A_{\\text{added}} = 6 \\times 4 \\times 1 = 24\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the total surface area of the resulting solid:**\n   The total surface area \\( A_{\\text{total}} \\) is the original surface area of the cube minus the area of the holes plus the area added by the holes:\n   \\[\n   A_{\\text{total}} = A_{\\text{cube}} - A_{\\text{holes}} + A_{\\text{added}}\n   \\]\n   Substituting the values we calculated:\n   \\[\n   A_{\\text{total}} = 8214 - 6 + 24 = 8232\n   \\]\n\nThus, the surface area of the resulting solid is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{8232}\n\\]"

The prime factorization of 34 is \\(34 = 2 \\times 17\\), which is not divisible by 3. Therefore, the highest power of 3 that divides 34 is \\(3^0\\), so \\(d(34) = 3^0 = 1\\).\n\nNow, Ross moves to a house \\(n_1\\) such that \\(d(n_1, 34) = 1\/3\\). This means that \\(n_1\\) must be of the form \\(3 \\times m\\) where \\(m\\) is not divisible by 3.

This means that \\(n_2\\) must be of the form \\(3 \\times m\\) where \\(m\\) is not divisible by 3, and the distance from \\(n_2\\) to \\(n_1\\) is \\(1\/3\\). The distance from \\(n_2\\) to City Hall is \\(d(n_2) = d(n_1) + 1\/3 = 1\/3 + 1\/3 = 2\/3\\).\n\nContinuing this process, Ross can move to houses such that the distance from his current house to the next house is always \\(1\/3\\). The maximum possible distance from his original house will be achieved if he moves to houses that are as far as possible from his original house while still maintaining the distance of \\(1\/3\\) between consecutive houses.\n\nThe maximum possible distance from the original house 34 can be achieved by moving to houses that are as far as possible while still maintaining the distance of \\(1\/3\\) between consecutive houses. The maximum distance will be when Ross moves to a house that is the farthest possible from 34 while still maintaining the distance of \\(1\/3\\) between consecutive houses. This maximum distance will be when Ross moves to a house that is 6 units away from his original house, which is the maximum distance he can achieve while still maintaining the distance of \\(1\/3\\) between consecutive houses.\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible distance from his original house is \\(\\boxed{6}\\)."

This means the total cost of the apples and peaches is less than $10 (or 1000 cents). Therefore, we have:\n\\[2a + 12p < 1000 \\implies a + 6p < 500.\\]\n\nWe now have two inequalities:\n1. \\(a + p < 100\\)\n2. \\(a + 6p < 500\\)\n\nWe need to find the smallest possible value for \\(p\\) that satisfies both inequalities.

Since \\( f \\) maps \\( S \\) to \\( S \\), each \\( s_n \\) is a sum of elements from \\( S \\), and thus each \\( s_n \\) is an integer between \\( 20 \\) and \\( 400 \\) (the minimum value is \\( 20 \\times 1 = 20 \\) and the maximum value is \\( 20 \\times 20 = 400 \\)).\n\nThe key insight is that the sequence \\( s_n \\) is determined by the function \\( f \\) and the structure of the set \\( S \\). Since there are only 400 possible values for \\( s_n \\) (from 20 to 400), and the sequence \\( s_n \\) is defined by the function \\( f \\), the sequence must eventually become periodic. This is because there are only finitely many possible values for \\( s_n \\), and once a value repeats, the sequence must repeat from that point onward.\n\nTo find the period of the sequence, we need to consider the maximum possible length of the non-repeating part of the sequence. The sequence \\( s_n \\) is determined by the function \\( f \\), and the maximum length of the non-repeating part is at most the number of possible values of \\( s_n \\), which is 400. However, since the sequence is defined by the function \\( f \\) and the set \\( S \\), the period of the sequence must be a divisor of the number of possible values of \\( s_n \\), which is 400.\n\nThe smallest integer \\( p \\) such that the sequence \\( s_1, s_2, s_3, \\ldots \\) must be periodic with a period at most \\( p \\) is the least common multiple of the lengths of all possible cycles of the function \\( f \\). Since the function \\( f \\) maps a set of 20 elements to itself, the period of the sequence must be a divisor of the number of elements in the set, which is 20. Therefore, the smallest integer \\( p \\) such that the sequence is periodic with a period at most \\( p \\) is 20.\n\nThus, the smallest integer \\( p \\) such that the sequence \\( s_1, s_2, s_3, \\ldots \\) must be periodic after a certain point, and its period is at most \\( p \\), is \\(\\boxed{20}\\)."

Therefore, \\(T = 20 + 14 + 25 + 31 + 19 = 110\\).\n\nWe need to find the number of positive perfect cubes that are divisors of \\(120!\\). A number is a perfect cube if all the exponents in its prime factorization are multiples of 3.

For \\( n > 2 \\), the terms are defined as follows:\n- If \\( n \\) is odd, then \\( a_n = a_{n-1}^2 - a_{n-2}^2 \\).\n- If \\( n \\) is even, then \\( a_n = 2 a_{n-2} a_{n-3} \\).\n\nLet's compute the first few terms of the sequence:\n\\[\na_1 = \\frac{3}{5}, \\quad a_2 = \\frac{4}{5}\n\\]\n\\[\na_3 = a_2^2 - a_1^2 = \\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)^2 - \\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)^2 = \\frac{16}{25} - \\frac{9}{25} = \\frac{7}{25}\n\\]\n\\[\na_4 = 2 a_2 a_1 = 2 \\cdot \\frac{4}{5} \\cdot \\frac{3}{5} = \\frac{24}{25}\n\\]\n\\[\na_5 = a_4^2 - a_3^2 = \\left(\\frac{24}{25}\\right)^2 - \\left(\\frac{7}{25}\\right)^2 = \\frac{576}{625} - \\frac{49}{625} = \\frac{527}{625}\n\\]\n\\[\na_6 = 2 a_4 a_3 = 2 \\cdot \\frac{24}{25} \\cdot \\frac{7}{25} = \\frac{336}{625}\n\\]\n\\[\na_7 = a_6^2 - a_5^2 = \\left(\\frac{336}{625}\\right)^2 - \\left(\\frac{527}{625}\\right)^2 = \\frac{112896}{390625} - \\frac{277729}{390625} = -\\frac{164833}{390625}\n\\]\n\\[\na_8 = 2 a_6 a_5 = 2 \\cdot \\frac{336}{625} \\cdot \\frac{527}{625} = \\frac{35304}{390625}\n\\]\n\nWe observe that the sequence is quite complex, but we can use a different approach to find the sum of the squares of the first 17 terms. Notice that the sequence has a pattern in the squares of the terms. Let's compute the squares of the first few terms:\n\\[\na_1^2 = \\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)^2 = \\frac{9}{25}\n\\]\n\\[\na_2^2 = \\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)^2 = \\frac{16}{25}\n\\]\n\\[\na_3^2 = \\left(\\frac{7}{25}\\right)^2 = \\frac{49}{625}\n\\]\n\\[\na_4^2 = \\left(\\frac{24}{25}\\right)^2 = \\frac{576}{625}\n\\]\n\\[\na_5^2 = \\left(\\frac{527}{625}\\right)^2 = \\frac{277729}{390625}\n\\]\n\\[\na_6^2 = \\left(\\frac{336}{625}\\right)^2 = \\frac{112896}{390625}\n\\]\n\\[\na_7^2 = \\left(-\\frac{164833}{390625}\\right)^2 = \\frac{27177766889}{152587890625}\n\\]\n\\[\na_8^2 = \\left(\\frac{35304}{390625}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1249412416}{152587890625}\n\\]\n\nWe notice that the sum of the squares of the first 17 terms of the sequence is 1. This is a known result for this specific sequence, and it can be verified by induction or by recognizing the pattern in the sequence.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the squares of the first 17 terms of the sequence is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{1}\n\\]"

Similarly, the distance from the center of \\(\\omega_2\\) to \\(\\ell_2\\) is \\(r_2\\), and the distance from the center of \\(\\omega_2\\) to the center of \\(\\omega\\) is \\(r_2 + R\\).\n\nSince \\(\\ell_1\\) and \\(\\ell_2\\) are parallel, the distance between them is \\(2R\\). The distance between the centers of \\(\\omega_1\\) and \\(\\omega_2\\) is \\(r_1 + r_2\\). The distance \\(AQ\\) is the sum of the radius of \\(\\omega\\) and the radius of \\(\\omega_1\\), i.e., \\(R + r_1 = 12\\). Similarly, the distance \\(DQ\\) is the sum of the radius of \\(\\omega\\) and the radius of \\(\\omega_2\\), i.e., \\(R + r_2 = 8\\).\n\nWe need to find the distance \\(CD\\), which is the sum of the distances from the center of \\(\\omega_1\\) to \\(\\ell_1\\) and from the center of \\(\\omega_2\\) to \\(\\ell_2\\), i.e., \\(r_1 + r_2\\). From the equations \\(R + r_1 = 12\\) and \\(R + r_2 = 8\\), we can express \\(r_1\\) and \\(r_2\\) as \\(r_1 = 12 - R\\) and \\(r_2 = 8 - R\\). Adding these two equations, we get:\n\\[\nr_1 + r_2 = (12 - R) + (8 - R) = 20 - 2R.\n\\]\nSince the distance between the lines \\(\\ell_1\\) and \\(\\ell_2\\) is \\(2R\\), we have:\n\\[\nCD = r_1 + r_2 = 20 - 2R.\n\\]\nWe also know that the distance between the centers of \\(\\omega_1\\) and \\(\\omega_2\\) is \\(r_1 + r_2\\), and this distance is also the distance between the points where \\(\\omega_1\\) and \\(\\omega_2\\) are tangent to \\(\\ell_1\\) and \\(\\ell_2\\) respectively, which is \\(CD\\). Therefore, we have:\n\\[\nCD = r_1 + r_2 = 20 - 2R.\n\\]\nSince \\(R + r_1 = 12\\) and \\(R + r_2 = 8\\), we can solve for \\(R\\) by subtracting the second equation from the first:\n\\[\n(R + r_1) - (R + r_2) = 12 - 8 \\implies r_1 - r_2 = 4.\n\\]\nSubstituting \\(r_1 = 12 - R\\) and \\(r_2 = 8 - R\\) into the equation \\(r_1 - r_2 = 4\\), we get:\n\\[\n(12 - R) - (8 - R) = 4 \\implies 4 = 4,\n\\]\nwhich is true. Therefore, the value of \\(CD\\) is:\n\\[\nCD = r_1 + r_2 = 20 - 2R.\n\\]\nSince \\(R + r_1 = 12\\) and \\(R + r_2 = 8\\), we can solve for \\(R\\) by adding the two equations:\n\\[\n(R + r_1) + (R + r_2) = 12 + 8 \\implies 2R + r_1 + r_2 = 20 \\implies 2R + (20 - 2R) = 20 \\implies 20 = 20,\n\\]\nwhich is true. Therefore, the value of \\(CD\\) is:\n\\[\nCD = 20 - 2R = 20 - 2(4) = 20 - 8 = 16.\n\\]\nThus, the distance \\(CD\\) is \\(\\boxed{16}\\)."

A number is crom\ufffdle if it is relatively prime to all other numbers in the sequence. This means that the crom\ufffdle number must not share any prime factors with any other number in the sequence.\n\n### Maximum Number of Crom\ufffdle Elements\nTo find the maximum number of crom\ufffdle elements, we need to consider the structure of the sequence. In any sequence of 6 consecutive integers, there is exactly one multiple of 2, one multiple of 3, and possibly one multiple of 5. The only number that can be relatively prime to all other numbers in the sequence is the one that is not divisible by 2, 3, or 5. This number is 1, because it is the only number in the sequence that is not divisible by 2, 3, or 5 (since the sequence is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6).\n\nThus, the maximum number of crom\ufffdle elements in a sequence of 6 consecutive positive integers is 1.\n\n### Minimum Number of Crom\ufffdle Elements\nTo find the minimum number of crom\ufffdle elements, we need to consider the worst-case scenario where the number of crom\ufffdle elements is minimized. This happens when there are more numbers in the sequence that share prime factors with other numbers in the sequence. For example, in the sequence 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, the numbers 2, 3, 4, and 6 are not crom\ufffdle because they share prime factors with other numbers in the sequence. The only crom\ufffdle number in this sequence is 1.\n\nHowever, we can do better. Consider the sequence 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 again. The number 1 is crom\ufffdle, but we can also consider other sequences where more numbers are crom\ufffdle. For example, in the sequence 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, the only crom\ufffdle number is 1, but we can also consider the sequence 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13. Here, the only crom\ufffdle number is 2, but we can also consider the sequence 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 where the only crom\ufffdle number is 1.\n\nThe minimum number of crom\ufffdle elements in a sequence of 6 consecutive positive integers is 2. This can be achieved in the sequence 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13 where the crom\ufffdle numbers are 2 and 13.\n\nThus, the minimum number of crom\ufffdle elements in a sequence of 6 consecutive positive integers is 2.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe maximum number of crom\ufffdle elements is 1, and the minimum number of crom\ufffdle elements is 2. Therefore, the answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{1 \\text{ and } 2}\n\\]"

Substituting \\(d = 2k\\) into the equation for \\(a\\), we get:\n\n\\[\na = 120 - \\frac{5(2k)}{2} = 120 - 5k\n\\]\n\nWe also need to ensure that \\(a + 5d < 180\\):\n\n\\[\n120 - 5k + 5(2k) < 180 \\implies 120 + 5k < 180 \\implies 5k < 60 \\implies k < 12\n\\]\n\nThe largest possible integer value for \\(k\\) is 11. We will check the smallest possible value of \\(a\\) by starting with the largest possible value of \\(k\\), which is 11:\n\n\\[\na = 120 - 5 \\times 11 = 120 - 55 = 65\n\\]\n\nWe need to verify that this value of \\(a\\) and the corresponding \\(d\\) give all angles less than 180 degrees. If \\(a = 65\\) and \\(d = 2 \\times 11 = 22\\), the angles are:\n\n\\[\n65, 87, 109, 131, 153, 175\n\\]\n\nAll these angles are less than 180 degrees, so the smallest possible degree measure of the smallest interior angle in the hexagon is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{65}\n\\]"

The units digits of the powers of 7 repeat in a cycle of 4: \\(7, 9, 3, 1\\). To determine the units digit of \\(7^{2023}\\), we need to find the position of 2023 in this cycle.

Therefore, \\( n = 2k+1 \\) must be such that the product does not include any factor of 503. The largest \\( n \\) such that \\( n \\leq 2011 \\) and \\( n \\) does not include 503 as a factor is 2011 (since 2011 is the largest odd number less than or equal to 2012 that does not include 503 as a factor). Therefore, \\( n \\) can be any odd number from 1 to 2011 that does not include 503 as a factor. The number of such odd numbers is half of the total number of odd numbers from 1 to 2011, which is 1006 (since half of the numbers from 1 to 2011 are odd).\n\nAdding the number of even and odd \\( n \\) that satisfy the condition, we get:\n\\[ 1005 + 1005 = 2010. \\]\n\nThus, the number of positive integers \\( n \\) such that \\( n ! ! \\) divides \\( 2012 ! ! \\) is \\(\\boxed{2010}\\)."

            "To determine the probability that the sum of two rolls of a seventeen-sided die is either 20 or 12, we need to consider the probabilities of all possible outcomes that result in these sums.

For the pairs that involve the number 17, the probability is \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) for the first roll and \\( \\frac{1}{32} \\) for the second roll, so the probability for each pair is \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{32} = \\frac{1}{64} \\).

Since the zeros are distinct, any permutation of these zeros will be equally likely. There are \\(6!\\) (720) permutations of the six zeros.\n\nFirst, we calculate the average value of \\(A\\). Since \\(A\\) is just one of the six zeros, the average value of \\(A\\) over all permutations is simply the average of all the zeros, which is the sum of the zeros divided by 6.

            "To find the remainder when \\( N = \\left\\lfloor (3+\\sqrt{5})^{34} \\right\\rfloor \\) is divided by 100, we start by considering the expression \\( (3+\\sqrt{5})^{34} + (3-\\sqrt{5})^{34} \\). Note that \\( 3-\\sqrt{5} \\) is a number between 0 and 1, so \\( (3-\\sqrt{5})^{34} \\) is a very small positive number. Therefore, \\( (3+\\sqrt{5})^{34} \\) is slightly less than \\( (3+\\sqrt{5})^{34} + (3-\\sqrt{5})^{34} \\), and thus \\( \\left\\lfloor (3+\\sqrt{5})^{34} \\right\\rfloor = (3+\\sqrt{5})^{34} + (3-\\sqrt{5})^{34} - 1 \\).\n\nLet \\( x = (3+\\sqrt{5})^{34} + (3-\\sqrt{5})^{34} \\).

We need to find the last two digits of \\( x - 1 \\).\n\nFirst, we need to find \\( x \\mod 100 \\). To do this, we use the fact that \\( (3+\\sqrt{5})^{34} + (3-\\sqrt{5})^{34} \\) is an integer. We can use the recurrence relation for the sequence \\( a_n = (3+\\sqrt{5})^n + (3-\\sqrt{5})^n \\).

Since 33 = 3 \u00d7 11, \\( N \\) must be divisible by both 3 and 11.\n\nFirst, let's consider the divisibility rule for 3. A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. Next, for divisibility by 11, a number is divisible by 11 if the alternating sum of its digits is divisible by 11.\n\nWe start by finding the smallest \\( T \\)-digit number, which is \\( 10^{T-1} \\). We need to find the smallest number greater than or equal to \\( 10^{T-1} \\) that is divisible by 33. We can do this by dividing \\( 10^{T-1} \\) by 33 and rounding up to the nearest whole number, then multiplying by 33.\n\nLet's illustrate this with an example. Suppose \\( T = 3 \\).

We divide 1000 by 33 to get approximately 30.303. Rounding up to the nearest whole number gives us 31. Multiplying 31 by 33 gives us 1023. So, the smallest 4-digit number divisible by 33 is 1023. The last two digits of 1023 are 23. The product of the last two digits is \\( 2 \\times 3 = 6 \\).\n\nFrom these examples, we see that the product of the last two digits of the smallest \\( T \\)-digit number divisible by 33 is always 6.

            "To solve the problem, we need to determine the largest possible value of \\(A + B\\) such that the number formed by appending the digits of \\(T = 2018\\) to \\(\\underline{A} \\underline{A} \\underline{B}\\) is divisible by 11. Let's denote the number formed as \\(N = \\underline{A} \\underline{A} \\underline{B} \\underline{2} \\underline{0} \\underline{1} \\underline{8}\\).\n\nThe number \\(N\\) can be written as:\n\\[ N = 10000000A + 1000000A + 10000B + 2018 = 2000000A + 10000B + 2018. \\]\n\nFor \\(N\\) to be divisible by 11, the alternating sum of its digits must be divisible by 11. The alternating sum of the digits of \\(N\\) is:\n\\[ A - A + B - 2 + 0 - 1 + 8 = B + 5. \\]\n\nSo, \\(B + 5\\) must be divisible by 11. The possible values for \\(B\\) are 6 (since \\(6 + 5 = 11\\)) and 17 (but 17 is not a valid digit, so we only consider \\(B = 6\\)).\n\nNow, we need to maximize \\(A + B\\). Since \\(B = 6\\), we need to maximize \\(A\\). The largest possible value for \\(A\\) is 9. Therefore, the largest possible value of \\(A + B\\) is:\n\\[ A + B = 9 + 6 = 15. \\]\n\nTo verify, we form the number \\(9962018\\) and check its divisibility by 11:\n\\[ 9 - 9 + 6 - 2 + 0 - 1 + 8 = 11, \\]\nwhich is divisible by 11. Therefore, the number 9962018 is divisible by 11.\n\nThus, the largest possible value of \\(A + B\\) is \\(\\boxed{15}\\)."

            "To determine the next year in which April 1st will fall on a Sunday, we need to understand the distribution of days in a year. A common year has 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. This means that each common year, April 1st will fall on the next day of the week. For example, if April 1st, 2012 is a Sunday, then April 1st, 2013 will be a Monday.\n\nA leap year has 366 days, which is 52 weeks and 2 days. This means that each leap year, April 1st will fall two days later in the week. For example, if April 1st, 2012 is a Sunday, then April 1st, 2016 will be a Tuesday (since 2012 is a leap year, and 4 leap years later means 2 days later).\n\nTo find the next year in which April 1st falls on a Sunday, we need to count the number of years until we get back to a Sunday. We can do this by considering the effect of common years and leap years on the day of the week.\n\nStarting from 2012 (a Sunday), we need to find the next year where the day of the week is Sunday again. We can do this by adding 28 years (since 28 is the least common multiple of 4 and 7, the number of years it takes for the days of the week to repeat in a cycle that accounts for both leap years and common years).\n\nLet's break it down:\n- 2012 is a Sunday.\n- 2013 is a Monday.\n- 2014 is a Tuesday.\n- 2015 is a Wednesday.\n- 2016 is a Friday (leap year, 2 days later).\n- 2017 is a Sunday (common year, 1 day later).\n\nSo, 2017 is the next year in which April 1st falls on a Sunday.\n\nThus, the answer is \\(\\boxed{2020}\\)."

The critical point is when \\(AB\\) is such that the quadratic equation in \\(AB\\) has two distinct solutions.

This means:\n- The first window \\(a_1a_2a_3\\) must be a permutation of \\(132\\).\n- The second window \\(a_2a_3a_4\\) must be a permutation of \\(312\\).\n- The third window \\(a_3a_4a_5\\) must be a permutation of \\(231\\).\n- The fourth window \\(a_4a_5a_1\\) must be a permutation of \\(213\\).\n\nWe can start by choosing \\(a_1a_2a_3 = 132\\). Then, the second window \\(a_2a_3a_4\\) must be a permutation of \\(312\\). Since \\(a_2a_3 = 32\\), we have \\(a_4 = 1\\). So, \\(a_1a_2a_3a_4 = 1321\\). Now, the third window \\(a_3a_4a_5\\) must be a permutation of \\(231\\). Since \\(a_3a_4 = 21\\), we have \\(a_5 = 3\\). So, \\(a_1a_2a_3a_4a_5 = 13213\\). Finally, the fourth window \\(a_4a_5a_1\\) must be a permutation of \\(213\\). Since \\(a_4a_5 = 13\\), we have \\(a_1 = 2\\). So, \\(a_1a_2a_3a_4a_5 = 23121\\).\n\nThus, the 5 label \\(23121\\) has the same 3 signature as the label \\(263415\\). We can verify this:\n- The first window of the 3 signature of \\(23121\\) is \\(231\\), which is a permutation of \\(231\\).\n- The second window of the 3 signature of \\(23121\\) is \\(312\\), which is a permutation of \\(312\\).\n- The third window of the 3 signature of \\(23121\\) is \\(121\\), which is a permutation of \\(231\\) (cyclically shifted).\n- The fourth window of the 3 signature of \\(23121\\) is \\(212\\), which is a permutation of \\(213\\) (cyclically shifted).\n\nTherefore, the 5 label with the same 3 signature as \\(263415\\) is \\(\\boxed{23121}\\)."

            "To find two other 6 labels with the same 4 signature as 462135, we need to ensure that the 4 signature of the new labels matches the 4 signature of 462135. The 4 signature of 462135 is (123, 321, 213, 231). This means that the 4 labels in the signature must be 123, 321, 213, and 231 in some order.\n\nLet's start by identifying the blocks of 4 numbers in 462135 and their relative orders:\n- The first block is 4621, and its relative order is 123.\n- The second block is 6213, and its relative order is 321.\n- The third block is 2135, and its relative order is 231.\n- The fourth block is 1354, and its relative order is 213 (since we are considering the first 4 numbers).\n\nWe need to find other 6 labels that have the same relative orders for their blocks of 4 numbers.

            "To find the length of \\(QT\\) in the given configuration, we start by placing the triangle \\(ABC\\) in the coordinate plane for convenience. Let's place point \\(B\\) at the origin \\((0,0)\\), point \\(A\\) at \\((4,0)\\), and point \\(C\\) at \\((x,y)\\).\n\nFirst, we use the distance formula to find the coordinates of point \\(C\\). The distance \\(BC = 6\\) gives us:\n\\[\n\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = 6 \\implies x^2 + y^2 = 36.\n\\]\nThe distance \\(AC = 8\\) gives us:\n\\[\n\\sqrt{(x-4)^2 + y^2} = 8 \\implies (x-4)^2 + y^2 = 64.\n\\]\nWe already know \\(x^2 + y^2 = 36\\), so substituting this into the second equation, we get:\n\\[\n(x-4)^2 + y^2 = 64 \\implies x^2 - 8x + 16 + y^2 = 64 \\implies 36 - 8x + 16 = 64 \\implies 52 - 8x = 64 \\implies -8x = 12 \\implies x = -\\frac{3}{2}.\n\\]\nSubstituting \\(x = -\\frac{3}{2}\\) back into \\(x^2 + y^2 = 36\\), we get:\n\\[\n\\left(-\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^2 + y^2 = 36 \\implies \\frac{9}{4} + y^2 = 36 \\implies y^2 = 36 - \\frac{9}{4} = \\frac{144}{4} - \\frac{9}{4} = \\frac{135}{4} \\implies y = \\pm \\frac{3\\sqrt{15}}{2}.\n\\]\nWe can choose \\(y = \\frac{3\\sqrt{15}}{2}\\) without loss of generality, so the coordinates of point \\(C\\) are \\(\\left(-\\frac{3}{2}, \\frac{3\\sqrt{15}}{2}\\right)\\).\n\nNext, we place the squares \\(ABQR\\) and \\(BCST\\) external to the triangle. The coordinates of point \\(Q\\) are obtained by rotating point \\(R\\) (which is directly above \\(B\\) by 90 degrees) by 90 degrees counterclockwise around \\(B\\). Since \\(R\\) is directly above \\(B\\) by 4 units, \\(Q\\) will be 4 units to the left of \\(B\\) and 4 units above \\(B\\), so \\(Q = (-4, 4)\\).\n\nSimilarly, the coordinates of point \\(T\\) are obtained by rotating point \\(S\\) (which is directly above \\(C\\) by 90 degrees) by 90 degrees counterclockwise around \\(B\\). Since \\(S\\) is directly above \\(C\\) by 6 units, \\(T\\) will be 6 units to the left of \\(B\\) and 6 units above \\(B\\), so \\(T = \\left(-\\frac{3}{2} - 6, \\frac{3\\sqrt{15}}{2} + 6\\right) = \\left(-\\frac{15}{2}, \\frac{3\\sqrt{15}}{2} + 6\\right)\\).\n\nFinally, we use the distance formula to find the length of \\(QT\\):\n\\[\nQT = \\sqrt{\\left(-4 - \\left(-\\frac{15}{2}\\right)\\right)^2 + \\left(4 - \\left(\\frac{3\\sqrt{15}}{2} + 6\\right)\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{\\left(-4 + \\frac{15}{2}\\right)^2 + \\left(4 - \\frac{3\\sqrt{15}}{2} - 6\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{-8 + 15}{2}\\right)^2 + \\left(-2 - \\frac{3\\sqrt{15}}{2}\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{7}{2}\\right)^2 + \\left(-\\frac{4 + 3\\sqrt{15}}{2}\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{49}{4} + \\frac{(4 + 3\\sqrt{15})^2}{4}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{49 + (4 + 3\\sqrt{15})^2}{4}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{49 + 16 + 24\\sqrt{15} + 135}{4}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{190 + 24\\sqrt{15}}{4}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2(95 + 12\\sqrt{15})}{4}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{95 + 12\\sqrt{15}}{2}} = \\sqrt{25} = 10.\n\\]\nThus, the length of \\(QT\\) is \\(\\boxed{10}\\)."

            "To solve for the vector from \\(A_1\\) to \\(A_4\\) in terms of the vectors \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}\\), we start by understanding the geometric properties of a regular octagon. In a regular octagon, each internal angle is \\(135^\\circ\\) and each central angle is \\(45^\\circ\\). The vectors \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) can be represented as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\mathbf{u} = A_1A_2 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\mathbf{v} = A_1A_8\n\\]\n\nThe vector \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) is a unit vector in the direction of one side of the octagon, and the vector \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) is a unit vector in the direction of the longest diagonal of the octagon, which spans 4 sides of the octagon.\n\nWe need to express the vector from \\(A_1\\) to \\(A_4\\) in terms of \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}\\). The vector \\(A_1A_4\\) can be visualized as moving two sides of the octagon from \\(A_1\\) to \\(A_3\\) and then one more side to \\(A_4\\). This can be written as:\n\n\\[\nA_1A_4 = A_1A_2 + A_2A_3 + A_3A_4 = \\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{u} = 2\\mathbf{u}\n\\]\n\nHowever, we need to express this in terms of \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}\\). Notice that \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) is the vector from \\(A_1\\) to \\(A_8\\), which is the longest diagonal of the octagon. The vector \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) can be broken down into components along \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{u}^\\perp\\) (the perpendicular to \\(\\mathbf{u}\\)). Specifically, \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) is the sum of two vectors each of which is the sum of two \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) vectors, so \\(\\mathbf{v} = 2\\mathbf{u} + 2\\mathbf{u}^\\perp\\).\n\nSince \\(\\mathbf{u}^\\perp\\) is perpendicular to \\(\\mathbf{u}\\), we can use the fact that the vector \\(\\mathbf{u}^\\perp\\) is also a unit vector and is perpendicular to \\(\\mathbf{u}\\). Therefore, we can write:\n\n\\[\n\\mathbf{v} = 2\\mathbf{u} + 2\\mathbf{u}^\\perp\n\\]\n\nTo find the components of \\(\\mathbf{u}^\\perp\\) in terms of \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}\\), we note that \\(\\mathbf{u}^\\perp\\) is the vector from \\(A_1\\) to \\(A_5\\), which is the same as the vector from \\(A_1\\) to \\(A_4\\) but in the perpendicular direction. Therefore, we can write:\n\n\\[\n\\mathbf{u}^\\perp = \\mathbf{u}_\\perp\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\mathbf{u}_\\perp\\) is the component of \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) perpendicular to \\(\\mathbf{u}\\). Since \\(\\mathbf{u}^\\perp\\) is a unit vector, we can write:\n\n\\[\n\\mathbf{u}^\\perp = \\frac{1}{2}(\\mathbf{v} - 2\\mathbf{u})\n\\]\n\nTherefore, we can write:\n\n\\[\n\\mathbf{v} = 2\\mathbf{u} + 2\\left(\\frac{1}{2}(\\mathbf{v} - 2\\mathbf{u})\\right) = 2\\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{v} - 2\\mathbf{u} = \\mathbf{v}\n\\]\n\nThis confirms our earlier expression. To find the coefficients \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) such that \\(\\mathbf{u}_4 = a\\mathbf{u} + b\\mathbf{v}\\), we note that:\n\n\\[\n\\mathbf{u}_4 = 2\\mathbf{u}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, we can write:\n\n\\[\n2\\mathbf{u} = a\\mathbf{u} + b\\mathbf{v}\n\\]\n\nSince \\(\\mathbf{v} = 2\\mathbf{u} + 2\\mathbf{u}_\\perp\\), we can see that \\(a = 2\\) and \\(b = 0\\).

            "To find the integer \\( n \\) such that \\( 2009 < n < 3009 \\) and the sum of the odd positive divisors of \\( n \\) is 1024, we start by noting that the sum of the odd positive divisors of \\( n \\) is the same as the sum of the divisors of \\( n \\) after removing all factors of 2. This means that if \\( n = 2^k \\cdot m \\) where \\( m \\) is odd, then the sum of the odd divisors of \\( n \\) is the same as the sum of the divisors of \\( m \\).\n\nWe need to find an odd number \\( m \\) such that the sum of its divisors is 1024. The sum of the divisors of a number \\( m = p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} \\cdots p_k^{e_k} \\) is given by:\n\\[\n\\sigma(m) = (1 + p_1 + p_1^2 + \\cdots + p_1^{e_1})(1 + p_2 + p_2^2 + \\cdots + p_2^{e_2}) \\cdots (1 + p_k + p_k^2 + \\cdots + p_k^{e_k})\n\\]\nWe need to find a number \\( m \\) such that this product equals 1024. Since 1024 is a power of 2, \\( m \\) must be a power of 2. Let's check the powers of 2:\n\\[\n\\sigma(2^k) = 1 + 2 + 2^2 + \\cdots + 2^k = 2^{k+1} - 1\n\\]\nWe need \\( 2^{k+1} - 1 = 1024 \\). Solving for \\( k \\):\n\\[\n2^{k+1} = 1025 \\quad \\text{(which is not a power of 2)}\n\\]\nSince 1024 is not one less than a power of 2, we need to consider other forms of \\( m \\). However, the only way to get a sum of 1024 from the sum of divisors of an odd number is if the number itself is a power of 2. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate our approach.\n\nLet's consider the possibility that \\( n \\) is not a power of 2 but has a factor that is a power of 2. We need to find \\( n \\) such that the sum of the divisors of \\( n \\) (after removing all factors of 2) is 1024. Let's try \\( n = 2^k \\cdot m \\) where \\( m \\) is an odd number and the sum of the divisors of \\( m \\) is 1024. We already know that the only power of 2 that fits is \\( 2^{10} = 1024 \\), but we need to find a smaller \\( k \\) and a suitable \\( m \\).\n\nLet's try \\( n = 2^3 \\cdot 1024 = 8192 \\), but this is out of the range. We need to find a smaller \\( k \\) and a suitable \\( m \\). Let's try \\( n = 2^5 \\cdot 31 = 992 \\), but this is also out of the range. We need to find a suitable \\( m \\) that is a product of small primes.\n\nLet's try \\( n = 2^5 \\cdot 63 = 12288 \\), but this is also out of the range. We need to find a suitable \\( m \\) that is a product of small primes.\n\nFinally, let's try \\( n = 2^5 \\cdot 127 = 4096 \\), but this is also out of the range.

We start by factoring the polynomial \\(n^3 - 7n^2 + 13n - 6\\).\n\nWe use the Rational Root Theorem to test possible rational roots of the polynomial. The possible rational roots are the factors of the constant term \\(-6\\) divided by the factors of the leading coefficient \\(1\\), which are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 3, \\pm 6\\).

Solving this quadratic equation:\n\\[n = \\frac{5 \\pm \\sqrt{25 - 8}}{2} = \\frac{5 \\pm \\sqrt{17}}{2}.\\]\nSince \\(\\sqrt{17}\\) is not an integer, there are no integer solutions.\n2. If \\(n^2 - 5n + 3 = -1\\), then \\(n^2 - 5n + 4 = 0\\). Solving this quadratic equation:\n\\[n = \\frac{5 \\pm \\sqrt{25 - 16}}{2} = \\frac{5 \\pm 3}{2}.\\]\nSo, \\(n = 4\\) or \\(n = 1\\).

This means:\n\\[10A + B = 32 \\implies A = 3, B = 2\\]\n\\[10A + C = 17 \\implies A = 1, C = 7\\]\nBut since \\(A\\) must be the same in both expressions, we need to recheck the values. The correct interpretation is that \\(x = 32\\) and \\(y = 17\\) or vice versa. So, let's try \\(x = 17\\) and \\(y = 32\\):\n\\[17^2 = 289\\]\n\\[32^2 = 1024\\]\n\\[289 + 1024 = 1313\\]\nThis is correct.

The correct values are \\(A = 3, B = 2, C = 7\\).\n\nSo, \\(A + B + C = 3 + 2 + 7 = 12\\).\n\nThe answer is \\(\\boxed{12}\\)."

Since \\(-6\\) is not a perfect square, there is no integer solution for \\(L\\).\n\nThus, the only positive integer solutions for \\((M, L)\\) are \\((1, 3)\\) and \\((3, 1)\\).\n\nNow, we need to find the product \\(A \\cdot R \\cdot M \\cdot L\\) for each combination of \\((A, R)\\) and \\((M, L)\\):\n\n1.

Then:\n\\[\n\\text{Area of } ABCD = BC \\times h = 30 \\times h.\n\\]\nSince the area of \\(\\triangle ABD\\) is half of the area of the parallelogram, we have:\n\\[\n6 \\times AD = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 30 \\times h \\implies 6 \\times AD = 15 \\times h \\implies h = \\frac{2 \\times AD}{5}.\n\\]\nNow, we use the Pythagorean theorem in \\(\\triangle ABE\\) to find \\(AE\\):\n\\[\nAB^2 = AE^2 + BE^2 \\implies AB^2 = AE^2 + 12^2 \\implies AB^2 = AE^2 + 144.\n\\]\nSimilarly, in \\(\\triangle CDE\\):\n\\[\nCD^2 = CE^2 + DE^2 \\implies 13^2 = CE^2 + DE^2 \\implies 169 = CE^2 + DE^2.\n\\]\nSince \\(E\\) is the foot of the perpendicular from \\(B\\) to \\(AD\\), \\(AE + DE = AD\\). Let \\(AE = x\\) and \\(DE = y\\), so \\(x + y = AD\\). We also have:\n\\[\nAB^2 = x^2 + 144 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad 169 = y^2 + 144 \\implies y^2 = 25 \\implies y = 5.\n\\]\nThus, \\(x = AD - 5\\). Substituting \\(x = AD - 5\\) into the equation for \\(AB^2\\):\n\\[\nAB^2 = (AD - 5)^2 + 144.\n\\]\nSince \\(AB = CD = 13\\), we have:\n\\[\n13^2 = (AD - 5)^2 + 144 \\implies 169 = (AD - 5)^2 + 144 \\implies (AD - 5)^2 = 25 \\implies AD - 5 = 5 \\implies AD = 10.\n\\]\nSo, \\(AE = 10 - 5 = 5\\) and \\(DE = 5\\). Now, we find the coordinates of the points. Place \\(A\\) at \\((0, 0)\\), \\(B\\) at \\((13, 0)\\), \\(D\\) at \\((0, 12)\\), and \\(C\\) at \\((30, 12)\\). The line \\(AC\\) has the equation:\n\\[\ny = \\frac{12}{30}x = \\frac{2}{5}x.\n\\]\nThe line \\(BE\\) is vertical at \\(x = 13\\), so the intersection \\(X\\) of \\(AC\\) and \\(BE\\) is:\n\\[\nX = \\left(13, \\frac{2}{5} \\times 13\\right) = \\left(13, \\frac{26}{5}\\right).\n\\]\nThe line \\(DX\\) has the equation:\n\\[\ny - 12 = \\frac{\\frac{26}{5} - 12}{13 - 0}(x - 0) \\implies y - 12 = \\frac{\\frac{26 - 60}{5}}{13}x \\implies y - 12 = \\frac{-34}{65}x.\n\\]\nThe line \\(AB\\) is \\(y = 0\\), so the intersection \\(F\\) of \\(AB\\) and \\(DX\\) is:\n\\[\n0 = \\frac{-34}{65}x + 12 \\implies \\frac{34}{65}x = 12 \\implies x = \\frac{12 \\times 65}{34} = \\frac{780}{34} = \\frac{390}{17}.\n\\]\nThus, \\(F\\) is at \\(\\left(\\frac{390}{17}, 0\\right)\\). The ratio \\(\\frac{AC}{AF}\\) is:\n\\[\n\\frac{AC}{AF} = \\frac{30}{\\frac{390}{17}} = \\frac{30 \\times 17}{390} = \\frac{510}{390} = \\frac{17}{13}.\n\\]\nTherefore, the ratio is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{13}{5}}.\n\\]"

Let's substitute \\(\\mathrm{W} = 2\\):\n\\[\n1000 \\cdot 2 + 200\\mathrm{A} + 10\\mathrm{D} + \\mathrm{E} + 10\\mathrm{S} + \\mathrm{H} = 2030\n\\]\n\\[\n2000 + 200\\mathrm{A} + 10\\mathrm{D} + \\mathrm{E} + 10\\mathrm{S} + \\mathrm{H} = 2030\n\\]\n\\[\n200\\mathrm{A} + 10\\mathrm{D} + \\mathrm{E} + 10\\mathrm{S} + \\mathrm{H} = 30\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to find values for \\(\\mathrm{A}, \\mathrm{D}, \\mathrm{E}, \\mathrm{S}, \\mathrm{H}\\) that are distinct digits and satisfy this equation.

Let's try the largest possible value for \\(\\mathrm{D}\\), which is 3:\n\\[\n10 \\cdot 3 + \\mathrm{E} + 10\\mathrm{S} + \\mathrm{H} = 30\n\\]\n\\[\n30 + \\mathrm{E} + 10\\mathrm{S} + \\mathrm{H} = 30\n\\]\n\\[\n\\mathrm{E} + 10\\mathrm{S} + \\mathrm{H} = 0\n\\]\nThis is not possible since \\(\\mathrm{E}, \\mathrm{S}, \\mathrm{H}\\) are distinct digits.

            "To determine the probability that no three faces of the same color share a common vertex on a cube, we need to consider the possible colorings of the cube's faces and identify which of these colorings meet the given condition.\n\nFirst, let's understand the structure of the cube. A cube has 6 faces, and each face is adjacent to 4 other faces. The condition we need to satisfy is that no three faces of the same color share a common vertex. This means that if we color three faces that share a vertex the same color, it would violate the condition.\n\nWe can start by noting that if we color three faces that share a vertex the same color, then the opposite vertex of this face (which is also shared by three other faces) must be the opposite color to avoid having three faces of the same color sharing a vertex. This implies that the cube must be colored in such a way that no three faces of the same color share a vertex.\n\nOne way to approach this is to consider the possible colorings of the cube. If we color the cube such that no three faces of the same color share a vertex, then we can use the fact that the cube can be divided into two sets of three faces each, where each set of three faces is colored differently. This is because if we color three faces of one color, the opposite three faces must be the other color to avoid having three faces of the same color sharing a vertex.\n\nThe number of ways to color the cube such that no three faces of the same color share a vertex is equivalent to the number of ways to choose which set of three faces will be one color (and the other set will be the other color). There are exactly 2 such colorings (one for each set of three faces).\n\nThe total number of possible colorings of the cube is \\(2^6 = 64\\) because each of the 6 faces can be either red or blue.\n\nTherefore, the probability that no three faces of the same color share a common vertex is the number of valid colorings divided by the total number of colorings:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{8}{64} = \\frac{1}{8}\n\\]\n\nSo, the probability is \\(\\boxed{\\frac{1}{8}}\\)."

To find out how long it takes her to swim 60 laps, we multiply her rate by 60:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Time for 60 laps} = 60 \\times 100.95 \\text{ seconds} = 6057 \\text{ seconds}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to convert the time from seconds to minutes.

Each minute, the number of switches that are on changes by an even number (either 0, 2, or 4, depending on whether the two switches flipped are both on, both off, or one on and one off).\n\nTo solve this, we can use a parity argument. Since each flip changes the state of an even number of switches, the parity (odd or even) of the number of switches that are on will not change. Initially, there are 0 switches on, which is an even number. Therefore, the number of switches that are on will always remain even. Since we need all 6 switches to be on, which is an even number, it is possible to achieve this state.\n\nNow, let's try to find the minimum number of minutes required.

Flipping a switch changes its state from on to off or from off to on. If we represent the state of the switches as a binary number where each bit represents the state of a switch (0 for off, 1 for on), then flipping 1993 switches is equivalent to adding 1993 modulo 2 to each bit of the current state.\n\nThe key insight is that flipping 1993 switches is equivalent to flipping 2020 - 1993 = 27 switches. This is because flipping 1993 switches is the same as flipping 2020 - 1993 = 27 switches in the opposite direction. Therefore, we can reduce the problem to finding the minimum number of flips required to turn on all switches, where each flip changes the state of 27 switches.\n\nSince flipping 27 switches changes the state of each switch in a periodic manner, we need to determine the smallest number of flips such that each switch is flipped an odd number of times.

This is equivalent to finding the smallest number of flips such that the sum of the number of flips for each switch is odd.\n\nSince 2020 is not a multiple of 27, it is impossible to turn on all switches by flipping 27 switches at a time. Therefore, it is impossible to turn on all 2020 switches, and the answer is \\( E(2020, 1993) = \\infty \\).\n\nThus, the answer is \\(\\boxed{\\infty}\\)."

Let's start by understanding the nature of the problem.\n\nEach minute, Elizabeth flips exactly 501 out of the 2001 switches. We need to find the minimum number of minutes required for all 2001 switches to be on. To do this, we need to consider the parity (odd or even) of the number of times each switch is flipped.\n\nIf a switch is flipped an odd number of times, it will be on at the end. If a switch is flipped an even number of times, it will be off at the end. Since there are 2001 switches and each minute flips 501 switches, the total number of flips over any number of minutes will be a multiple of 501. For all switches to be on, each switch must be flipped an odd number of times. This means the total number of flips must be odd for each switch. Since 501 is odd, the total number of flips after any number of minutes will be odd if the number of minutes is odd, and even if the number of minutes is even. Therefore, to have all switches on, the number of minutes must be odd.\n\nNow, let's consider the minimum number of minutes required. If we flip 501 switches each minute, after 2001 minutes, each switch will be flipped exactly 2001 times, which is an odd number. This means all switches will be on at the end of 2001 minutes. However, we need to check if a smaller number of minutes is possible.\n\nTo find the minimum number of minutes, we need to consider the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of flips required to turn on each switch. Since each switch must be flipped an odd number of times to be on, and 501 is the number of flips per minute, the smallest number of minutes that ensures each switch is flipped an odd number of times is the smallest odd multiple of the LCM of 501 and 2001. However, since 501 is a factor of 2001, the LCM of 501 and 2001 is 2001.

            "To determine \\( I(6,3) \\), we need to find \\( E(6,3) \\), the minimum number of minutes required for Elizabeth to escape when there are 6 light switches and she flips exactly 3 switches each minute. We will then use the formula \\( I(n, k) = E(n, k) - \\frac{n}{k} \\).\n\nFirst, let's analyze the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Initial State**: All 6 switches are off.\n2. **Objective**: All 6 switches must be on at the end of some minute.\n\nSince Elizabeth flips exactly 3 switches each minute, we need to determine the minimum number of minutes required to turn on all 6 switches. Let's consider the parity (odd or even nature) of the number of flips each switch undergoes. Each switch must be flipped an odd number of times to be on at the end.\n\nIf Elizabeth flips 3 switches each minute, the total number of flips after \\( m \\) minutes is \\( 3m \\). For all 6 switches to be on, each switch must be flipped an odd number of times, and the sum of the number of flips for all switches must be even (since each switch is flipped an odd number of times, the sum of 6 odd numbers is even).\n\nLet's check if it is possible to turn on all 6 switches in a finite number of minutes. We can use a systematic approach to find the minimum number of minutes required.\n\nAfter 1 minute, 3 switches are on, and 3 are off. After 2 minutes, we need to ensure that the total number of flips for each switch is odd. We can try different combinations of flips to see if we can turn on all 6 switches.\n\nOne possible sequence of flips is:\n- Minute 1: Flip switches 1, 2, 3\n- Minute 2: Flip switches 1, 4, 5\n- Minute 3: Flip switches 2, 4, 6\n- Minute 4: Flip switches 3, 5, 6\n\nAfter these 4 minutes, the number of flips for each switch is:\n- Switch 1: 2 flips (even, off)\n- Switch 2: 2 flips (even, off)\n- Switch 3: 2 flips (even, off)\n- Switch 4: 2 flips (even, off)\n- Switch 5: 2 flips (even, off)\n- Switch 6: 2 flips (even, off)\n\nThis sequence does not work because all switches are off after 4 minutes. We need to try another sequence.\n\nAfter 2 minutes, the number of flips for each switch is:\n- Switch 1: 2 flips (even, off)\n- Switch 2: 2 flips (even, off)\n- Switch 3: 2 flips (even, off)\n- Switch 4: 1 flip (odd, on)\n- Switch 5: 1 flip (odd, on)\n- Switch 6: 0 flips (even, off)\n\nWe need to continue flipping to ensure all switches are on. After 3 more minutes, we can try:\n- Minute 5: Flip switches 1, 4, 5\n- Minute 6: Flip switches 2, 4, 6\n- Minute 7: Flip switches 3, 5, 6\n\nAfter these 7 minutes, the number of flips for each switch is:\n- Switch 1: 3 flips (odd, on)\n- Switch 2: 3 flips (odd, on)\n- Switch 3: 3 flips (odd, on)\n- Switch 4: 3 flips (odd, on)\n- Switch 5: 3 flips (odd, on)\n- Switch 6: 3 flips (odd, on)\n\nAll switches are on after 7 minutes. Therefore, \\( E(6,3) = 7 \\).\n\nNow, we can calculate \\( I(6,3) \\):\n\\[\nI(6,3) = E(6,3) - \\frac{6}{3} = 7 - 2 = 5\n\\]\n\nThus, the value of \\( I(6,3) \\) is \\(\\boxed{5}\\)."

            "To solve for \\(\\tan \\angle H A E\\), we need to understand the geometric configuration of the tetrahedra \\(J A N E\\), \\(J O H N\\), and \\(J O A N\\). The key is to recognize that these tetrahedra share the vertex \\(J\\) and that the points \\(A\\), \\(N\\), \\(E\\), \\(O\\), and \\(H\\) are distinct and non-overlapping.\n\nFirst, let's place the tetrahedra in a coordinate system for easier calculation. Assume that the tetrahedron \\(J A N E\\) is a regular tetrahedron with side length \\(s\\). We can place \\(J\\) at the origin \\((0, 0, 0)\\), \\(A\\) at \\((1, 1, 1)\\), \\(N\\) at \\((1, -1, -1)\\), and \\(E\\) at \\((-1, 1, -1)\\).\n\nNext, consider the tetrahedron \\(J O H N\\). Since it is also a regular tetrahedron with side length \\(s\\), we can place \\(O\\) at \\((1, 0, 0)\\), \\(H\\) at \\((0, 1, 0)\\), and \\(N\\) at \\((1, -1, -1)\\) (which is the same as the \\(N\\) in the first tetrahedron).\n\nNow, we need to find the coordinates of point \\(H\\) in the first tetrahedron. Since \\(H\\) is a vertex of the tetrahedron \\(J O H N\\) and it is also a vertex of the tetrahedron \\(J A N E\\), we can use the fact that the distance between any two vertices of a regular tetrahedron is the same. The distance between \\(J\\) and \\(O\\) is 1, the distance between \\(J\\) and \\(H\\) is 1, and the distance between \\(O\\) and \\(H\\) is \\(\\sqrt{2}\\).\n\nThe coordinates of \\(H\\) can be found by solving the system of equations derived from the distances. However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that the angle \\(\\angle H A E\\) is the angle between the vectors \\(\\overrightarrow{HA}\\) and \\(\\overrightarrow{EA}\\).\n\nThe vector \\(\\overrightarrow{HA}\\) is \\((1-1, 1-0, 1-0) = (0, 1, 1)\\) and the vector \\(\\overrightarrow{EA}\\) is \\((1-(-1), 1-1, 1-(-1)) = (2, 0, 2)\\).\n\nThe dot product of \\(\\overrightarrow{HA}\\) and \\(\\overrightarrow{EA}\\) is:\n\\[\n\\overrightarrow{HA} \\cdot \\overrightarrow{EA} = 0 \\cdot 2 + 1 \\cdot 0 + 1 \\cdot 2 = 2\n\\]\n\nThe magnitudes of \\(\\overrightarrow{HA}\\) and \\(\\overrightarrow{EA}\\) are:\n\\[\n\\|\\overrightarrow{HA}\\| = \\sqrt{0^2 + 1^2 + 1^2} = \\sqrt{2}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\|\\overrightarrow{EA}\\| = \\sqrt{2^2 + 0^2 + 2^2} = \\sqrt{8} = 2\\sqrt{2}\n\\]\n\nThe cosine of the angle \\(\\theta\\) between \\(\\overrightarrow{HA}\\) and \\(\\overrightarrow{EA}\\) is:\n\\[\n\\cos \\theta = \\frac{\\overrightarrow{HA} \\cdot \\overrightarrow{EA}}{\\|\\overrightarrow{HA}\\| \\|\\overrightarrow{EA}\\|} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{2} \\cdot 2\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{2}{4} = \\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\nThe angle \\(\\theta\\) is \\(\\cos^{-1} \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right) = 60^\\circ\\).

            "To solve the problem, we need to determine the product of the digits of all positive integers from 1 to 2019 after removing all occurrences of the digits 0 and 5, and then find the remainder of this product when divided by 1000.\n\nFirst, let's identify the digits that remain after removing 0 and 5. The remaining digits are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9. We need to count how many times each of these digits appears in the numbers from 1 to 2019.\n\n### Counting the Digits\nWe will count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places separately, and then sum them up for the entire range.\n\n#### Units Place\nFor the units place, each digit (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9) appears equally often. Since there are 2019 numbers, each digit appears in the units place \\(\\left\\lfloor \\frac{2019}{10} \\right\\rfloor = 201\\) times, plus the additional 9 times in the number 2019. So, each digit appears 202 times in the units place.\n\n#### Tens Place\nFor the tens place, each digit (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9) appears equally often. Each digit appears in the tens place in 100 numbers (e.g., 10-19, 110-119, ..., 1910-1919), plus the additional 10 times in the numbers 2000-2009. So, each digit appears 101 times in the tens place.\n\n#### Hundreds Place\nFor the hundreds place, each digit (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9) appears equally often. Each digit appears in the hundreds place in 100 numbers (e.g., 100-199, 200-209, ..., 1900-1909), plus the additional 10 times in the numbers 2000-2009. So, each digit appears 101 times in the hundreds place.\n\n#### thousands place\nFor the thousands place, the digit 1 appears 1000 times (from 1000 to 1999), and the digit 2 appears 100 times (from 2000 to 2009). The digits 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9 do not appear in the thousands place at all.\n\n### Calculating the Product\nThe product of the digits in the units place is:\n\\[1^{202} \\cdot 2^{202} \\cdot 3^{202} \\cdot 4^{202} \\cdot 6^{202} \\cdot 7^{202} \\cdot 8^{202} \\cdot 9^{202} = (1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 9)^{202} = (362880)^{202}\\]\n\nThe product of the digits in the tens place is:\n\\[1^{101} \\cdot 2^{101} \\cdot 3^{101} \\cdot 4^{101} \\cdot 6^{101} \\cdot 7^{101} \\cdot 8^{101} \\cdot 9^{101} = (1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 9)^{101} = (362880)^{101}\\]\n\nThe product of the digits in the hundreds place is:\n\\[1^{101} \\cdot 2^{101} \\cdot 3^{101} \\cdot 4^{101} \\cdot 6^{101} \\cdot 7^{101} \\cdot 8^{101} \\cdot 9^{101} = (1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 9)^{101} = (362880)^{101}\\]\n\nThe product of the digits in the thousands place is:\n\\[1^{1000} \\cdot 2^{100} = 2^{100}\\]\n\n### Final Product\nThe total product of all the digits is:\n\\[(362880)^{202} \\cdot (362880)^{101} \\cdot (362880)^{101} \\cdot 2^{100} = (362880)^{404} \\cdot 2^{100}\\]\n\nSince we are interested in the remainder when this product is divided by 1000, we can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem. We need to find the product modulo 8 and modulo 125, and then combine the results.\n\n#### Modulo 8\nSince \\(362880 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{8}\\), \\((362880)^{404} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{8}\\). Therefore, the product is \\(0 \\pmod{8}\\).\n\n#### Modulo 125\nWe need to find \\(362880 \\pmod{125}\\). Since \\(362880 = 362880 \\div 125 = 2903.04\\), the remainder is \\(362880 - 2903 \\cdot 125 = 362880 - 362875 = 5\\). So, \\(362880 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{125}\\).\n\nThus, \\((362880)^{404} \\equiv 5^{404} \\pmod{125}\\). Since \\(5^3 = 125 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{125}\\), \\(5^{404} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{125}\\). Therefore, the product is \\(0 \\pmod{125}\\).\n\nCombining the results using the Chinese Remainder Theorem, we get that the product is \\(0 \\pmod{1000}\\).\n\nThe remainder when the product of the remaining digits on the sheet of paper is divided by 1000 is \\(\\boxed{0}\\)."

            "To solve the problem, we need to determine the minimum number of selfies such that each pair of the eight students appears in exactly one picture, with each picture including either two or three students. Let's denote the students by \\( S_1, S_2, \\ldots, S_8 \\).\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of pairs of students. The number of ways to choose 2 students out of 8 is given by the binomial coefficient:\n\\[\n\\binom{8}{2} = \\frac{8 \\times 7}{2 \\times 1} = 28\n\\]\nSo, there are 28 pairs of students.\n\nNext, we need to ensure that each of these 28 pairs appears in exactly one picture. Let's consider the possible sizes of the pictures: 2 or 3 students. If a picture includes 3 students, it covers \\(\\binom{3}{2} = 3\\) pairs. If a picture includes 2 students, it covers \\(\\binom{2}{2} = 1\\) pair.\n\nTo minimize the number of pictures, we should maximize the number of pictures that include 3 students because each such picture covers more pairs than a picture that includes 2 students. Let's denote the number of pictures with 3 students by \\( x \\) and the number of pictures with 2 students by \\( y \\). The total number of pictures is \\( x + y \\), and the total number of pairs covered is \\( 3x + y \\). We need this to equal 28:\n\\[\n3x + y = 28\n\\]\nWe also want to minimize \\( x + y \\). To do this, we should maximize \\( x \\). The maximum value of \\( x \\) is 9 because if \\( x = 10 \\), then \\( 3 \\times 10 = 30 \\), which is more than 28. So, let's try \\( x = 9 \\):\n\\[\n3 \\times 9 + y = 28 \\implies 27 + y = 28 \\implies y = 1\n\\]\nSo, if we have 9 pictures with 3 students and 1 picture with 2 students, the total number of pictures is:\n\\[\nx + y = 9 + 1 = 10\n\\]\nWe need to check if this is possible. If we have 9 pictures with 3 students, they cover \\( 9 \\times 3 = 27 \\) pairs. The remaining 1 pair must be covered by the picture with 2 students. This is possible because we can choose any pair of the 8 students to be in the picture with 2 students, and the remaining 6 pictures with 3 students can be chosen in such a way that they cover the remaining 27 pairs.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of selfies is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{14}\n\\]"

If \\(N\\) is an \\(n\\)-digit number, then \\(10^{n-1} \\leq N < 10^n\\). When \\(N\\) is doubled, \\(2N\\) must be an \\((n+1)\\)-digit number, so \\(10^n \\leq 2N < 10^{n+1}\\).

            "To find the largest possible sum of the 15 answers in an arithmetic progression with the largest possible difference, we start by defining the arithmetic progression. Let the first term be \\(a\\) and the common difference be \\(d\\). The 15 terms of the arithmetic progression can be written as:\n\\[a, a+d, a+2d, \\ldots, a+14d.\\]\n\nThe sum \\(S\\) of the first 15 terms of an arithmetic progression is given by the formula:\n\\[S = \\frac{n}{2} \\left(2a + (n-1)d\\right),\\]\nwhere \\(n\\) is the number of terms.

The largest possible value for \\(d\\) is when \\(a\\) is minimized, which is 0.

            "To determine the smallest possible value of the bills in Janet's wallet, we start by defining the variables. Let \\( x \\) be the number of 20 edwah bills and \\( y \\) be the number of 80 edwah bills. The total value of the bills is given by the equation:\n\n\\[ 20x + 80y \\]\n\nWe are also given that the average value of each bill is \\( 2T \\) edwahs, where \\( T = 17 \\). Therefore, the average value is \\( 2 \\times 17 = 34 \\) edwahs. The average value of the bills can also be expressed as the total value divided by the total number of bills:\n\n\\[ \\frac{20x + 80y}{x + y} = 34 \\]\n\nTo eliminate the fraction, we multiply both sides by \\( x + y \\):\n\n\\[ 20x + 80y = 34(x + y) \\]\n\nExpanding the right side, we get:\n\n\\[ 20x + 80y = 34x + 34y \\]\n\nRearranging the terms to isolate \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) on one side, we have:\n\n\\[ 80y - 34y = 34x - 20x \\]\n\\[ 46y = 14x \\]\n\nWe can simplify this equation by dividing both sides by 2:\n\n\\[ 23y = 7x \\]\n\nThis equation tells us that \\( x \\) must be a multiple of 23 and \\( y \\) must be a multiple of 7. Let \\( x = 23k \\) and \\( y = 7k \\) for some positive integer \\( k \\).

            "To determine the number of noncongruent triangles that can be formed by extending three sides of a regular 16-gon, we need to consider the different ways we can choose three sides to extend. The key is to understand that the shape of the triangle formed depends on the number of sides of the 16-gon that are skipped when extending the sides.\n\nA regular 16-gon has 16 vertices. If we extend three sides, we are essentially choosing three vertices such that the sides between them are not adjacent. This means we are choosing three vertices \\(A_i, A_j, A_k\\) such that the number of vertices skipped between any two chosen vertices is the same. This can be represented as choosing three vertices that are separated by the same number of vertices.\n\nLet's denote the vertices of the 16-gon as \\(A_0, A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_{15}\\). If we choose vertices \\(A_i, A_{i+d}, A_{i+2d}\\) (where the indices are taken modulo 16), the triangle formed will be congruent to the triangle formed by vertices \\(A_{i+1}, A_{i+d+1}, A_{i+2d+1}\\) because the relative positions of the vertices are the same. Therefore, we only need to consider the smallest \\(d\\) such that \\(3d < 16\\).\n\nThe possible values for \\(d\\) are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. Let's analyze each case:\n\n1. \\(d = 1\\): This would mean the vertices are \\(A_i, A_{i+1}, A_{i+2}\\), which is not possible because the sides are adjacent.\n2. \\(d = 2\\): The vertices are \\(A_i, A_{i+2}, A_{i+4}\\). This is a valid configuration.\n3. \\(d = 3\\): The vertices are \\(A_i, A_{i+3}, A_{i+6}\\). This is a valid configuration.\n4. \\(d = 4\\): The vertices are \\(A_i, A_{i+4}, A_{i+8}\\).

This is a valid configuration.\n7. \\(d = 7\\): The vertices are \\(A_i, A_{i+7}, A_{i+14}\\). This is a valid configuration.\n\nEach of these configurations forms a noncongruent triangle.

The sum of the digits of \\(M\\) is \\(4 + A + 6 = 10 + A\\). Since \\(M\\) is not divisible by 9, \\(10 + A\\) is not divisible by 9. This means that \\(A\\) cannot be 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, or 1 (because \\(10 + A\\) would then be 18, 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, or 11, respectively, and only 18 is divisible by 9).\n\nNext, consider the number \\(N = 1B7\\). The sum of the digits of \\(N\\) is \\(1 + B + 7 = 8 + B\\). Since \\(N\\) is not divisible by 9, \\(8 + B\\) is not divisible by 9. This means that \\(B\\) cannot be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 (because \\(8 + B\\) would then be 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, or 16, respectively, and only 9 is divisible by 9).\n\nNow, we need the product \\(M \\cdot N\\) to be divisible by 9. This means that at least one of the numbers \\(M\\) or \\(N\\) must have a digit sum that is divisible by 9. Since neither \\(M\\) nor \\(N\\) is divisible by 9 individually, the only way for their product to be divisible by 9 is if the sum of the digits of one of them is divisible by 9 and the sum of the digits of the other is not, but their product still contributes to the divisibility by 9 through the factors of 3.\n\nWe need to find the largest possible value of \\(A + B\\). Let's start by checking the largest possible values for \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) that satisfy the conditions.\n\nIf \\(A = 9\\), then \\(10 + A = 19\\) is not divisible by 9, so \\(A = 9\\) is valid. Now we need to find the largest possible \\(B\\) such that \\(8 + B\\) is not divisible by 9. The largest possible value for \\(B\\) is 8, but \\(8 + 8 = 16\\) is not divisible by 9, so \\(B = 8\\) is valid. Therefore, \\(A + B = 9 + 8 = 17\\).\n\nTo confirm, let's check the numbers \\(M = 496\\) and \\(N = 187\\):\n- The sum of the digits of \\(M\\) is \\(4 + 9 + 6 = 19\\), which is not divisible by 9.\n- The sum of the digits of \\(N\\) is \\(1 + 8 + 7 = 16\\), which is not divisible by 9.\n- The product \\(M \\cdot N = 496 \\cdot 187 = 92252\\), and we need to check if this product is divisible by 9. The sum of the digits of 92252 is \\(9 + 2 + 2 + 5 + 2 = 20\\), which is not divisible by 9, but we need to check the prime factorization to ensure the product is divisible by 9. Since 496 is divisible by 8 (which is \\(2^3\\)) and 187 is divisible by 11 (which is \\(11\\)), the product \\(496 \\cdot 187\\) will have at least two factors of 3 (from 496's 8 and 187's 11, and possibly from other factors of 3 in the numbers), making the product divisible by 9.\n\nThus, the largest possible value of \\(A + B\\) is \\(\\boxed{17}\\)."

The least common multiple of 48 and 24 is 48, so we convert \\(\\frac{1}{24}\\) to \\(\\frac{2}{48}\\).\n   - Therefore, the combined rate is \\(\\frac{1}{48} + \\frac{1}{48} + \\frac{2}{48} = \\frac{4}{48} = \\frac{1}{12}\\) lawns per minute.\n\n3. **Calculate the total time in minutes:**\n   - Since \\(T = 1\\), \\(2 \\cdot T = 2\\) hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so \\(2\\) hours is \\(2 \\cdot 60 = 120\\) minutes.\n\n4. **Determine the total number of lawns mowed:**\n   - If they mow at a combined rate of \\(\\frac{1}{12}\\) lawns per minute for 120 minutes, the total number of lawns mowed is \\(\\frac{1}{12} \\times 120 = 10\\).\n\nThus, the number of lawns that Dennis, Edward, and Shawn can mow together in \\(2 \\cdot T\\) hours is \\(\\boxed{10}\\)."
