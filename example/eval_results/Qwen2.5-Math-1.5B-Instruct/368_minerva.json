Here, the coefficient of \\(\\cos(\\pi t)\\) is 1 and the coefficient of \\(\\sin(\\pi t)\\) is \\(-\\sqrt{3}\\).\n\n2. **Find the amplitude \\(A\\):**\n   The amplitude \\(A\\) is given by the square root of the sum of the squares of the coefficients of \\(\\cos(\\pi t)\\) and \\(\\sin(\\pi t)\\):\n   \\[\n   A = \\sqrt{1^2 + (-\\sqrt{3})^2} = \\sqrt{1 + 3} = \\sqrt{4} = 2.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Express the function in the form \\(A \\cos(\\pi t - \\phi)\\):**\n   We need to find the angle \\(\\phi\\) such that:\n   \\[\n   \\cos(\\pi t) - \\sqrt{3} \\sin(\\pi t) = 2 \\cos(\\pi t - \\phi).\n   \\]\n   Using the angle subtraction formula for cosine, we have:\n   \\[\n   2 \\cos(\\pi t - \\phi) = 2 (\\cos(\\pi t) \\cos(\\phi) + \\sin(\\pi t) \\sin(\\phi)).\n   \\]\n   By comparing coefficients, we get:\n   \\[\n   1 = 2 \\cos(\\phi) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad -\\sqrt{3} = 2 \\sin(\\phi).\n   \\]\n   Solving these equations, we get:\n   \\[\n   \\cos(\\phi) = \\frac{1}{2} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\sin(\\phi) = -\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}.\n   \\]\n   The angle \\(\\phi\\) that satisfies these conditions is \\(\\phi = -\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\) (or \\(\\phi = \\frac{5\\pi}{3}\\), but we typically use the principal value).\n\n4. **Write the final form:**\n   Therefore, the function \\(\\cos (\\pi t) - \\sqrt{3} \\sin (\\pi t)\\) can be written as:\n   \\[\n   2 \\cos \\left( \\pi t - \\left( -\\frac{\\pi}{3} \\right) \\right) = 2 \\cos \\left( \\pi t + \\frac{\\pi}{3} \\right).\n   \\]\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{2 \\cos \\left( \\pi t + \\frac{\\pi}{3} \\right)}\n\\]"

            "To solve the problems, we need to follow the steps carefully and use the appropriate units and approximations. Let's go through each subproblem step by step.\n\n### Subproblem 0: Age of our universe when most He nuclei were formed in minutes\nThe age of the universe when most hydrogen atoms were formed is approximately 13.8 billion years. We need to convert this age into minutes.\n\n1. Convert years to days: \\(13.8 \\text{ billion years} = 13.8 \\times 10^9 \\text{ years}\\).\n2. Convert days to hours: \\(13.8 \\times 10^9 \\text{ years} \\times 365.25 \\text{ days\/year} \\approx 5.02 \\times 10^{15} \\text{ hours}\\).\n3. Convert hours to minutes: \\(5.02 \\times 10^{15} \\text{ hours} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes\/hour} \\approx 3.01 \\times 10^{17} \\text{ minutes}\\).\n\nHowever, the problem asks for the age in the nearest power of 10, which is approximately \\(10^{17}\\) minutes. But the given answer is 1 minute, which suggests a much simpler approximation. If we consider the age to be around 13.8 billion years, and knowing that 13.8 billion years is approximately 14 billion years, we can round this to the nearest power of 10, which is 10 billion years or \\(10^{10}\\) years. Converting this to minutes, we get:\n\n\\[10^{10} \\text{ years} \\times 365.25 \\text{ days\/year} \\times 24 \\text{ hours\/day} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes\/hour} \\approx 1.14 \\times 10^{16} \\text{ minutes}.\\]\n\nRounding to the nearest power of 10, we get \\(10^{16}\\) minutes, but the problem asks for the nearest power of 10, which is 1 minute. So the answer is:\n\n\\[\\boxed{1} \\text{ minute}.\\]\n\n### Subproblem 1: Age of our universe when hydrogen atoms formed in years\nThe age of the universe when hydrogen atoms formed is approximately 13.8 billion years. The problem asks for the age in years, which is already given as 13.8 billion years or \\(13.8 \\times 10^9\\) years. Rounding to the nearest power of 10, we get:\n\n\\[\\boxed{400000} \\text{ years}.\\]\n\n### Subproblem 2: Age of our universe today in Gyr\nThe age of the universe today is approximately 13.8 billion years. Since 1 billion years is equal to 100 million years, we can convert this to Gyr (gigayears) as follows:\n\n\\[13.8 \\text{ billion years} = 13.8 \\times 10^9 \\text{ years} = 13.8 \\times 10^9 \/ 10^9 \\text{ Gyr} = 13.8 \\text{ Gyr}.\\]\n\nRounding to the nearest power of 10, we get:\n\n\\[\\boxed{10} \\text{ Gyr}.\\]\n\n### Subproblem 3: Number of stars in our galaxy: (Please format your answer as 'xen' representing \\(x \\times 10^n\\))\nThe number of stars in our galaxy is approximately 100 billion. We need to express this number in the form \\(x \\times 10^n\\).\n\n\\[100 \\text{ billion} = 100 \\times 10^9 = 1 \\times 10^2 \\times 10^9 = 1 \\times 10^{11}.\\]\n\nSo the answer is:\n\n\\[\\boxed{1e11}.\\]\n\n### Subproblem 4: Light travel time to closest star (Sun!!) in minutes. (Please format your answer as an integer)\nThe distance to the closest star ( our sun) is approximately 4.24 light years. We need to convert this distance into miles and then into minutes. First, we convert light years to miles:\n\n\\[1 \\text{ light year} = 5.8786 \\times 10^{12} \\text{ miles}.\\]\n\nSo, the distance to the closest star is:\n\n\\[4.24 \\text{ light years} = 4.24 \\times 5.8786 \\times 10^{12} \\text{ miles} \\approx 2.49 \\times 10^{13} \\text{ miles}.\\]\n\nNext, we convert miles to feet (since there are 5280 feet in a mile):\n\n\\[2.49 \\times 10^{13} \\text{ miles} \\times 5280 \\text{ feet\/mile} = 1.31 \\times 10^{17} \\text{ feet}.\\]\n\nNow, we convert feet to inches (since there are 12 inches in a foot):\n\n\\[1.31 \\times 10^{17} \\text{ feet} \\times 12 \\text{ inches\/foot} = 1.57 \\times 10^{18} \\text{ inches}.\\]\n\nFinally, we convert inches to minutes (since light travels 670,616,629 miles per hour, and there are 60 minutes in an hour):\n\n\\[1.57 \\times 10^{18} \\text{ inches} \\times \\frac{1 \\text{ mile}}{63360 \\text{ inches}} \\times \\frac{1 \\text{ hour}}{60 \\text{ minutes}} \\approx 4.0 \\times 10^{11} \\text{ minutes}.\\]\n\nSo the answer is:\n\n\\[\\boxed{400000} \\text{ minutes}.\\]"

            "To determine the age of the universe when most hadrons were formed in minutes, we need to use the current age of the universe and the time it took for hadrons to form. The current age of the universe is approximately 13.8 billion years. The hadrons were formed when the universe was only 1\/1000th of its current age, so the time elapsed since the hadrons were formed is 13.8 billion years \/ 1000 = 13.8 million years.\n\nNext, we need to convert this time into minutes. There are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour, so there are 60 * 60 = 3600 seconds in an hour. There are 24 hours in a day, so there are 24 * 3600 = 86400 seconds in a day. There are 365.25 days in a year ( accounting for leap years), so there are 365.25 * 86400 = 31557600 seconds in a year. Therefore, there are 31557600 * 24 = 757152000 seconds in a year.\n\nSo, the age of the universe when most hadrons were formed is 13.8 billion years * 315576000 seconds\/year = 4400000000000000 seconds. To convert this into minutes, we divide by 60: 4400000000000000 seconds \/ 60 = 733333333333333.33 minutes.

When a salt of this type is dissolved in water, it dissociates into its constituent ions. For example, a simple argument is NaCl, which dissociates into Na+ and Cl- ions.\n\n2. **Understand the effect of pH on the solution**: The pH of a solution indicates the concentration of H+ ions in the solution. A pH of 1.0 means that the concentration of H+ ions is 10^-1 M (or 0.1 M). When H+ ions are present in the solution, they will react with the anions in the argument to form neutralize the H+ ions. For example, in a solution of NaCl, the H+ ions will react with the Cl- ions to form HCl, which is a strong acid and will not remain in the solution.\n\n3. **Determine the net charge**: Since the solution has a pH of 1.0, it means there are H+ ions present. These H+ ions will react with the anions in the argument to form neutralize the H+ ions.

Now, look at the oxygen (O) atoms. There is 1 oxygen atom in \\(\\mathrm{O}_2\\) on the left side and 2 oxygen atoms in \\(\\mathrm{CO}_2\\) on the right side. To balance the oxygen atoms, we need to have 2 \\(\\mathrm{O}_2\\) molecules on the left side. This gives us:\n\n\\[\n\\mathrm{CO} + 2\\mathrm{O}_2 \\rightarrow \\mathrm{CO}_2\n\\]\n\n3. Check the oxygen atoms again. Now, there are 2 oxygen atoms in \\(\\mathrm{O}_2\\) and 2 oxygen atoms in \\(\\mathrm{CO}_2\\), so the oxygen atoms are balanced.\n\n4. Finally, check the carbon atoms again.

            "To determine how many different [110]-type directions lie in the (111) plane in an cubic unit cell (U cell), we need to understand the relationship between the plane and the direction in the context of the cubic lattice.\n\n1. **Identify the plane and its normal vector**: The (111) plane in a cubic unit cell has a normal vector \\(\\mathbf{n} = [1, 1, 1]\\). This means that any direction vector \\(\\mathbf{d}\\) that lies in this plane must satisfy the dot product condition \\(\\mathbf{n} \\cdot \\mathbf{d} = 0\\).\n\n2. **Identify the direction vector**: The [110] type direction means a direction vector \\(\\mathbf{d} = [1, 1, 0]\\) or any scalar multiple of it. We need to check if this direction vector lies in the (111) plane. The dot product of \\(\\mathbf{n} = [1, 1, 1]\\) and \\(\\mathbf{d} = [1, 1, 0]\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\mathbf{n} \\cdot \\mathbf{d} = 1 \\cdot 1 + 1 \\cdot 1 + 1 \\cdot 0 = 2 \\neq 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\([110]\\) is not a direction in the (111) plane. However, we need to find the directions that are in the (111) plane and are of the [110] type. This means we need to find the projection of the [110] type direction onto the (111) plane.\n\n3. **Find the projection**: The projection of a vector \\(\\mathbf{d}\\) onto a plane with normal vector \\(\\mathbf{n}\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\mathbf{d}_{\\text{plane}} = \\mathbf{d} - \\frac{\\mathbf{d} \\cdot \\mathbf{n}}{\\mathbf{n} \\cdot \\mathbf{n}} \\mathbf{n}\n   \\]\n   For \\(\\mathbf{d} = [1, 1, 0]\\), we have:\n   \\[\n   \\mathbf{d} \\cdot \\mathbf{n} = 1 \\cdot 1 + 1 \\cdot 1 + 0 \\cdot 1 = 2\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\mathbf{n} \\cdot \\mathbf{n} = 1 \\cdot 1 + 1 \\cdot 1 + 1 \\cdot 1 = 3\n   \\]\n   So,\n   \\[\n   \\mathbf{d}_{\\text{plane}} = [1, 1, 0] - \\frac{2}{3} [1, 1, 1] = [1, 1, 0] - \\left[\\frac{2}{3}, \\frac{2}{3}, \\frac{2}{3}\\right] = \\left[\\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{1}{3}, -\\frac{2}{3}\\right]\n   \\]\n   This vector \\(\\left[\\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{1}{3}, -\\frac{2}{3}\\right]\\) is a direction in the (111) plane. However, we need to find all possible directions of the [110] type that lie in the (111) plane. These directions are all the scalar multiples of \\(\\left[\\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{1}{3}, -\\frac{2}{3}\\right]\\), which can be written as \\([1, 1, -2]\\) after scaling by 3.\n\n4. **Determine the number of unique directions**: The [110] type directions in the (111) plane are all the scalar multiples of \\([1, 1, -2]\\). Since we are considering directions, we can take the unique direction \\([1, 1, -2]\\) and its permutations that are not scalar multiples of each other. However, in a cubic lattice, the [110] type directions are unique up to sign changes and permutations, and there are exactly 3 unique directions in the (111) plane that are [110] type directions.\n\nTherefore, the number of different [110]-type directions that lie in the (111) plane is \\(\\boxed{3}\\)."

            "To calculate the planar packing fraction of the (110) plane for aluminum at 300 K, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the lattice parameter of aluminum.\n2. Determine the number of atoms in the (110) plane.\n3. Determine the area of the (110) plane.\n4. Determine the area occupied by the atoms in the (110) plane.\n5. Calculate the planar packing fraction.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the lattice parameter of aluminum\nThe lattice parameter of aluminum (Al) is approximately \\( a = 4.04 \\) Angstrons.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the number of atoms in the (110) plane\nThe (110) plane in a cubic lattice of aluminum has a unit cell that is a rectangle with a length of \\( a \\) and a width of \\( a \\). The (110) plane intersects the lattice points at the following positions: (0,0,0), (1,1,0), (2,2,0), etc. The number of atoms in the (110) plane is 2 (one at (0,0,0) and one at (1,1,0)).\n\n### Step 3: Determine the area of the (110) plane\nThe area of the (110) plane is the area of the rectangle formed by the lattice points. The length of the rectangle is \\( a \\) and the width is \\( a \\sqrt{2} \\) (since the plane is at a 45-degree angle to the lattice planes).

The radius of each atom is \\( \\frac{a}{2} \\). The area occupied by one atom is the area of a circle with radius \\( \\frac{a}{2} \\):\n\\[ A_{\\text{ atom}} = \\pi \\left( \\frac{a}{2} \\right)^2 = \\frac{\\pi a^2}{4} \\]\nSince there are 2 atoms in the (110) plane, the total area occupied by the atoms is:\n\\[ A_{\\text{ atoms}} = 2 \\times \\frac{\\pi a^2}{4} = \\frac{\\pi a^2}{2} \\]\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the planar packing fraction\nThe planar packing fraction is the ratio of the area occupied by the atoms to the area of the (110) plane:\n\\[ \\text{Packing fraction} = \\frac{A_{\\text{ atoms}}}{A_{\\text{plane}}} = \\frac{\\frac{\\pi a^2}{2}}{a^2 \\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{\\pi}{2 \\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{\\pi \\sqrt{2}}{4} \\]\nUsing the value of \\( \\pi \\approx 3.14159 \\) and \\( \\sqrt{2} \\approx 1.414 \\):\n\\[ \\text{Packing fraction} = \\frac{3.14159 \\times 1.414}{4} \\approx \\frac{4.4429}{4} \\approx 1.1107 \\approx 0.786 \\]\n\nTherefore, the planar packing fraction of the (110) plane for aluminum at 300 K is:\n\\[ \\boxed{0.786} \\]"

We are given the hyperization fractions at two different temperatures, but we can use the enthalpy of hyperization at the melting point as the reference temperature because it is a well-known value.\n\nThe enthalpy of hyperization at the melting point is typically taken as zero, so \\(\\Delta H_{\\text{v}}^{\\circ} = 0\\).

The enthalpy of hyperization at the high temperature can be calculated using the difference in the hyperization fractions at the two temperatures and the enthalpy of hyperization at the melting point.\n\nFirst, we need to find the enthalpy of hyperization at the high temperature.

            "To determine the donor concentration in the bulk germanium, we need to use Fick's first law of diffusional mass transfer.

            "To determine the differences in relative electronegativity \\(\\Delta x\\) in \\(e V\\) for the systems \\({H}-{F}\\) and \\({C}-{F}\\), we need to use the bond energy data provided. The bond energy of a molecule is related to the electronegativity difference between the atoms in the bond. The general relationship is that the bond energy of a bond between two atoms is proportional to the electronegativity difference between the two atoms. Specifically, the bond energy \\(E\\) can be approximated by the formula:\n\n\\[ E \\approx k \\Delta x \\]\n\nwhere \\(k\\) is a proportionality constant. For simplicity, we can use the fact that the bond energy is approximately proportional to the electronegativity difference, and we can use the bond energies directly to find the electronegativity differences.\n\nFirst, let's find the electronegativity difference for the system \\({H}-{F}\\). The bond energy of the \\({H}-{F}\\) bond is 565 kJ\/mol. We need to find the electronegativity difference \\(\\Delta x_{HF}\\) such that:\n\n\\[ 565 \\approx k \\Delta x_{HF} \\]\n\nWe can use the bond energy of the \\({F}_{2}\\) molecule, which is 172 kJ\/mol, to find the proportionality constant \\(k\\). The bond energy of a molecule is approximately equal to the sum of the electronegativity differences of all the bonds in the molecule. For a diatomic molecule, the bond energy is approximately equal to twice the electronegativity difference between the two atoms. Therefore, we can write:\n\n\\[ 172 \\approx 2k \\Delta x_{F} \\]\n\nwhere \\(\\Delta x_{F}\\) is the electronegativity difference for a single \\({F}-F\\) bond. Solving for \\(k \\Delta x_{F}\\), we get:\n\n\\[ k \\Delta x_{F} = \\frac{172}{2} = 86 \\]\n\nNow, we can use this value of \\(k \\Delta x_{F}\\) to find the electronegativity difference for the \\({H}-{F}\\) bond:\n\n\\[ 565 \\approx k \\Delta x_{HF} \\]\n\\[ \\Delta x_{HF} = \\frac{565}{k \\Delta x_{F}} = \\frac{565}{86} \\approx 6.54 \\]\n\nNext, let's find the electronegativity difference for the system \\({C}-{F}\\). The bond energy of the \\({C}-{F}\\) bond is not directly given, but we can use the bond energy of the \\({C}-{C}\\) bond, which is 335 kJ\/mol, to find the proportionality constant \\(k\\). The bond energy of a molecule is approximately equal to the sum of the electronegativity differences of all the bonds in the molecule. For a diatomic molecule, the bond energy is approximately equal to twice the electronegativity difference between the two atoms. Therefore, we can write:\n\n\\[ 335 \\approx 2k \\Delta x_{C} \\]\n\nwhere \\(\\Delta x_{C}\\) is the electronegativity difference for a single \\({C}-C\\) bond. Solving for \\(k \\Delta x_{C}\\), we get:\n\n\\[ k \\Delta x_{C} = \\frac{335}{2} = 167.5 \\]\n\nNow, we can use this value of \\(k \\Delta x_{C}\\) to find the electronegativity difference for the \\({C}-{F}\\) bond. The bond energy of the \\({C}-{F}\\) bond is not directly given, but we can use the bond energy of the \\({H}-{F}\\) bond as a reference. The bond energy of the \\({C}-{F}\\) bond is approximately the sum of the electronegativity differences of the \\({C}-C\\) bond and the \\({C}-F\\) bond. Therefore, we can write:\n\n\\[ E_{CF} \\approx k \\Delta x_{C} + k \\Delta x_{HF} \\]\n\\[ E_{CF} \\approx 167.5 + 6.54 = 174.04 \\]\n\nNow, we can find the electronegativity difference for the \\({C}-{F}\\) bond:\n\n\\[ E_{CF} \\approx k \\Delta x_{CF} \\]\n\\[ \\Delta x_{CF} = \\frac{E_{CF}}{k} = \\frac{174.04}{167.5} \\approx 1.04 \\]\n\nFinally, the difference in relative electronegativity \\(\\Delta x\\) in \\(e V\\) for the systems \\({H}-{F}\\) and \\({C}-{F}\\) is:\n\n\\[ \\Delta x = \\Delta x_{HF} - \\Delta x_{CF} = 6.54 - 1.04 = 5.50 \\]\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{5.50}\n\\]"

The total demand for apples in a day is 150 apples when the price is 75 cents per apple.\n\nLet's denote the price of apples by \\( p \\) cents. The local orchard will produce up to 50 apples at a price of \\( p \\) cents, and the store will produce the remaining apples at a price of 75 cents per apple.

Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n\\[ MR = MC \\]\n\nIn terms of the variables we have, the marginal revenue is the derivative of the total revenue with respect to quantity, and the marginal cost is the derivative of the total cost with respect to quantity. Therefore, the condition for profit maximization can be written as:\n\\[ \\frac{d(PQ)}{dQ} = \\frac{dC}{dQ} \\]\n\\[ P = MC \\]\n\nHere, \\( P \\) is the price of the product, and \\( MC \\) is the marginal cost of production. This condition states that the price at which the firm sells its product should be equal to the cost of producing the last unit of output.\n\nIn standard acronyms, this condition is often referred to as the \" break-even condition \" or the \" profit\u6700\u5927\u5316 condition \".\n\nThus, the algebraic condition that describes a firm that is at an output level that maximizes its profits, given its capital in the short-term, is:\n\\[ \\boxed{P = MC} \\]"

The structure of benzene is a planar ring with alternating single and double bonds. The Hund's rule states that the lowest energy configuration is the one with the maximum number of parallel electrons in the pi orbitals. For benzene, this means the structure with the double bonds broken to form individual pi bonds.\n\nThe energy of benzene can be calculated using the Hund's rule and the given values of \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\). The energy of each pi bond is \\(\\beta = -0.7 \\text{ eV}\\), and there are 3 pi bonds in the ring. Additionally, there is a J-coupling energy \\(\\alpha = -11.2 \\text{ eV}\\) between each pair of adjacent double bonds.\n\nThe ground state energy of benzene can be approximated as:\n\n\\[ E(\\text{B}) = 3\\beta + 3\\alpha = 3(-0.7) + 3(-11.2) = -2.1 - 33.6 = -35.7 \\text{ eV} \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine the ground state energy of benzene with one electron removed, \\( E(\\text{B}^+) \\). When one electron is removed, the system becomes less stable, and the energy increases. The energy change due to the removal of one electron can be estimated using the Hund's rule and the J-coupling energy. The energy change is approximately equal to the energy of the pi bond, which is \\(\\beta = -0.7 \\text{ eV}\\).\n\nTherefore, the ground state energy of benzene with one electron removed is:\n\n\\[ E(\\text{B}^+) = E(\\text{B}) + \\beta = -35.7 + (-0.7) = -36.4 \\text{ eV} \\]\n\nFinally, the ionization potential of benzene is:\n\n\\[ \\text{IP} = E(\\text{B}^+) - E(\\text{B}) = -36.4 - (-35.7) = -36.4 + 35.7 = -0.7 \\text{ eV} \\]\n\nThus, the ionization potential of benzene is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{36.4} \\]"

The energy levels of the Hamiltonian \\(H\\) are then:\n\n\\[\nE_v = \\hbar \\omega \\left( v + \\frac{1}{2} \\right) + E_0 \\sqrt{\\frac{m k}{2 \\hbar}} \\left( \\hat{a} + \\hat{a}^\\dagger \\right)\n\\]\n\nHowever, we need to find the expectation value of \\(\\hat{a} + \\hat{a}^\\dagger\\) in the eigenstate of the Hamiltonian \\(H'\\). The expectation value of \\(\\hat{a} + \\hat{a}^\\dagger\\) in the eigenstate of the Hamiltonian \\(H'\\) is simply \\(2 \\sqrt{\\frac{m k}{2 \\hbar}} E_0\\).

Therefore, we have \\(\\alpha = \\frac{5}{2} \\beta\\).\n\nNext, we find the energy shift to second order:\n\\[\nE_{\\widetilde{10}}^{(2)} = \\left\\langle \\widetilde{10} \\right| \\mathbf{H}_1^2 \\left| \\widetilde{10} \\right\\rangle\n\\]\nExpanding this, we get:\n\\[\nE_{\\widetilde{10}}^{(2)} = \\beta^2 \\left\\langle -10 \\right| \\mathbf{H}_1^2 \\left| -10 \\right\\rangle + \\alpha^2 \\left\\langle 10 \\right| \\mathbf{H}_1^2 \\left| 10 \\right\\rangle + 2 \\alpha \\beta \\left\\langle -10 \\right| \\mathbf{H}_1 \\left| 10 \\right\\rangle\n\\]\nUsing the matrix elements of \\(\\mathbf{H}_1\\), we get:\n\\[\nE_{\\widetilde{10}}^{(2)} = \\beta^2 (100) + \\alpha^2 (0) + 2 \\alpha \\beta (4) = 100 \\beta^2 + 8 \\alpha \\beta\n\\]\nSubstituting \\(\\alpha = \\frac{5}{2} \\beta\\), we get:\n\\[\nE_{\\widetilde{10}}^{(2)} = 100 \\beta^2 + 8 \\left(\\frac{5}{2} \\beta\\right) \\beta = 100 \\beta^2 + 20 \\beta^2 = 120 \\beta^2\n\\]\nThe energy shift to second order is:\n\\[\nE_{\\widetilde{10}} = E^{(0)} + E_{\\widetilde{10}}^{(1)} + E_{\\widetilde{10}}^{(2)} = 0 + 0 + 120 \\beta^2 = 120 \\beta^2\n\\]\nSince \\(\\beta\\) is a small parameter, we can use the fact that the energy shift to first order is zero, and the energy shift to second order is the dominant contribution. Therefore, the energy shift to second order is:\n\\[\nE_{\\widetilde{10}} = 120 \\left(\\frac{1}{10}\\right)^2 = 1.2\n\\]\nThus, the energy \\(E_{\\widetilde{10}}\\) is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{0.2}\n\\]"
