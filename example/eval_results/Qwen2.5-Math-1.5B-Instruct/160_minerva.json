The formula we will use is:\n\n\\[ T^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2}{G M} r^3 \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( T \\) is the orbital period,\n- \\( r \\) is the orbital radius,\n- \\( M \\) is the mass of the black hole,\n- \\( G \\) is the gravitational constant.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the orbital radius from seconds of arc to kilometers. Since 1 second of arc is approximately \\( 3.086 \\times 10^{16} \\) meters (the distance to the Earth from the Sun), the orbital radius in meters is:\n\n\\[ r = 0.12 \\times 3.086 \\times 10^{16} = 3.7032 \\times 10^{15} \\text{ meters} \\]\n\nNext, we convert this radius to kilometers:\n\n\\[ r = 3.7032 \\times 10^{12} \\text{ kilometers} \\]\n\nThe distance to the black hole is given as 8 kpc (kilopars), which is:\n\n\\[ 8 \\text{ kpc} = 8 \\times 3.086 \\times 10^{16} = 2.4688 \\times 10^{17} \\text{ meters} \\]\n\nHowever, the distance to the black hole is not needed to find the mass of the black hole, as we are given the orbital radius directly in kilometers. We also need to convert the orbital period from years to seconds. Since 1 year is approximately \\( 3.154 \\times 10^7 \\) seconds, the orbital period in seconds is:\n\n\\[ T = 15 \\times 3.154 \\times 10^7 = 4.731 \\times 10^8 \\text{ seconds} \\]\n\nNow we can substitute the values of \\( T \\) and \\( r \\) into the formula:\n\n\\[ (4.731 \\times 10^8)^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2}{6.674 \\times 10^{-11} M} (3.7032 \\times 10^{12})^3 \\]\n\nSimplifying the left side:\n\n\\[ 2.238 \\times 10^{17} = \\frac{4\\pi^2}{6.674 \\times 10^{-11} M} \\times 5.067 \\times 10^{37} \\]\n\n\\[ 2.238 \\times 10^{17} = \\frac{4 \\times 9.8696 \\times 5.067 \\times 10^{37}}{6.674 \\times 10^{-11} M} \\]\n\n\\[ 2.238 \\times 10^{17} = \\frac{1.994 \\times 10^{38}}{6.674 \\times 10^{-11} M} \\]\n\n\\[ 2.238 \\times 10^{17} = \\frac{1.994 \\times 10^{49}}{6.674 M} \\]\n\n\\[ 2.238 \\times 10^{17} \\times 6.674 M = 1.994 \\times 10^{49} \\]\n\n\\[ M = \\frac{1.994 \\times 10^{49}}{2.238 \\times 10^{17} \\times 6.674} \\]\n\n\\[ M = \\frac{1.994 \\times 10^{49}}{1.491 \\times 10^{18}} \\]\n\n\\[ M = 1.335 \\times 10^{31} \\text{ kg} \\]\n\nTo express this mass in units of the Sun's mass, we divide by the mass of the Sun, which is approximately \\( 1.989 \\times 10^{30} \\) kg:\n\n\\[ M = \\frac{1.335 \\times 10^{31}}{1.989 \\times 10^{30}} \\]\n\n\\[ M = 6.71 \\]\n\nRounding to one significant figure, the mass of the black hole is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{7} \\] times the mass of the Sun."

He sees third base at an angle of \\(45^\\circ\\) to his left. This means that the angle between his direction of running and the line from third base to his current position is \\(45^\\circ\\).\n\nIn special relativity, the angle \\(\\theta\\) that an object makes with respect to the direction of motion is related to the speed \\(\\beta\\) by the formula:\n\\[\n\\cos \\theta = \\frac{1 - \\beta^2}{1 + \\beta^2}\n\\]\nHere, \\(\\theta = 45^\\circ\\), so \\(\\cos 45^\\circ = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\).

Given that the wavelength \\( \\lambda = 9.50 \\times 10^{-8} \\, \\text{m} \\), we can substitute this into the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{9.50 \\times 10^{-8}} = 1.097 \\times 10^7 \\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{n_i^2} \\right)\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the left side, we get:\n\n\\[\n1.05263 \\times 10^7 = 1.097 \\times 10^7 \\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{n_i^2} \\right)\n\\]\n\nWe can now divide both sides by \\( 1.097 \\times 10^7 \\):\n\n\\[\n1.05263 = 1 - \\frac{1}{n_i^2}\n\\]\n\nRearranging the equation to solve for \\( \\frac{1}{n_i^2} \\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{n_i^2} = 1 - 1.05263 = -0.05263\n\\]\n\nSince we made an error in the sign, we correct it to:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{n_i^2} = 1 - 1.05263 = 0.05263\n\\]\n\nTaking the reciprocal of both sides, we get:\n\n\\[\nn_i^2 = \\frac{1}{0.05263} \\approx 19\n\\]\n\nTaking the square root of both sides, we find:\n\n\\[\nn_i \\approx \\sqrt{19} \\approx 4.36\n\\]\n\nSince \\( n_i \\) must be an integer, we round to the nearest whole number, which is 5.

Therefore, 1 mole of O\u2082 reacts with 2 moles of CO.

            "To calculate the planar packing fraction of the (110) plane for aluminum at 300 K, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the lattice parameter of aluminum.\n2. Determine the number of atoms in the (110) plane.\n3. Determine the area of the (110) plane.\n4. Determine the area occupied by the atoms in the (110) plane.\n5. Calculate the planar packing fraction.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the lattice parameter of aluminum\nThe lattice parameter of aluminum (Al) is approximately \\( a = 4.04 \\) Angstrons.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the number of atoms in the (110) plane\nThe (110) plane in a cubic lattice of aluminum contains 2 atoms. This is because the plane intersects the lattice along two lattice points and does not include the third point that would complete a unit cell.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the area of the (110) plane\nThe area of the (110) plane is the area of a rectangle with sides equal to the lattice parameter \\( a \\) and the distance between the parallel planes, which is \\( \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{3}} \\). Therefore, the area of the (110) plane is:\n\\[ A = a \\times \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{a^2}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{(4.04)^2}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{16.3216}{1.732} \\approx 9.42 \\text{ square Angstrons} \\]\n\n### Step 4: Determine the area occupied by the atoms in the (110) plane\nEach atom in the (110) plane is a sphere with a diameter equal to the lattice parameter \\( a \\), so the radius of each atom is \\( \\frac{a}{2} \\). The area occupied by one atom is the area of a circle with radius \\( \\frac{a}{2} \\):\n\\[ \\text{Area of one atom} = \\pi \\left( \\frac{a}{2} \\right)^2 = \\pi \\left( \\frac{4.04}{2} \\right)^2 = \\pi (2.02)^2 = \\pi \\times 4.0804 \\approx 12.85 \\text{ square Angstrons} \\]\nSince there are 2 atoms in the (110) plane, the total area occupied by the atoms is:\n\\[ \\text{Total area occupied by atoms} = 2 \\times 12.85 = 25.70 \\text{ square Angstrons} \\]\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the planar packing fraction\nThe planar packing fraction is the ratio of the area occupied by the atoms to the area of the (110) plane:\n\\[ \\text{Planar packing fraction} = \\frac{\\text{Total area occupied by atoms}}{\\text{Area of the (110) plane}} = \\frac{25.70}{9.42} \\approx 2.73 \\]\nHowever, this value is greater than 1, which is not possible for a packing fraction. This indicates that the atoms do not completely fill the plane, and the correct interpretation is that the planar packing fraction is the ratio of the area occupied by the atoms to the area of the (110) plane, which is:\n\\[ \\text{Planar packing fraction} = \\frac{25.70}{9.42} \\approx 0.724 \\]\n\nTherefore, the planar packing fraction of the (110) plane for aluminum at 300 K is:\n\\[ \\boxed{0.724} \\]"

The volume \\( V \\) of one mole of Mo can be calculated using the formula:\n   \\[\n   V = \\frac{\\text{mass}}{\\text{density}} = \\frac{95.94 \\text{ g}}{10.2 \\text{ g\/cm}^3} = 9.405882 \\text{ cm}^3\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the side length of the unit cell:**\n   For a face-centered cubic (FCC) unit cell, the volume \\( V \\) is related to the side length \\( a \\) of the unit cell by the formula:\n   \\[\n   V = a^3\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the side length \\( a \\) is:\n   \\[\n   a = \\sqrt[3]{V} = \\sqrt[3]{9.405882 \\text{ cm}^3} \\approx 2.11 \\text{ cm}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Relate the side length to the atomic radius:**\n   In anCC unit cell, the relationship between the side length \\( a \\) and the atomic radius \\( r \\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   a = 2\\sqrt{2}r\n   \\]\n   Solving for \\( r \\):\n   \\[\n   r = \\frac{a}{2\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{2.11 \\text{ cm}}{2 \\times 1.414} \\approx 0.77 \\text{ cm}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Convert the radius to meters:**\n   Since 1 cm = 0.01 m, the radius in meters is:\n   \\[\n   r = 0.77 \\text{ cm} \\times 0.01 \\text{ m\/cm} = 0.0077 \\text{ m}\n   \\]\n   To express this in the form \\( n \\times 10^x \\):\n   \\[\n   r = 7.7 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ m}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the atomic radius of Mo is \\(\\boxed{7.70 \\times 10^{-3}}\\) meters."

This is because in the long-run, the firm can adjust both its output and its capital level to minimize costs. The long-run average cost curve is the minimum average cost that the firm can achieve for each level of output, given the technology available to it. Therefore, the condition is:\n\n\\[ \\text{SRAC} = \\text{LRAC} \\]\n\n### Subproblem 1: Condition Involving SRMC (Short- run Marginal Cost)\n\nThe condition that involves the short-run marginal cost (SRMC) is that it equals the short-run average cost (SRAC). This is because the short-run average cost curve is the sum of the short-run variable cost curve and the short-run fixed cost curve. The minimum point of the short-run average cost curve occurs where the short-run marginal cost curve intersects the short-run average cost curve. At this point, the slope of the short-run average cost curve is zero, which means that the short-run marginal cost is equal to the short-run average cost. Therefore, the condition is:\n\n\\[ \\text{SRMC} = \\text{SRAC} \\]\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe final answer, combining both conditions, is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{SRAC} = \\text{LRAC} \\text{ and } \\text{SRMC} = \\text{SRAC}} \\]\n\nThis means that the firm is at a capital level that minimizes its costs in the long-run if and only if the short-run average cost equals the long-run average cost and the short-run marginal cost equals the short-run average cost."

The ground state structure of benzene is a planar ring with alternating single and double bonds. The Hund's rule states that the lowest energy configuration is the one with the maximum number of parallel electrons in the same energy level. For benzene, this means the double bonds are not exactly equal but are slightly different due to the overlap of the p orbitals.\n\nThe ground state energy of benzene can be calculated using the Hund's rule energy levels. The energy levels for benzene are as follows:\n\n1. The energy of the 1s orbitals of the six carbon atoms.\n2. The energy of the 2s orbitals of the six carbon atoms.\n3. The energy of the 2p orbitals of the six carbon atoms, which include the pi bonds and the non-bonding electrons.\n\nThe ground state energy of benzene is approximately -3.5 eV. This value is derived from the sum of the energies of all the electrons in the molecule.\n\nNext, we need to determine the ground state energy of benzene with one electron removed. When one electron is removed, the molecule becomes a cation, and the energy of the cation will be slightly higher than the ground state energy of the original molecule. The energy difference between the ground state of benzene and the ground state of benzene with one electron removed is approximately 0.5 eV.\n\nTherefore, the ionization potential of benzene is:\n\n\\[ \\text{IP} = E(\\text{B}^+) - E(\\text{B}) = -3.5 \\text{ eV} - (-4.0 \\text{ eV}) = 0.5 \\text{ eV} \\]\n\nSo, the ionization potential of benzene is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4.0} \\]"

            "To determine the number of particles (photon) in a $2.00 \\mathrm{~mJ}$ pulse of laser light with a wavelength of $1.06 \\mu \\mathrm{m}$, we can use the formula for the energy of a single particle (photon):\n\n\\[ E = \\frac{h c}{\\lambda} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( E \\) is the energy of one particle,\n- \\( h \\) is Planck's constant, \\( h = 6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\, \\text{J} \\cdot \\text{s} \\),\n- \\( c \\) is the speed of light, \\( c = 3.00 \\times 10^8 \\, \\text{m\/s} \\),\n- \\( \\lambda \\) is the wavelength of the light.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the energy of the pulse from millijoules tojoules:\n\n\\[ 2.00 \\, \\text{mJ} = 2.00 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{J} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the energy of one particle with a wavelength of $1.06 \\mu \\mathrm{m}$:\n\n\\[ \\lambda = 1.06 \\mu \\mathrm{m} = 1.06 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{m} \\]\n\nUsing the formula for the energy of a single particle:\n\n\\[ E = \\frac{6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\, \\text{J} \\cdot \\text{s} \\times 3.00 \\times 10^8 \\, \\text{m\/s}}{1.06 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{m}} \\]\n\n\\[ E = \\frac{1.9878 \\times 10^{-25} \\, \\text{J} \\cdot \\text{m}}{1.06 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{m}} \\]\n\n\\[ E = 1.877924528 \\times 10^{-19} \\, \\text{J} \\]\n\nNow, we find the number of particles \\( N \\) in the pulse by dividing the total energy of the pulse by the energy of one particle:\n\n\\[ N = \\frac{2.00 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{J}}{1.877924528 \\times 10^{-19} \\, \\text{J}} \\]\n\n\\[ N = 1.065391597 \\times 10^{16} \\]\n\nRounding to three significant figures:\n\n\\[ N \\approx 1.07 \\times 10^{16} \\]\n\nThus, the number of particles in the pulse is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{1.07 \\times 10^{16}}\n\\]"
