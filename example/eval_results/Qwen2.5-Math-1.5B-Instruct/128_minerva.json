The mass enclosed within radius \\( r \\) is given by the integral of the density over the volume:\n\\[\nM(r) = \\int_0^r 4 \\pi r'^2 \\rho(r') \\, dr'.\n\\]\nSubstituting the given density distribution \\( \\rho(r) = \\rho_0 \\left( \\frac{r_0}{r} \\right)^2 \\), we get:\n\\[\nM(r) = \\int_0^r 4 \\pi r'^2 \\rho_0 \\left( \\frac{r_0}{r'} \\right)^2 \\, dr' = 4 \\pi \\rho_0 r_0^2 \\int_0^r \\frac{r'^2}{r'^2} \\, dr' = 4 \\pi \\rho_0 r_0^2 \\int_0^r \\, dr' = 4 \\pi \\rho_0 r_0^2 r.\n\\]\nSo, the mass enclosed within radius \\( r \\) is:\n\\[\nM(r) = 4 \\pi \\rho_0 r_0^2 r.\n\\]\nSubstituting this into the expression for the rotation curve, we get:\n\\[\nv(r) = \\sqrt{\\frac{G \\cdot 4 \\pi \\rho_0 r_0^2 r}{r}} = \\sqrt{4 \\pi G \\rho_0 r_0^2}.\n\\]\nThus, the rotation curve of the galaxy at large distances is:\n\\[\nv(r) = \\sqrt{4 \\pi G \\rho_0 r_0^2} = 2 \\pi^{1\/2} \\sqrt{G \\rho_0 r_0^2}.\n\\]\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{2 \\pi^{1\/2} \\sqrt{G \\rho_0 r_0^2}}.\n\\]"

T[::-3) is an isotope of hydrogen with a atomic number of 1 and a mass number of 3. This means that a tritium atom has 1proton and 2 down quarks in its nucleus.\n\nThe atomic number of an element is the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom of that element. For tritium, the atomic number is 1, so it has 1proton. The mass number of an atom is the sum of the number of protons and the number ofneutrons in the nucleus. For tritium, the mass number is 3, so the number ofneutrons is calculated as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number ofneutrons} = \\text{Mass number} - \\text{Atomic number} = 3 - 1 = 2\n\\]\n\nIn addition to the down quarks, the up quark and the down quark make up the hadron that is the tritium atom. However, the problem specifically asks for the number of down quarks. Since each down quark is part of a hadron (a baryon in this case), and the tritium atom is composed of 1proton and 2 down quarks, the number of down quarks in a tritium atom is 2.\n\nThus, the number of down quarks in a tritium nucleus is \\(\\boxed{2}\\)."

            "To determine the age of the universe when most hadrons were formed in minutes, we need to use the current age of the universe and the time it took for hadrons to form. The current age of the universe is approximately 13.8 billion years. The hadrons were formed when the temperature of the universe was high enough to allow hadrons to form, which is around 1 second after the big expansion.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the age of the universe from years to seconds. There are 365.25 days in a year, 24 hours in a day, 60 minutes in an hour, and 60 seconds in a minute. Therefore, the number of seconds in a year is:\n\n\\[ 365.25 \\times 24 \\times 60 \\times 60 = 31,557,600 \\text{ seconds} \\]\n\nSo, the age of the universe in seconds is:\n\n\\[ 13.8 \\times 10^9 \\text{ years} \\times 31,557,600 \\text{ seconds\/year} = 432,452,448,000,000 \\text{ seconds} \\]\n\nNext, we need to convert this time into minutes. There are 60 seconds in a minute, so:\n\n\\[ 432,452,448,000,000 \\text{ seconds} \\div 60 \\text{ seconds\/minute} = 7,207,540,800,000 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nNow, we need to express this time to the nearest power of 10. The number 7,207,540,800,000 is between \\(10^7\\) and \\(10^8\\). To determine which power of 10 it is closer to, we can compare it to \\(10^7 = 10,000,000\\) and \\(10^8 = 100,000,000\\). Since 7,207,540,800,000 is closer to \\(10^8\\) than to \\(10^7\\), we round it to \\(10^8\\).\n\nTherefore, the age of the universe when most hadrons were formed is approximately:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{7.2 \\times 10^8 \\text{ minutes}} \\]"

However, without specific information about the nature of argillic, we can assume it is a strong base, such as sodiumargillic (NaA).\n\n2. **Determine the charge of the salt**: A strong base like sodiumargillic (NaA) is composed of a cation (sodium, Na+) and an anion (argon, A-). In solution, the cation (Na+) is always positive and the anion (A-) is always negative. Therefore, the salt NaA will always be neutral in terms of charge when it is fully dissociated in water.\n\n3. **Effect of pH on the charge**: The pH of the solution does not affect the net charge of the salt. The net charge of a salt is determined by the charges of the cation and anion that form it, not by the concentration of hydrogen ions (H+) or hydroxide ions (OH-). In this case, the net charge of NaA is zero because the positive charge from Na+ is exactly balanced by the negative charge from A-.\n\nTherefore, the net charge of argillic in a solution of pH 1.0 is \\(\\boxed{0}\\)."

However, the problem states that the material is pure and does not exhibit any impurities ordopants, so it must be a conductor or an insulating material. Since it appears red in transmitted light, it is most likely a conductor.\n\nThe band gap of a conductor is typically very small, and for a pure conductor, the band gap is close to zero. However, since the problem specifies that the material is a purewaxine material and it appears red in transmitted light, it is most likely a conductor with a small band gap. The band gap of a purewaxine material is typically around 0.7 eV for a conductor.\n\nTherefore, the approximate band gap \\( E_g \\) for this material is \\(\\boxed{1.1}\\) eV."

            "To determine the wavelength of the photoemission generated by the interaction of the EM radiation with the Germanium crystal, we can use the relationship between the frequency of the EM radiation, the work function of the material, and the wavelength of the photoemission.

            "To determine the linear density of atoms along the <110> direction in barium (Ba), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the lattice parameters**: Barium has a body center cubic (BCC) structure. The lattice parameter (side length of the cubic unit cell) for barium is approximately \\( a = 0.3524 \\) nm.\n\n2. **Determine the coordinates of the atoms in the <110> direction**: The <110> direction in a BCC structure can be represented by the vectors \\(\\mathbf{a} = (1, 1, 0)\\) and \\(\\mathbf{b} = (1, 0, 1)\\). The unit vector in the <110> direction is \\(\\mathbf{u} = \\frac{\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{b}}{\\|\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{b}\\|} = \\left( \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{6}}, \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{6}}, \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{3}, \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{3}, \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{6} \\right)\\).\n\n3. **Find the coordinates of the atoms along the <110> direction**: The atoms in the BCC structure are located at the corners of the cube.

Therefore, the linear density is \\(\\frac{2}{a\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{2}{0.3524 \\sqrt{2}} \\approx \\frac{2}{0.497} \\approx 4.02 \\) atoms\/nm.\n\n7. **Convert the linear density to atoms\/m**: Since 1 meter = 10^9 nanometers, the linear density in atoms\/m is \\(4.02 \\times 10^9\\) atoms\/m.\n\nThus, the linear density of atoms along the <110> direction in barium is \\(\\boxed{4.02 \\times 10^9}\\) atoms\/m."

            "To determine how many different [110]-type directions lie in the (111) plane in an cubic unit cell (U cell), we need to understand the relationship between the plane and the direction in the context of the cubic lattice.\n\n1. **Identify the plane and its normal vector:**\n   The (111) plane in a cubic unit cell has a normal vector \\(\\mathbf{n} = [1, 1, 1]\\). This means that any direction in the plane must be perpendicular to this normal vector.\n\n2. **Identify the direction and its components:**\n   The [110] type direction means that the direction vector can be written as \\(\\mathbf{d} = [1, 1, 0]\\) or any scalar multiple of this vector. This direction is along the [110] plane family, which means it lies in the plane and is perpendicular to the normal vector of the plane.\n\n3. **Check if the direction vector is perpendicular to the normal vector:**\n   To verify that the [110] type direction lies in the (111) plane, we need to check if the dot product of \\(\\mathbf{d}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{n}\\) is zero:\n   \\[\n   \\mathbf{d} \\cdot \\mathbf{n} = [1, 1, 0] \\cdot [1, 1, 1] = 1 \\cdot 1 + 1 \\cdot 1 + 0 \\cdot 1 = 1 + 1 + 0 = 2 \\neq 0\n   \\]\n   This shows that the [110] type direction is not in the (111) plane. However, we need to find the directions that are in the (111) plane and are of the [110] type. The correct approach is to find the intersection of the (111) plane with the [110] family.\n\n4. **Find the intersection:**\n   The [110] type direction can be written as \\(\\mathbf{d} = [1, 1, 0]\\) or any scalar multiple of this vector. We need to find the intersection of this direction with the (111) plane. The (111) plane equation is:\n   \\[\n   x + y + z = 0\n   \\]\n   Substituting \\(\\mathbf{d} = [1, 1, 0]\\) into the plane equation:\n   \\[\n   1 + 1 + 0 = 2 \\neq 0\n   \\]\n   This shows that \\([1, 1, 0]\\) is not in the (111) plane. However, we need to find the directions that are in the (111) plane and are of the [110] type. The correct approach is to find the intersection of the (111) plane with the [110] family. The correct direction is \\([1, -1, 0]\\) or any scalar multiple of this vector. This direction is perpendicular to the normal vector of the (111) plane and lies in the (111) plane.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   The only direction that lies in the (111) plane and is of the [110] type is \\([1, -1, 0]\\) or any scalar multiple of this vector. Therefore, there is only one unique direction in the (111) plane that is of the [110] type.\n\nThe answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{1}\n\\]"

This is because the plane intersects the lattice along two lattice points and does not include the third point that would complete a unit cell.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the area of the (110) plane\nThe area of the (110) plane is the area of a rectangle with sides equal to the lattice parameter \\( a \\) and the distance between the parallel planes, which is \\( \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{2}} \\) for the (110) plane. Therefore, the area of the (110) plane is:\n\\[ A = a \\times \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{a^2}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{(4.04)^2}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{16.3216}{1.414} \\approx 11.58 \\text{ square Angstrons} \\]\n\n### Step 4: Determine the area occupied by the atoms in the (110) plane\nEach atom in the (110) plane is a sphere with a diameter equal to the lattice parameter \\( a \\), so the radius of each atom is \\( \\frac{a}{2} \\). The area occupied by one atom is the area of a circle with radius \\( \\frac{a}{2} \\):\n\\[ \\text{Area of one atom} = \\pi \\left( \\frac{a}{2} \\right)^2 = \\pi \\left( \\frac{4.04}{2} \\right)^2 = \\pi (2.02)^2 = 4.0804 \\pi \\approx 12.84 \\text{ square Angstrons} \\]\nSince there are 2 atoms in the (110) plane, the total area occupied by the atoms is:\n\\[ \\text{Total area occupied by atoms} = 2 \\times 4.0804 \\pi \\approx 2 \\times 12.84 = 25.68 \\text{ square Angstrons} \\]\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the planar packing fraction\nThe planar packing fraction is the ratio of the area occupied by the atoms to the area of the (110) plane:\n\\[ \\text{Planar packing fraction} = \\frac{\\text{Total area occupied by atoms}}{\\text{Area of the (110) plane}} = \\frac{25.68}{11.58} \\approx 2.21 \\]\nHowever, this value is greater than 1, which is not possible for a packing fraction. This indicates that the atoms do not completely fill the plane, and the correct interpretation is that the planar packing fraction is the ratio of the area occupied by the atoms to the area of the (110) plane, which is:\n\\[ \\text{Planar packing fraction} = \\frac{2 \\times \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\right) a^2}{\\frac{a^2}{\\sqrt{2}}} = \\frac{\\pi a^2 \/ 2}{a^2 \/ \\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{\\pi \\sqrt{2}}{2} \\approx 0.707 \\]\n\nTherefore, the planar packing fraction of the (110) plane for aluminum at 300 K is:\n\\[ \\boxed{0.707} \\]"

            "To determine the algebraic condition that describes a firm that is at an output level that maximizes its profits given its capital in the short-term, we need to use some basic principles from microeconmetry, particularly the concept of profit maximization.\n\n1. **Define the profit function**: The profit function for a firm is given by the difference between its total revenue (TR) and its total cost (TC). If we denote the output level by \\( Q \\), the profit function can be written as:\n   \\[\n   \\pi(Q) = TR(Q) - TC(Q)\n   \\]\n   where \\( TR(Q) \\) is the total revenue as a function of output \\( Q \\), and \\( TC(Q) \\) is the total cost as a function of output \\( Q \\).\n\n2. **First-order condition for profit maximization**: To find the output level that maximizes profit, we need to take the derivative of the profit function with respect to \\( Q \\) and set it equal to zero. This is because at the profit\u6700\u5927\u5316 output level, the slope of the profit function (which is the derivative of profit with respect to output) is zero. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d\\pi(Q)}{dQ} = \\frac{dTR(Q)}{dQ} - \\frac{dTC(Q)}{dQ} = 0\n   \\]\n   The derivative of total revenue with respect to output is the price (since \\( TR(Q) = P \\cdot Q \\) and \\( P \\) is the price per unit), and the derivative of total cost with respect to output is the marginal cost (since \\( TC(Q) \\) is the total cost function). Therefore, the first-order condition for profit maximization can be written as:\n   \\[\n   P = MC\n   \\]\n   where \\( P \\) is the price per unit and \\( MC \\) is the marginal cost.\n\n3. **AC and MC relationship**: Another way to express the condition for profit maximization is in terms of average cost (AC) and marginal cost (MC). The average cost is the total cost divided by the output level, and the marginal cost is the additional cost of producing one more unit of output. At the profit\u6700\u5927\u5316 output level, the price per unit is equal to the marginal cost, which is also equal to the average cost when the firm is at the minimum point of the average cost curve. However, the most common and general condition is the first-order condition \\( P = MC \\).\n\nTherefore, the algebraic condition that describes a firm that is at an output level that maximizes its profits, given its capital in the short-term, is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{P = MC}\n\\]"
