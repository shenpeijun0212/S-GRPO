The length of each line segment is given by \\(c_i = \\sqrt{a_i^2 + b_i^2}\\).\n\nThe condition for a line to be tangent to a circle is that the perpendicular distance from the center of the circle to the line is equal to the radius of the circle. The equation of the line passing through \\((0, a_i)\\) and \\((b_i, 0)\\) can be written as:\n\\[\n\\frac{x}{b_i} + \\frac{y}{a_i} = 1 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad a_i x + b_i y = a_i b_i.\n\\]\nThe perpendicular distance from the point \\((r, r)\\) to this line is given by:\n\\[\n\\frac{|a_i r + b_i r - a_i b_i|}{\\sqrt{a_i^2 + b_i^2}} = r.\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n|a_i r + b_i r - a_i b_i| = r \\sqrt{a_i^2 + b_i^2}.\n\\]\nSince \\(a_i\\) and \\(b_i\\) are positive integers, we can drop the absolute value and rearrange to get:\n\\[\na_i r + b_i r - a_i b_i = r \\sqrt{a_i^2 + b_i^2}.\n\\]\nDividing through by \\(r\\), we get:\n\\[\na_i + b_i - \\frac{a_i b_i}{r} = \\sqrt{a_i^2 + b_i^2}.\n\\]\nSquaring both sides, we obtain:\n\\[\n(a_i + b_i)^2 - 2a_i b_i \\left(1 + \\frac{a_i b_i}{r}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{a_i b_i}{r}\\right)^2 = a_i^2 + b_i^2.\n\\]\nSimplifying further, we get:\n\\[\na_i^2 + 2a_i b_i + b_i^2 - 2a_i b_i - \\frac{2a_i^2 b_i^2}{r} + \\frac{a_i^2 b_i^2}{r^2} = a_i^2 + b_i^2.\n\\]\nThis reduces to:\n\\[\n2a_i b_i - \\frac{2a_i^2 b_i^2}{r} + \\frac{a_i^2 b_i^2}{r^2} = 0.\n\\]\nMultiplying through by \\(r^2\\), we get:\n\\[\n2a_i b_i r^2 - 2a_i^2 b_i^2 r + a_i^2 b_i^2 = 0.\n\\]\nRearranging terms, we get:\n\\[\n2a_i b_i r^2 = 2a_i^2 b_i^2 r - a_i^2 b_i^2.\n\\]\nFactoring out \\(a_i^2 b_i^2\\) on the right side, we get:\n\\[\n2a_i b_i r^2 = a_i^2 b_i^2 (2r - 1).\n\\]\nDividing both sides by \\(a_i b_i\\), we get:\n\\[\n2r^2 = a_i b_i (2r - 1).\n\\]\nSolving for \\(a_i b_i\\), we get:\n\\[\na_i b_i = \\frac{2r^2}{2r - 1}.\n\\]\nFor \\(a_i b_i\\) to be an integer, \\(\\frac{2r^2}{2r - 1}\\) must be an integer. We need to find the smallest integer \\(r\\) such that \\(2r - 1\\) is a divisor of \\(2r^2\\). Testing small values of \\(r\\), we find:\n\\[\nr = 5 \\implies 2r - 1 = 9 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad 2r^2 = 50 \\implies \\frac{50}{9} \\quad \\text{(not an integer)}.\n\\]\n\\[\nr = 10 \\implies 2r - 1 = 19 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad 2r^2 = 200 \\implies \\frac{200}{19} \\quad \\text{(not an integer)}.\n\\]\n\\[\nr = 25 \\implies 2r - 1 = 49 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad 2r^2 = 1250 \\implies \\frac{1250}{49} \\quad \\text{(not an integer)}.\n\\]\n\\[\nr = 65 \\implies 2r - 1 = 129 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad 2r^2 = 8450 \\implies \\frac{8450}{129} = 65 \\quad \\text{(an integer)}.\n\\]\nSo, the smallest possible value of \\(r\\) is 65. For \\(r = 65\\), we have:\n\\[\na_i b_i = \\frac{2 \\cdot 65^2}{2 \\cdot 65 - 1} = \\frac{8450}{129} = 65.\n\\]\nThe possible pairs \\((a_i, b_i)\\) are the factor pairs of 65, which are \\((1, 65)\\), \\((5, 13)\\), \\((13, 5)\\), and \\((65, 1)\\). The corresponding values of \\(c_i\\) are:\n\\[\nc_1 = \\sqrt{1^2 + 65^2} = \\sqrt{4226}, \\quad c_2 = \\sqrt{5^2 + 13^2} = \\sqrt{194}, \\quad c_3 = \\sqrt{13^2 + 5^2} = \\sqrt{194}, \\quad c_4 = \\sqrt{65^2 + 1^2} = \\sqrt{4226}.\n\\]\nThe smallest 14 values of \\(c_i\\) are \\(\\sqrt{194}\\) and \\(\\sqrt{4226}\\). Therefore, the ratio \\(\\frac{c_{14}}{c_1}\\) is:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\sqrt{4226}}{\\sqrt{194}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{4226}{194}} = \\sqrt{21.8} \\approx 4.67.\n\\]\nHowever, we need the exact ratio, which is:\n\\[\n\\frac{c_{14}}{c_1} = \\frac{\\sqrt{4226}}{\\sqrt{194}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{4226}{194}} = \\sqrt{21.8} = \\sqrt{21.8} = \\sqrt{21.8} = \\sqrt{21.8} = \\sqrt{21.8} = \\sqrt{21.8}.\n\\]\nThe exact ratio is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{17}.\n\\]"

            "To solve for the positive integer \\( n \\) given the conditions, we start by analyzing the least common multiple (LCM) and greatest common divisor (GCD) conditions.\n\nFirst, we know that the LCM of \\( n \\) and 18 is 180. The prime factorizations are:\n\\[ 18 = 2 \\cdot 3^2 \\]\n\\[ 180 = 2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5 \\]\nThe LCM of two numbers is the product of the highest powers of all prime factors present in either number. Therefore, \\( n \\) must include the factor \\( 2^2 \\) (since 18 only has \\( 2^1 \\) and the LCM has \\( 2^2 \\)), the factor \\( 5 \\) (since 18 does not have 5 and the LCM does), and can include at most \\( 3^2 \\) (since 18 already has \\( 3^2 \\)). So, we can write:\n\\[ n = 2^2 \\cdot 3^a \\cdot 5 \\cdot k \\]\nwhere \\( a \\leq 2 \\) and \\( k \\) is an integer that does not introduce any new prime factors other than 2, 3, or 5. This simplifies to:\n\\[ n = 180 \\cdot k \\]\nwhere \\( k \\) is a factor that does not introduce any new prime factors other than 2, 3, or 5.\n\nNext, we use the GCD condition. The GCD of \\( n \\) and 45 is 15. The prime factorizations are:\n\\[ 45 = 3^2 \\cdot 5 \\]\n\\[ 15 = 3 \\cdot 5 \\]\nThe GCD of two numbers is the product of the lowest powers of all prime factors present in both numbers. Therefore, \\( n \\) must include the factor \\( 3 \\) and \\( 5 \\), but not \\( 2 \\) (since the GCD does not include 2). So, we can write:\n\\[ n = 3^b \\cdot 5 \\cdot m \\]\nwhere \\( b \\geq 1 \\) and \\( m \\) is an integer that does not introduce any new prime factors other than 2, 3, or 5. This simplifies to:\n\\[ n = 15 \\cdot m \\]\nwhere \\( m \\) is a factor that does not introduce any new prime factors other than 2, 3, or 5.\n\nCombining the two conditions, we see that \\( n \\) must be of the form \\( 180 \\cdot k \\) and also of the form \\( 15 \\cdot m \\). The only common form that satisfies both is \\( n = 180 \\) (since \\( k = 1 \\) and \\( m = 1 \\) are the simplest forms that do not introduce new prime factors). We need to check if this \\( n \\) satisfies the GCD condition:\n\\[ \\text{GCD}(180, 45) = 45 \\div 3 = 15 \\]\nThis is correct. Therefore, \\( n = 60 \\) is the correct value.\n\nFinally, we find the sum of the digits of \\( n \\):\n\\[ n = 60 \\]\nThe sum of the digits of 60 is:\n\\[ 6 + 0 = 6 \\]\nThus, the sum of the digits of \\( n \\) is \\(\\boxed{6}\\)."

The numbers that are not greater than 4 are 1, 2, 3, and 4. So, the probability that a single die shows a number that is not greater than 4 is \\( \\frac{4}{6} = \\frac{2}{3} \\).

            "To determine the area of the region inside both the square and the rectangle, we start by visualizing the given shapes. The rectangle has side lengths 4 and 8, and the square has a side length of 5. The square is positioned such that three of its vertices lie on three different sides of the rectangle.\n\nLet's place the rectangle in the coordinate plane with vertices at \\((0,0)\\), \\((8,0)\\), \\((8,4)\\), and \\((0,4)\\). Assume the square is positioned such that one of its vertices is at \\((x,0)\\) on the bottom side of the rectangle, another vertex is at \\((8,y)\\) on the right side of the rectangle, and the third vertex is at \\((8-x,4)\\) on the top side of the rectangle.\n\nSince the side length of the square is 5, the distance between \\((x,0)\\) and \\((8,y)\\) is 5. Similarly, the distance between \\((8,y)\\) and \\((8-x,4)\\) is 5. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the coordinates of the vertices of the square.\n\nFirst, the distance between \\((x,0)\\) and \\((8,y)\\) is:\n\\[\n\\sqrt{(8-x)^2 + y^2} = 5\n\\]\nSquaring both sides, we get:\n\\[\n(8-x)^2 + y^2 = 25\n\\]\n\nNext, the distance between \\((8,y)\\) and \\((8-x,4)\\) is:\n\\[\n\\sqrt{(8-x-8)^2 + (4-y)^2} = 5\n\\]\nSimplifying, we get:\n\\[\nx^2 + (4-y)^2 = 25\n\\]\n\nWe now have two equations:\n1. \\((8-x)^2 + y^2 = 25\\)\n2. \\(x^2 + (4-y)^2 = 25\\)\n\nExpanding both equations, we get:\n1. \\(64 - 16x + x^2 + y^2 = 25\\)\n2. \\(x^2 + 16 - 8y + y^2 = 25\\)\n\nSimplifying these, we get:\n1. \\(x^2 + y^2 - 16x = -39\\)\n2. \\(x^2 + y^2 - 8y = 9\\)\n\nSubtracting the second equation from the first, we get:\n\\[\n-16x + 8y = -48\n\\]\nSimplifying, we get:\n\\[\n-2x + y = -6 \\implies y = 2x - 6\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\(y = 2x - 6\\) into the second equation \\(x^2 + y^2 - 8y = 9\\), we get:\n\\[\nx^2 + (2x-6)^2 - 8(2x-6) = 9\n\\]\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n\\[\nx^2 + 4x^2 - 24x + 36 - 16x + 48 = 9\n\\]\n\\[\n5x^2 - 40x + 84 = 9\n\\]\n\\[\n5x^2 - 40x + 75 = 0\n\\]\nDividing by 5, we get:\n\\[\nx^2 - 8x + 15 = 0\n\\]\nFactoring, we get:\n\\[\n(x-3)(x-5) = 0\n\\]\nSo, \\(x = 3\\) or \\(x = 5\\).\n\nIf \\(x = 3\\), then \\(y = 2(3) - 6 = 0\\). This would place the square's vertices at \\((3,0)\\), \\((8,0)\\), \\((8,3)\\), and \\((3,4)\\), which is not possible since the side length of the square is 5.\n\nIf \\(x = 5\\), then \\(y = 2(5) - 6 = 4\\). This would place the square's vertices at \\((5,0)\\), \\((8,0)\\), \\((3,4)\\), and \\((5,4)\\), which is possible.\n\nSo, the vertices of the square are \\((5,0)\\), \\((8,0)\\), \\((8,4)\\), and \\((5,4)\\). The area of the region inside both the square and the rectangle is the area of the square minus the areas of the two right triangles outside the rectangle. The area of the square is \\(25\\), and the area of each right triangle is \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\times 3 \\times 4 = 6\\). So, the total area of the two triangles is \\(2 \\times 6 = 12\\).\n\nTherefore, the area of the region inside both the square and the rectangle is \\(25 - 12 = 13\\).

The center square has eight neighbors, but since the border is empty, the only possible filled neighbors are the four squares at positions (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,2), (3,4), (4,2), (4,3), and (4,4). However, since the border is empty, the only possible filled neighbors are the four squares at positions (2,2), (2,3), (3,2), and (3,4).\n\nWe need to count the number of ways to fill these four positions such that exactly three of them are filled. This is a combinatorial problem where we need to choose 3 out of 4 positions to be filled. The number of ways to do this is given by the binomial coefficient:\n\\[\n\\binom{4}{3} = 4\n\\]\nTherefore, there are 4 initial configurations that will lead to a transformed grid consisting of a single filled square in the center after a single transformation.\n\nThe answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{64}\n\\]"

            "To solve for the value of the sum \\(x_{2019} + 2x_{2020} + 4x_{2021} + 8x_{2022}\\), we start by analyzing the given condition \\(7S_n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2^n}\\) for all \\(n \\geq 1\\). Here, \\(S_n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} x_k 2^k\\) is the sum of the first \\(n\\) terms of the sequence \\(x_k\\) weighted by powers of 2.\n\nFirst, let's express \\(S_n\\) in a more convenient form. We know that \\(S_n\\) is the binary representation of the number formed by the first \\(n\\) terms of the sequence \\(x_k\\). Therefore, \\(S_n\\) is the integer whose binary representation is \\(x_{n-1}x_{n-2}\\ldots x_1x_0\\).\n\nGiven the condition \\(7S_n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2^n}\\), we need to find the value of \\(S_n\\) that satisfies this congruence. This means that \\(S_n\\) is the modular inverse of 7 modulo \\(2^n\\). The modular inverse of 7 modulo \\(2^n\\) is a number \\(y\\) such that \\(7y \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2^n}\\).\n\nTo find the modular inverse of 7 modulo \\(2^n\\), we can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm. However, for our purposes, we only need to know that such an inverse exists and is unique modulo \\(2^n\\). Let's denote this inverse by \\(y_n\\). Therefore, we have \\(S_n \\equiv y_n \\pmod{2^n}\\).\n\nNow, we need to determine the values of \\(x_{2019}\\), \\(x_{2020}\\), \\(x_{2021}\\), and \\(x_{2022}\\). To do this, we need to understand the pattern of the sequence \\(x_k\\). Since \\(S_n\\) is the sum of the first \\(n\\) terms of the sequence weighted by powers of 2, and \\(S_n \\equiv y_n \\pmod{2^n}\\), we can infer that the sequence \\(x_k\\) must be such that the sum \\(S_n\\) satisfies the given congruence for all \\(n \\geq 1\\).\n\nBy examining the congruence \\(7S_n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2^n}\\), we can deduce that the sequence \\(x_k\\) must be a specific sequence that satisfies this condition. One such sequence is the sequence where \\(x_k = 1\\) if \\(k\\) is a power of 2, and \\(x_k = 0\\) otherwise. This is because the sum \\(S_n\\) in this case is the sum of the powers of 2 up to \\(2^{n-1}\\), which is \\(2^n - 1\\). Therefore, \\(S_n = 2^n - 1\\), and \\(7S_n = 7(2^n - 1) \\equiv -7 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2^n}\\), which satisfies the given condition.\n\nThus, the sequence \\(x_k\\) is \\(x_k = 1\\) if \\(k\\) is a power of 2, and \\(x_k = 0\\) otherwise. Therefore, we have:\n\\[x_{2019} = 0, \\quad x_{2020} = 0, \\quad x_{2021} = 0, \\quad x_{2022} = 0.\\]\n\nSo, the value of the sum \\(x_{2019} + 2x_{2020} + 4x_{2021} + 8x_{2022}\\) is:\n\\[0 + 2 \\cdot 0 + 4 \\cdot 0 + 8 \\cdot 0 = 0.\\]\n\nThus, the answer is \\(\\boxed{0}\\)."

            "To find the area of the resulting 12-sided outer nonconvex polygon, we need to break down the problem into manageable parts. The polygon consists of a square with side length 1 and four regular hexagons surrounding it.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the area of the square:\n\\[\n\\text{Area of the square} = 1 \\times 1 = 1\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find the area of one regular hexagon. The side length of each hexagon is equal to the side length of the square, which is 1.

Each hexagon overlaps with the square by a trapezoid. The area of the trapezoid can be found by subtracting the area of the triangle that is not part of the trapezoid from the area of the equilateral triangle formed by two sides of the hexagon and the line connecting the two vertices of the hexagon that are not part of the square.\n\nThe area of one equilateral triangle with side length 1 is:\n\\[\n\\text{Area of one equilateral triangle} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} \\times 1^2 = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}\n\\]\nSince each hexagon is composed of 6 such triangles, the area of one hexagon is:\n\\[\n\\text{Area of one hexagon} = 6 \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} = \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2}\n\\]\nThe trapezoid is formed by removing two such triangles from the hexagon, so the area of the trapezoid is:\n\\[\n\\text{Area of the trapezoid} = \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2} - 2 \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} = \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2} - \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} = \\sqrt{3}\n\\]\nSince there are four hexagons, the total area of the trapezoids is:\n\\[\n4 \\times \\sqrt{3} = 4\\sqrt{3}\n\\]\nTherefore, the area of the 12-sided outer nonconvex polygon is the area of the square plus the area of the four hexagons minus the area of the four trapezoids:\n\\[\n1 + 6\\sqrt{3} - 4\\sqrt{3} = 1 + 2\\sqrt{3}\n\\]\nSo, the area of the resulting polygon is \\(1 + 2\\sqrt{3}\\).

Let's denote the first integer in a set by \\( n \\). The set is then \\(\\{n, n+1, n+2, \\ldots, n+9\\}\\).\n\nFor this set to contain exactly two multiples of 7, the multiples of 7 within the set must be \\( n \\) and \\( n+7 \\) (or \\( n-7 \\) if \\( n \\) is negative, but since we are dealing with positive integers, this is not a concern here). This means that \\( n \\) must be of the form \\( 7k \\) for some integer \\( k \\), but not \\( 7(k+1) \\) or \\( 7(k-1) \\) (since that would mean the set has fewer or more than two multiples of 7).\n\nSo, \\( n \\) must be of the form \\( 7k \\) where \\( k \\) is an integer such that \\( n \\) and \\( n+7 \\) are within the range of the set. This means \\( n \\) must be in the range \\( 1 \\leq n \\leq 933 \\) (since the last set ends at 1000, and the first integer of the last set is 991).\n\nNow, we need to count how many such \\( n \\) there are. The smallest \\( n \\) is 7 and the largest \\( n \\) is 994 (since 994 is the largest multiple of 7 that is less than or equal to 993). The sequence of these \\( n \\) is an arithmetic sequence with the first term 7 and the common difference 7. The number of terms in this sequence is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{994 - 7}{7} + 1 = \\frac{987}{7} + 1 = 141 + 1 = 142\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 142 sets that contain exactly two multiples of 7. Therefore, the number of sets that contain exactly two multiples of 7 is \\(\\boxed{42}\\)."

The conjugate of \\( z \\) is given by \\( \\overline{z} = re^{-i\\theta} \\). Substituting these into the equation, we get:\n\n\\[\n(re^{i\\theta})^5 = re^{-i\\theta}\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\nr^5 e^{i5\\theta} = re^{-i\\theta}\n\\]\n\nFor this equation to hold, the magnitudes on both sides must be equal, and the arguments must differ by an integer multiple of \\( 2\\pi \\). Therefore, we have two conditions:\n\n1. \\( r^5 = r \\)\n2. \\( 5\\theta = -\\theta + 2k\\pi \\) for some integer \\( k \\)\n\nFirst, we solve the magnitude equation \\( r^5 = r \\). This equation can be rewritten as:\n\n\\[\nr^5 - r = 0 \\implies r(r^4 - 1) = 0 \\implies r(r^2 - 1)(r^2 + 1) = 0 \\implies r(r-1)(r+1)(r^2+1) = 0\n\\]\n\nThe solutions to this equation are \\( r = 0 \\), \\( r = 1 \\), \\( r = -1 \\), and \\( r^2 = -1 \\). Since \\( r \\) is a non-negative real number, we discard \\( r = -1 \\) and \\( r^2 = -1 \\), leaving us with \\( r = 0 \\) and \\( r = 1 \\).\n\nNext, we solve the argument equation \\( 5\\theta = -\\theta + 2k\\pi \\). This simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n6\\theta = 2k\\pi \\implies \\theta = \\frac{k\\pi}{3}\n\\]\n\nThe value of \\( \\theta \\) must be taken modulo \\( 2\\pi \\), so \\( \\theta \\) can take any of the values \\( \\frac{k\\pi}{3} \\) for \\( k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 \\). This gives us 6 distinct values for \\( \\theta \\) in the interval \\( [0, 2\\pi) \\).\n\nNow, we consider the two cases for \\( r \\):\n\n1. If \\( r = 0 \\), then \\( z = 0 \\).

Then for \\(n=k+1\\), the sum \\(S_{k+1}\\) is the sum of the first and last elements (both 1) plus the sum of the elements in the \\(k\\)-th row, each increased by 1. This gives:\n  \\[\n  S_{k+1} = 1 + S_k + 1 = 2 + S_k = 2 + 3^{k-1} = 3^{k-1} + 3^{k-1} + 3^{k-1} = 3^k\n  \\]\nThus, by induction, \\(S_n = 3^{n-1}\\).\n\nNow, we need to find the units digit of \\(S_{2023} = 3^{2022}\\). To do this, we observe the pattern in the units digits of the powers of 3:\n- \\(3^1 = 3\\) (units digit is 3)\n- \\(3^2 = 9\\) (units digit is 9)\n- \\(3^3 = 27\\) (units digit is 7)\n- \\(3^4 = 81\\) (units digit is 1)\n- \\(3^5 = 243\\) (units digit is 3)\n- \\(3^6 = 729\\) (units digit is 9)\n- \\(3^7 = 2187\\) (units digit is 7)\n- \\(3^8 = 6561\\) (units digit is 1)\n\nWe see that the units digits repeat every 4 numbers: 3, 9, 7, 1. Therefore, to find the units digit of \\(3^{2022}\\), we need to determine the position of 2022 in the repeating cycle. We do this by finding the remainder when 2022 is divided by 4:\n\\[\n2022 \\div 4 = 505 \\text{ remainder } 2\n\\]\nSo, the units digit of \\(3^{2022}\\) is the same as the units digit of \\(3^2\\), which is 9.\n\nThus, the units digit of the sum of the 2023 numbers in the 2023rd row is \\(\\boxed{9}\\)."

            "To solve the problem, we need to understand the structure of a regular icosahedron and the distances between its vertices. A regular icosahedron has 12 vertices, 30 edges, and 20 faces, each of which is an equilateral triangle. The distance \\(d(A, B)\\) between two vertices \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) is the number of edges in the shortest path connecting them.\n\nThe possible values for \\(d(A, B)\\) are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Specifically:\n- \\(d(A, B) = 1\\) if \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are adjacent vertices (connected by an edge).\n- \\(d(A, B) = 2\\) if \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are vertices that are connected by a path of two edges.\n- \\(d(A, B) = 3\\) if \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are vertices that are connected by a path of three edges.\n- \\(d(A, B) = 4\\) if \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are vertices that are connected by a path of four edges.\n- \\(d(A, B) = 5\\) if \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are vertices that are connected by a path of five edges.\n\nIn a regular icosahedron, the vertices can be categorized into three groups based on their distance from a given vertex:\n- 5 vertices at distance 1 (adjacent vertices).\n- 5 vertices at distance 2.\n- 2 vertices at distance 3.\n- 1 vertex at distance 4.\n- 1 vertex at distance 5 (the vertex itself).\n\nWe need to find the probability that \\(d(Q, R) > d(R, S)\\). To do this, we will consider the possible values of \\(d(Q, R)\\) and \\(d(R, S)\\) and count the number of favorable outcomes.\n\nFirst, we note that the total number of ways to choose three distinct vertices \\(Q, R, S\\) from 12 vertices is \\(\\binom{12}{3} \\cdot 3! = 220 \\cdot 6 = 1320\\).\n\nNext, we need to count the number of favorable outcomes where \\(d(Q, R) > d(R, S)\\). We will consider the possible values of \\(d(Q, R)\\) and \\(d(R, S)\\):\n\n1. If \\(d(Q, R) = 5\\), then \\(d(R, S)\\) can be 4, 3, 2, or 1. There are 12 choices for \\(Q\\), 11 choices for \\(R\\) (since \\(R\\) must be at distance 1 from \\(Q\\)), and for each \\(R\\), the number of choices for \\(S\\) depends on the value of \\(d(R, S)\\). However, since the structure of the icosahedron is symmetric, we can use the fact that for each \\(Q\\) and \\(R\\), the number of \\(S\\) such that \\(d(R, S) < d(Q, R)\\) is the same as the number of \\(S\\) such that \\(d(Q, R) > d(R, S)\\). Therefore, exactly half of the remaining choices for \\(S\\) will satisfy \\(d(Q, R) > d(R, S)\\).\n\n2. If \\(d(Q, R) = 4\\), then \\(d(R, S)\\) can be 3, 2, or 1. Similarly, we can count the number of favorable outcomes.\n\n3. If \\(d(Q, R) = 3\\), then \\(d(R, S)\\) can be 2 or 1. Again, we can count the number of favorable outcomes.\n\n4. If \\(d(Q, R) = 2\\), then \\(d(R, S)\\) can be 1. We can count the number of favorable outcomes.\n\nBy symmetry and the structure of the icosahedron, we can conclude that the number of favorable outcomes is exactly half of the total number of outcomes. Therefore, the probability is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\nThus, the probability that \\(d(Q, R) > d(R, S)\\) is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\), and the final answer is \\(1 + 2 = \\boxed{3}\\)."

            "To determine the probability that Janet's running total equals 3 at some point during her four rolls of a standard 6-sided die, we need to consider all possible sequences of rolls and identify those sequences where the running total reaches 3.\n\nFirst, let's list the possible sequences of rolls that result in a running total of 3. The running total can be 3 if the last roll is a 3, or if the running total before the last roll is 1 or 2 and the last roll is 2 or 1, respectively. We will consider each case separately:\n\n1. **Case 1: The last roll is 3.**\n   - The first three rolls can be any combination of numbers that sum to 0, 1, or 2. However, since the minimum value of a die roll is 1, the only valid sequence here is if the first three rolls are all 1's, which is not possible since the sum of three 1's is 3, not 0, 1, or 2. Therefore, there are no valid sequences in this case.\n\n2. **Case 2: The last roll is 2.**\n   - The first three rolls must sum to 1. The only way to get a sum of 1 with three die rolls is if the first two rolls are 1 and 0, but since the minimum value is 1, this is not possible. Therefore, there are no valid sequences in this case either.\n\n3. **Case 3: The last roll is 1.**\n   - The first three rolls must sum to 2. The only way to get a sum of 2 with three die rolls is if the first two rolls are 1 and 1. Therefore, the valid sequences are:\n     - 1, 1, 1, 1\n     - 1, 1, 2, 1\n     - 1, 2, 1, 1\n     - 2, 1, 1, 1\n\nNow, we need to count the total number of possible sequences of four die rolls. Since each roll is independent and there are 6 possible outcomes for each roll, the total number of sequences is \\(6^4 = 1296\\).\n\nNext, we count the number of favorable sequences. From the cases above, we see that there are 4 sequences that result in a running total of 3 at some point during the four rolls.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the running total equals 3 at some point is:\n\\[\n\\frac{4}{1296} = \\frac{1}{324}\n\\]\n\nThe fraction \\(\\frac{1}{324}\\) is already in its simplest form, so \\(m = 1\\) and \\(n = 324\\).

The month M can range from 01 to 12, and the day D can range from 01 to 31. We need to ensure that each digit in the 8-digit number YMMDD appears an even number of times.\n\nFirst, let's list the digits we have: 2, 0, 2, 3. This gives us the digits 0, 2, and 3, each appearing at least once. For each digit to appear an even number of times, the digits M and D must contribute the necessary even counts of the digits 0, 2, and 3.\n\nLet's analyze the possible values for M and D:\n- The digit 0 can appear in the month or the day.\n- The digit 2 can appear in the month or the day.\n- The digit 3 can appear in the day.\n\nWe need to count the valid combinations of M and D such that the total count of each digit (0, 2, and 3) is even. This means that if a digit appears once in the year, it must appear an odd number of times in M and D, and if it appears twice in the year, it must appear an even number of times in M and D.\n\nLet's break it down:\n1. If the digit 0 appears in M, it must appear an odd number of times in D. The possible values for M are 01, 02, 03, 04, 05, 06, 07, 08, 09, 10. For each of these, D can be any day that does not include the digit 0. This gives us 9 possible months and 30 or 31 possible days, depending on the month.\n2.

For each of these, D can be any day that does not include the digit 2. This gives us 10 possible months and 30 or 31 possible days, depending on the month.\n3. If the digit 3 appears in D, it must appear an even number of times in M and D. The possible values for D are 03, 13, 23. For each of these, M can be any month that does not include the digit 3. This gives us 11 possible months and 1 possible day.\n\nNow, we need to count the valid combinations:\n- For the digit 0, it can appear in M in 9 ways, and for each of these, D can be any day that does not include the digit 0. This gives us 9 * 30 = 270 ways.\n- For the digit 2, it can appear in M in 10 ways, and for each of these, D can be any day that does not include the digit 2. This gives us 10 * 30 = 300 ways.\n- For the digit 3, it can appear in D in 3 ways, and for each of these, M can be any month that does not include the digit 3. This gives us 11 * 3 = 33 ways.\n\nAdding these together, we get 270 + 300 + 33 = 603.\n\nTherefore, the number of dates in 2023 for which each digit appears an even number of times in the 8-digit display is \\(\\boxed{0}\\)."

            "To determine the value of \\( x \\) in Coinland, we need to find the largest amount of money that cannot be formed using the coin values of 6, 10, and 15 cents. This problem is a variation of the Frobenius coin problem, which deals with finding the largest number that cannot be expressed as a non-negative integer combination of given coin values.\n\nFirst, we note that the coin values are 6, 10, and 15. We will use the fact that for two coprime integers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), the largest number that cannot be expressed as a non-negative integer combination of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) is given by \\( ab - a - b \\). However, since we have three coin values, we need to approach this problem differently.\n\nWe will use the fact that any number that can be formed using 6, 10, and 15 can be formed using just 6 and 10, because any number that can be formed using 15 can also be formed using 6 and 10 by subtracting multiples of 15 and adding multiples of 6 and 10. Therefore, we only need to consider the coin values 6 and 10.\n\nThe largest number that cannot be formed using 6 and 10 is given by the Frobenius number for 6 and 10. Since 6 and 10 are not coprime (they share a common factor of 2), we need to find the largest odd number that cannot be formed. We can check the numbers step by step:\n\n- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 25, ...\n\nWe see that 17 is the largest number that cannot be formed using 6 and 10. Now, we need to check if adding the 15 cent coin allows us to form 17. Since 17 is not a multiple of 15, we need to check if we can form 17 using 6, 10, and 15. We can check:\n\n- 17 - 15 = 2 (not possible with 6 and 10)\n- 17 - 10 = 7 (not possible with 6 and 15)\n- 17 - 6 = 11 (not possible with 10 and 15)\n- 17 - 1 = 16 (not possible with 6 and 10)\n- 17 - 2 = 15 (possible with 15)\n- 17 - 3 = 14 (not possible with 6 and 10)\n- 17 - 4 = 13 (not possible with 6 and 10)\n- 17 - 5 = 12 (not possible with 6 and 10)\n- 17 - 7 = 10 (possible with 10)\n- 17 - 8 = 9 (not possible with 6 and 10)\n- 17 - 11 = 6 (possible with 6)\n- 17 - 13 = 4 (not possible with 6 and 10)\n- 17 - 17 = 0 (possible with 6 and 10)\n\nSince 17 cannot be formed using 6, 10, and 15, the largest number that cannot be formed is 43. We can verify this by checking that 43 cannot be formed using 6, 10, and 15, but any number greater than 43 can be formed.\n\nTherefore, the value of \\( x \\) is 43, and the sum of the digits of 43 is \\( 4 + 3 = 7 \\).\n\nThe answer is \\(\\boxed{7}\\)."

Since the triangle has an angle of \\(120^\\circ\\), we can use the Law of Cosines to find \\(d\\).\n\nAssume the angle of \\(120^\\circ\\) is opposite the side of length \\(6+2d\\).

Since \\(d\\) must be positive, we have \\(d = 4\\). Therefore, the side lengths of the triangle are 6, 10, and 14.\n\nNext, we use the formula for the area of a triangle given two sides and the included angle. The area \\(K\\) of triangle \\(ABC\\) is given by:\n\\[\nK = \\frac{1}{2}ab \\sin C\n\\]\nHere, \\(a = 6\\), \\(b = 10\\), and \\(C = 120^\\circ\\).

The rectangle can be placed either horizontally or vertically. If placed horizontally, it can cover any of the following pairs of squares: (1,2), (2,3), (4,5), (5,6), (7,8), (8,9). If placed vertically, it can cover any of the following pairs of squares: (1,4), (2,5), (3,6), (4,7), (5,8), (6,9).\n\nThere are 6 possible horizontal placements and 6 possible vertical placements, giving us a total of 12 possible placements for the rectangle.\n\nTo ensure that we cover at least one square of the rectangle, we need to guess squares in such a way that we eliminate the possibility of the rectangle not covering any of our guessed squares. One effective strategy is to guess the squares in a way that maximizes the number of placements the rectangle cannot avoid.\n\nConsider the following strategy: guess the squares in the positions (1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9). This guess covers all possible horizontal placements (1,2), (2,3), (4,5), (5,6), (7,8), (8,9) and part of the vertical placements (1,4), (2,5), (3,6), (4,7), (5,8), (6,9).

The remaining vertical placements (1,4), (4,7), (5,8), (6,9) are not necessarily covered by our guesses, but we can ensure that at least one of the horizontal placements is covered.\n\nLet's verify this:\n- If the rectangle is placed horizontally on (1,2), we guess (1,2,3) and it will be covered.\n- If the rectangle is placed horizontally on (2,3), we guess (1,2,3) and it will be covered.\n- If the rectangle is placed horizontally on (4,5), we guess (4,5,6) and it will be covered.\n- If the rectangle is placed horizontally on (5,6), we guess (4,5,6) and it will be covered.\n- If the rectangle is placed vertically on (1,4), we guess (1,2,3) and it will be covered.\n- If the rectangle is placed vertically on (2,5), we guess (2,5,6) and it will be covered.\n- If the rectangle is placed vertically on (3,6), we guess (3,6,8) and it will be covered.\n- If the rectangle is placed vertically on (4,7), it is not necessarily covered by our guesses, but we can ensure that at least one of the horizontal placements is covered.\n- If the rectangle is placed vertically on (5,8), it is not necessarily covered by our guesses, but we can ensure that at least one of the horizontal placements is covered.\n- If the rectangle is placed vertically on (6,9), it is not necessarily covered by our guesses, but we can ensure that at least one of the horizontal placements is covered.\n\nTherefore, by guessing the squares in the positions (1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9), we can ensure that at least one of our guessed squares is covered by the rectangle.

            "To determine the area of the region defined by the inequality \\( | | x | - 1 | + | | y | - 1 | \\le 1 \\), we need to analyze the expression step by step.\n\nFirst, let's introduce new variables to simplify the expression. Let \\( u = |x| \\) and \\( v = |y| \\). The inequality then becomes:\n\\[ |u - 1| + |v - 1| \\le 1. \\]\n\nThis inequality describes a diamond (or square rotated by 45 degrees) centered at \\((1,1)\\) with side length \\(\\sqrt{2}\\). To see why, consider the different cases for the absolute values:\n\n1. If \\( u \\ge 1 \\) and \\( v \\ge 1 \\), then \\( |u-1| = u-1 \\) and \\( |v-1| = v-1 \\), so the inequality becomes \\( (u-1) + (v-1) \\le 1 \\) or \\( u + v \\le 3 \\).\n2. If \\( u \\ge 1 \\) and \\( v < 1 \\), then \\( |u-1| = u-1 \\) and \\( |v-1| = 1-v \\), so the inequality becomes \\( (u-1) + (1-v) \\le 1 \\) or \\( u - v \\le 1 \\).\n3. If \\( u < 1 \\) and \\( v \\ge 1 \\), then \\( |u-1| = 1-u \\) and \\( |v-1| = v-1 \\), so the inequality becomes \\( (1-u) + (v-1) \\le 1 \\) or \\( -u + v \\le 1 \\) or \\( v - u \\le 1 \\).\n4. If \\( u < 1 \\) and \\( v < 1 \\), then \\( |u-1| = 1-u \\) and \\( |v-1| = 1-v \\), so the inequality becomes \\( (1-u) + (1-v) \\le 1 \\) or \\( 2 - u - v \\le 1 \\) or \\( u + v \\ge 1 \\).\n\nThese four inequalities describe a diamond centered at \\((1,1)\\) with vertices at \\((2,1)\\), \\((1,2)\\), \\((0,1)\\), and \\((1,0)\\). The distance from the center to each vertex is \\(\\sqrt{2}\\), so the side length of the diamond is \\(\\sqrt{2}\\).\n\nThe area of a diamond (or square) is given by the product of its diagonals divided by 2. However, in this case, it is easier to recognize that the area of a diamond with side length \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) is simply the area of a square with side length \\(\\sqrt{2}\\), which is \\((\\sqrt{2})^2 = 2\\).\n\nSince the original variables \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) represent the absolute values of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) respectively, the region in the \\(xy\\)-plane is symmetric with respect to both the \\(x\\)-axis and the \\(y\\)-axis. Therefore, the area of the region defined by the original inequality is four times the area of the diamond in the first quadrant.\n\nThus, the area of the region is:\n\\[ 4 \\times 2 = 8. \\]\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{8}. \\]"
