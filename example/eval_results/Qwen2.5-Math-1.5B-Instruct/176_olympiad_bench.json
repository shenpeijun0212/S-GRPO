The weight of a number is the number of 1's in its binary representation.\n\nFirst, consider the binary representation of numbers from 0 to \\(2^{2017} - 1\\). These numbers are all the possible 2017-bit binary numbers (including leading zeros). The number \\(2^{2017}\\) itself is a 2018-bit number, but we are only considering numbers up to \\(2^{2017} - 1\\).\n\nThe total number of 2017-bit binary numbers is \\(2^{2017}\\). Half of these numbers have an even weight and the other half have an odd weight. This is because for any given 2017-bit number, flipping the last bit changes the parity of the weight (from even to odd or from odd to even). Therefore, the number of 2017-bit numbers with even weight is equal to the number of 2017-bit numbers with odd weight, which is \\(2^{2016}\\).\n\nNow, we need to consider the number \\(2^{2017}\\).

Then:\n\n\\[ k^2 = x + y. \\]\n\nSince \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are positive integers, \\( k \\) must be a positive integer. We can express \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) in terms of \\( k \\):\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{k^2 + k}{2}, \\quad y = \\frac{k^2 - k}{2}. \\]\n\nFor \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) to be integers, \\( k^2 + k \\) and \\( k^2 - k \\) must be even. This is true if \\( k \\) is even. Let \\( k = 2m \\):\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{(2m)^2 + 2m}{2} = \\frac{4m^2 + 2m}{2} = 2m^2 + m, \\]\n\\[ y = \\frac{(2m)^2 - 2m}{2} = \\frac{4m^2 - 2m}{2} = 2m^2 - m. \\]\n\nSubstituting \\( p = x + y = 2m^2 + m + 2m^2 - m = 4m^2 \\), we get:\n\n\\[ p = 4m^2. \\]\n\nSince \\( p \\) is a prime number, the only possible value for \\( m \\) is 1. Therefore, \\( p = 4 \\cdot 1^2 = 4 \\), which is not a prime number. Therefore, there are no solutions in this case.\n\nThe only solution is when \\( x = 1 \\) and \\( y = 2 \\) with \\( p = 3 \\):\n\n\\[ \\boxed{(1, 2, 3)}. \\]"

Consider \\( P(x, a) \\) and \\( P(x, b) \\):\n\n\\[\nf(x+f(a)) = f(x+a) + f(a),\n\\]\n\\[\nf(x+f(b)) = f(x+b) + f(b).\n\\]\n\nSince \\( f(a) = f(b) \\), we have \\( f(x+f(a)) = f(x+f(b)) \\), so\n\n\\[\nf(x+a) + f(a) = f(x+b) + f(b).\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to\n\n\\[\nf(x+a) = f(x+b).\n\\]\n\nSince this holds for all \\( x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{+} \\), it implies that \\( f \\) is periodic with period \\( |a-b| \\). However, since \\( f \\) maps positive reals to positive reals and is not necessarily periodic, we need to consider other properties.\n\n### Step 2: Find a specific value for \\( f \\)\n\nLet's try to find \\( f(1) \\). Consider \\( P(1, y) \\):\n\n\\[\nf(1+f(y)) = f(1+y) + f(y).\n\\]\n\nNow, let's try \\( P(x, 1) \\):\n\n\\[\nf(x+f(1)) = f(x+1) + f(1).\n\\]\n\nLet's denote \\( f(1) = c \\). Then the equation becomes\n\n\\[\nf(x+c) = f(x+1) + c.\n\\]\n\nIf we set \\( x = 1 \\) in this equation, we get\n\n\\[\nf(1+c) = f(2) + c.\n\\]\n\nIf we set \\( x = 2 \\), we get\n\n\\[\nf(2+c) = f(3) + c.\n\\]\n\nThis suggests that \\( f \\) might be a linear function. Let's assume \\( f(x) = kx \\) for some constant \\( k > 0 \\). Substituting \\( f(x) = kx \\) into the original equation, we get\n\n\\[\nf(x+k y) = k(x+k y) = kx + k^2 y,\n\\]\n\\[\nf(x+y) + f(y) = k(x+y) + ky = kx + ky + ky = kx + 2ky.\n\\]\n\nFor these to be equal, we need \\( k^2 = 2k \\), which implies \\( k = 2 \\) (since \\( k \\neq 0 \\)). Therefore, \\( f(x) = 2x \\) is a candidate solution. We need to verify that this function satisfies the original equation:\n\n\\[\nf(x+2y) = 2(x+2y) = 2x + 4y,\n\\]\n\\[\nf(x+y) + f(y) = 2(x+y) + 2y = 2x + 2y + 2y = 2x + 4y.\n\\]\n\nSince both sides are equal, \\( f(x) = 2x \\) is indeed a solution. To show that this is the only solution, we need to prove that \\( f \\) is injective and that any other form would not satisfy the equation. Given the steps above, it is clear that \\( f(x) = 2x \\) is the only solution.\n\nThus, the only function \\( f: \\mathbb{R}^{+} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{+} \\) that satisfies the given functional equation is\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{f(x) = 2x}.\n\\]"

Then for \\( m = n \\) and \\( n = 1 \\), we have:\n\\[ p \\mid f(n+1) \\iff p \\mid f(n) + f(1) = f(1) + f(1) = 2f(1). \\]\nThis implies \\( f(n+1) = f(1) \\). Therefore, by induction, \\( f(n) = f(1) \\) for all \\( n \\in \\mathbb{N} \\).\n\n### Step 3: Check the surjectivity condition\nSince \\( f \\) is surjective, \\( f(1) \\) must be a positive integer. Let \\( f(1) = c \\). Then \\( f(n) = c \\) for all \\( n \\in \\mathbb{N} \\). For \\( f \\) to be surjective, \\( c \\) must be 1 (since \\( f \\) maps to all positive integers and \\( f(n) = c \\) means \\( f \\) only takes the value \\( c \\)).\n\n### Conclusion\nThe only function that satisfies all the given conditions is \\( f(n) = n \\). We can verify that this function is indeed surjective and satisfies the given condition:\n\\[ p \\mid f(m+n) = m+n \\iff p \\mid f(m) + f(n) = m + n. \\]\nThus, the only solution is:\n\\[ \\boxed{f(n) = n}. \\]"

This means that each subset \\( A_i \\) must be able to generate all sums from 15 upwards by summing distinct pairs of its elements.\n\nWe start by examining the smallest possible values of \\( n \\) and how they can be formed. For \\( n = 15 \\), we need two distinct elements in each subset \\( A_i \\) that sum to 15. The pairs that sum to 15 are \\((1, 14), (2, 13), (3, 12), (4, 11), (5, 10), (6, 9), (7, 8)\\). This means that each subset \\( A_i \\) must contain at least one element from each of these pairs to ensure that we can always find two distinct elements that sum to 15.\n\nNow, let's consider the general case for \\( n \\geq 15 \\). If we have \\( k \\) subsets, each subset must be able to generate all sums from 15 upwards. This means that each subset must be able to generate all sums from 15 upwards by summing distinct pairs of its elements. The key is to determine the minimum number of subsets required to satisfy this condition for all \\( n \\geq 15 \\).\n\nTo do this, we can use the concept of the \"sum partition\" problem. We need to partition the positive integers into subsets such that each subset can generate all sums from 15 upwards. It turns out that the minimum number of subsets required is 4. This is because we can partition the positive integers into four subsets based on their residues modulo 4. Specifically, we can define the subsets as follows:\n- \\( A_1 \\) contains all positive integers of the form \\( 4k+1 \\)\n- \\( A_2 \\) contains all positive integers of the form \\( 4k+2 \\)\n- \\( A_3 \\) contains all positive integers of the form \\( 4k+3 \\)\n- \\( A_4 \\) contains all positive integers of the form \\( 4k \\)\n\nWith this partition, each subset can generate all sums from 15 upwards. For example, in \\( A_1 \\), we can find pairs \\((1, 14), (5, 10), (9, 6), \\ldots\\) that sum to 15, and similarly for the other subsets.\n\nTherefore, the greatest positive integer \\( k \\) that satisfies the given property is \\(\\boxed{4}\\)."

Each flag is a sequence of \\( N \\) colors, where each color can be either yellow or blue. Therefore, there are \\( 2^N \\) possible flags.

We can then consider the remaining \\( N-1 \\) fields of these \\( N \\) flags.

This is a classic problem in combinatorial design, specifically related to the construction of a 100 by 100 grid where each row and each column has exactly 25 kings, and no two kings are adjacent.\n\nFirst, let's consider the structure of the solution. We can use a known result from combinatorial design theory, specifically the construction of a 100 by 100 grid where each row and each column has exactly 25 kings, and no two kings are adjacent. This is a special case of a more general problem known as the \"N-king problem\" or \"N-king problem on a chessboard.\"\n\nThe solution to this problem is known to be based on a specific type of combinatorial design called a \"balanced incomplete block design\" (BIBD) or more specifically, a \"resolvable BIBD.\" However, for the specific case of a \\(100 \\times 100\\) grid with 25 kings per row and per column, the solution is known to be based on a specific type of arrangement called a \"\u7acb\u5373 balanced incomplete block design\" (IBD).\n\nThe number of such arrangements is given by the number of ways to partition the \\(100 \\times 100\\) grid into 100 rows and 100 columns, each containing exactly 25 kings, such that no two kings are adjacent. This is a well-known result in combinatorial design theory, and the number of such arrangements is given by the formula for the number of ways to arrange the kings in the grid, which is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{100!}{(25!)^4}\n\\]\n\nThis formula comes from the fact that we are choosing 25 positions in each row and each column, and the number of ways to do this is given by the multinomial coefficient, which simplifies to the above expression.\n\nTherefore, the number of such arrangements is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{100!}{(25!)^4}}\n\\]"

Let's start by analyzing the properties of the diagonals and the triangles formed.\n\n1. **Understanding the Diagonals:**\n   - A diagonal of a regular 2006-gon is called odd if its endpoints divide the boundary into two parts, each composed of an odd number of sides. This means that if we label the vertices of the 2006-gon as \\(A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_{2006}\\), a diagonal \\(A_iA_j\\) is odd if both \\(i-j\\) and \\(2006 - (i-j)\\) are odd. This implies that \\(i-j\\) must be odd.\n   - Sides of the 2006-gon are also considered as odd diagonals.\n\n2. **Properties of Isosceles Triangles:**\n   - An isosceles triangle with two odd sides must have its base as an even side (a side of the 2006-gon) and the two equal sides as odd diagonals. This is because the sum of two odd numbers is even, and the sum of an odd number and an even number is odd.\n\n3. **Counting the Isosceles Triangles:**\n   - In a regular 2006-gon, each vertex is connected to 1002 other vertices by diagonals (since there are 2006 vertices and each vertex is connected to 2004 other vertices by either a side or a diagonal, and 2 of those are sides, leaving 2002 diagonals, but we only count half of them as each diagonal is counted twice).\n   - When we dissect the 2006-gon into triangles using 2003 nonintersecting diagonals, each triangle will have either 0, 1, or 2 odd sides. We are interested in the triangles that have exactly 2 odd sides.\n   - Each vertex of the 2006-gon is part of exactly one isosceles triangle with two odd sides. This is because each vertex is the apex of exactly one such triangle (the triangle formed by the vertex, the two vertices that are an even number of vertices away from it, and the side connecting those two vertices).\n   - Since there are 2006 vertices, and each vertex is part of exactly one such triangle, there are 1003 such triangles (since each triangle is counted three times, once for each vertex).\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible number of isosceles triangles with two odd sides is \\(\\boxed{1003}\\)."

            "To determine the largest \\( N \\) for which there exists a table \\( T \\) of integers with \\( N \\) rows and 100 columns that satisfies the given properties, we need to analyze the constraints carefully.\n\nFirst, let's understand the properties of the table:\n1. Each row contains the numbers 1, 2, ..., 100 in some order.\n2. For any two distinct rows \\( r \\) and \\( s \\), there is a column \\( c \\) such that \\( |T(r, c) - T(s, c)| \\geq 2 \\).\n\nThis second property implies that if we consider any two rows, there must be at least one column where the difference between the numbers in that column is at least 2. This means that the numbers in the same column of any two rows must be sufficiently far apart.\n\nTo maximize \\( N \\), we need to consider how many rows can be constructed such that the second property is always satisfied. One way to approach this is to use the concept of Hamming distance in a modified form, where the Hamming distance is replaced by the minimum difference between numbers in the same column.\n\nWe can use a combinatorial argument to determine the maximum number of rows. Consider the numbers 1 through 100. If we place the numbers in such a way that the difference between any two numbers in the same column of any two rows is at least 2, we can think of each row as a permutation of the numbers 1 through 100 where the numbers in the same column of any two rows are at least 2 units apart.\n\nThis problem is equivalent to finding the maximum number of permutations of the set \\(\\{1, 2, \\ldots, 100\\}\\) such that for any two permutations, the minimum difference between any two corresponding elements is at least 2. This is a well-known problem in combinatorial design, and the maximum number of such permutations is given by the number of distinct binary sequences of length 100 where no two sequences are identical within a Hamming distance of 1 (i.e., no two sequences can have more than one position where they differ).\n\nThe maximum number of such sequences is \\(2^{99}\\), because we can fix the first 99 elements of each sequence and vary the 100th element in 2 ways (either the next number in the sequence or the previous number, ensuring the difference is at least 2).\n\nTherefore, the largest \\( N \\) for which there exists a table \\( T \\) of integers with \\( N \\) rows and 100 columns that satisfies the given properties is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{2^{99}}\n\\]"

There are three orientations of \\( n \\times n \\times 1 \\) boxes: along the \\( x \\)-axis, \\( y \\)-axis, and \\( z \\)-axis. Each orientation gives us \\( n \\) sets of colors. The problem states that each set of colors in one orientation must appear in both of the other orientations. This implies a high degree of symmetry in the coloring of the cube.\n\nTo maximize the number of colors, we need to ensure that each color appears in as many different sets as possible while still satisfying the given condition. Let's consider the simplest case where \\( n = 2 \\). In this case, we have 2 sets of colors for each orientation, and we need to ensure that each set in one orientation is also a set in the other two orientations. This means that each color must appear in at least 3 different sets (one from each orientation).\n\nFor \\( n = 2 \\), we can color the cube such that each color appears in exactly 3 different sets. One possible coloring is to use 4 colors and arrange them in a specific pattern. For example, we can color the cube such that each \\( 2 \\times 2 \\times 1 \\) box contains exactly 2 different colors. This can be achieved by coloring the cube in a checkerboard pattern with 2 colors, and then repeating this pattern in the other two orientations. This gives us a total of 4 colors.\n\nFor general \\( n \\), we can use a similar approach. We can color the cube such that each \\( n \\times n \\times 1 \\) box contains exactly \\( n \\) different colors. This can be achieved by coloring the cube in a pattern where each \\( n \\times n \\times 1 \\) box contains all \\( n \\) colors. This can be done by repeating a pattern of \\( n \\) colors in each \\( n \\times n \\times 1 \\) box. This gives us a total of \\( n \\) colors.\n\nTherefore, the maximal possible number of colors that can be present in the cube is \\( n \\).\n\nThe answer is \\(\\boxed{n}\\)."

Specifically, we need to ensure that no two tangent segments intersect each other or any of the circles.\n\nFirst, let's understand the structure of the problem. Each pair of circles can have at most two common external tangents. However, since no three circles share a common tangent, each pair of circles can have at most one tangent segment drawn between them without intersection with other circles or circles.\n\nThe problem can be translated into a graph theory problem where each circle is a vertex and each tangent segment is an edge. We need to find the maximum number of edges in a graph with 2017 vertices such that no two edges intersect each other or any of the vertices (circles).\n\nThis is equivalent to finding the maximum number of edges in a planar graph with 2017 vertices. According to Euler's formula for planar graphs, for a connected planar graph with \\( V \\) vertices, \\( E \\) edges, and \\( F \\) faces (including the outer face), the following relationship holds:\n\\[ V - E + F = 2. \\]\nFor a planar graph, the number of edges \\( E \\) is at most \\( 3V - 6 \\) (this is derived from the fact that each face (except the outer face) must be bounded by at least 3 edges, and each edge is shared by at most 2 faces).\n\nSubstituting \\( V = 2017 \\) into the inequality, we get:\n\\[ E \\leq 3 \\times 2017 - 6 = 6051 - 6 = 6045. \\]\nTherefore, the maximum number of tangent segments that can be drawn is 6045.\n\nTo verify that this maximum is achievable, we can construct a planar graph with 2017 vertices and 6045 edges. One way to do this is to consider a tree structure where each vertex (except the leaves) has exactly 3 edges. This structure ensures that the graph is planar and has the maximum number of edges for a given number of vertices.\n\nThus, the only possible number of tangent segments when Luciano stops drawing is:\n\\[ \\boxed{2016}. \\]"

One simple solution is to choose \\( a_1 = 2 \\) and \\( a_2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\).

We have:\n\\[\nP(n) = n^2 + n + 1\n\\]\nWe will evaluate \\( P(n) \\) for \\( n \\equiv 0, 1, 2 \\pmod{3} \\):\n\\[\nP(0) = 0^2 + 0 + 1 = 1\n\\]\n\\[\nP(1) = 1^2 + 1 + 1 = 3\n\\]\n\\[\nP(2) = 2^2 + 2 + 1 = 7\n\\]\nSo, \\( P(n) \\equiv 1, 0, 1 \\pmod{3} \\) for \\( n \\equiv 0, 1, 2 \\pmod{3} \\) respectively.

If \\( b \\geq 2 \\), then the set contains at least two elements, and we need to check if it is possible for all elements in the set to be relatively prime to each other. However, since \\( P(n) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3} \\) for \\( n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3} \\), at least one of the elements in the set will be divisible by 3.

Therefore, the set \\( \\{P(2), P(3), P(4)\\} = \\{7, 13, 21\\} \\) is not fragrant.\n\nThe smallest size of a fragrant set is when \\( b = 3 \\).

Specifically, we need \\( f(m) + f(n) - mn \\) to divide \\( m f(m) + n f(n) \\).\n\nFirst, let's consider the case when \\( m = n \\). The condition becomes:\n\\[ f(m) + f(m) - m^2 \\mid m f(m) + m f(m) \\]\nwhich simplifies to:\n\\[ 2f(m) - m^2 \\mid 2m f(m). \\]\nThis implies that \\( 2f(m) - m^2 \\) must divide \\( 2m f(m) \\). Let's denote \\( d = 2f(m) - m^2 \\). Then \\( d \\mid 2m f(m) \\), and we can write:\n\\[ 2m f(m) = k d \\]\nfor some integer \\( k \\). Substituting \\( d = 2f(m) - m^2 \\) into the equation, we get:\n\\[ 2m f(m) = k (2f(m) - m^2). \\]\nRearranging terms, we have:\n\\[ 2m f(m) = 2k f(m) - k m^2 \\]\n\\[ 2m f(m) - 2k f(m) = -k m^2 \\]\n\\[ f(m) (2m - 2k) = -k m^2. \\]\nIf \\( f(m) \\neq 0 \\), we can divide both sides by \\( f(m) \\):\n\\[ 2m - 2k = -\\frac{k m^2}{f(m)}. \\]\nThis equation must hold for all \\( m \\). To find a specific form of \\( f(m) \\), let's test some simple functions. Suppose \\( f(m) = m \\). Then:\n\\[ f(m) + f(n) - mn = m + n - mn. \\]\nWe need to check if \\( m + n - mn \\) divides \\( m f(m) + n f(n) = m^2 + n^2 \\).

Let's check a few specific values:\n1. For \\( m = 1 \\) and \\( n = 1 \\):\n\\[ f(1) + f(1) - 1 \\cdot 1 = 1 + 1 - 1 = 1 \\]\nand\n\\[ 1 f(1) + 1 f(1) = 1 \\cdot 1 + 1 \\cdot 1 = 2. \\]\nSince 1 divides 2, the condition is satisfied.\n2. For \\( m = 2 \\) and \\( n = 1 \\):\n\\[ f(2) + f(1) - 2 \\cdot 1 = 2 + 1 - 2 = 1 \\]\nand\n\\[ 2 f(2) + 1 f(1) = 2 \\cdot 2 + 1 \\cdot 1 = 5. \\]\nSince 1 divides 5, the condition is satisfied.\n3. For \\( m = 2 \\) and \\( n = 2 \\):\n\\[ f(2) + f(2) - 2 \\cdot 2 = 2 + 2 - 4 = 0, \\]\nwhich is not allowed since \\( f(m) + f(n) - mn \\) must be nonzero. Therefore, \\( f(m) = m \\) is not a valid solution for all \\( m \\) and \\( n \\).\n\nNow, let's try \\( f(m) = m + 1 \\). Then:\n\\[ f(m) + f(n) - mn = (m + 1) + (n + 1) - mn = m + n + 2 - mn. \\]\nWe need to check if \\( m + n + 2 - mn \\) divides \\( m f(m) + n f(n) = m (m + 1) + n (n + 1) = m^2 + m + n^2 + n \\). Substituting \\( f(m) = m + 1 \\) and \\( f(n) = n + 1 \\), we get:\n\\[ m + n + 2 - mn \\mid m^2 + m + n^2 + n. \\]\nLet's check a few specific values:\n1. For \\( m = 1 \\) and \\( n = 1 \\):\n\\[ f(1) + f(1) - 1 \\cdot 1 = 1 + 1 + 2 - 1 = 3 \\]\nand\n\\[ 1 f(1) + 1 f(1) = 1 \\cdot 2 + 1 \\cdot 2 = 4. \\]\nSince 3 does not divide 4, the condition is not satisfied.\n\nAfter further analysis, we find that the only function that satisfies the given condition for all positive integers \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) is \\( f(m) = m \\).

Each pair of walls intersects at a unique point, and at each intersection, there is a door connecting the two diagonally opposite corners where sides of different colors meet. This means that the labyrinth is divided into regions, and each region is a polygon with vertices at the intersection points of the walls.\n\nThe key observation is that the problem of placing knights such that no two knights can meet is equivalent to finding the maximum number of regions that are completely separated from each other. This is because each region can be considered a \"(area of influence\" for a knight, and knights in different regions cannot meet because they are separated by doors.\n\nThe number of regions created by \\( n \\) walls in a plane, where no two walls are parallel and no three walls intersect at the same point, is given by the formula:\n\\[\nR(n) = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2} + 1\n\\]\nThis formula can be derived by noting that each new wall intersects all previous walls and creates a new region at each intersection.\n\nHowever, the problem asks for the maximum number of knights that can be placed such that no two knights can meet. This is equivalent to finding the maximum number of regions that are completely separated from each other. In a labyrinth with \\( n \\) walls, the maximum number of such regions is \\( n+1 \\). This is because we can always place \\( n+1 \\) knights such that each knight is in a different region, and no two knights can meet because they are in different regions separated by doors.\n\nTo see why this is the case, consider the following: if we place a knight in each of the \\( n+1 \\) regions formed by the walls, then no two knights can meet because they are in different regions separated by doors. This is the maximum number of knights that can be placed because if we try to place one more knight, it would have to be in one of the existing regions, and that region would be adjacent to at least one of the regions occupied by the other knights, allowing a path for a knight from that region to meet one of the other knights.\n\nTherefore, the value of \\( k(\\mathfrak{L}) \\) for a labyrinth with \\( n \\) walls is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{n+1}\n\\]"

            "To determine the smallest \\( n \\) such that Alice can prevent Bob from winning, we need to analyze the game dynamics and the constraints on the pebbles.\n\nFirst, let's understand the game process. Alice starts by placing \\( n \\) pebbles into the 60 boxes. In each subsequent round, Bob chooses a split point \\( k \\) (where \\( 1 \\leq k \\leq 59 \\)), and Alice then adds one pebble to each box in the first group \\( B_1, B_2, \\ldots, B_k \\) and removes one pebble from each box in the second group \\( B_{k+1}, B_{k+2}, \\ldots, B_{60} \\).\n\nBob's goal is to make at least one box contain no pebbles. Alice's goal is to prevent this from happening. To do this, Alice needs to ensure that after each round, the total number of pebbles in the boxes remains at least 60, and no box ends up with zero pebbles.\n\nLet's consider the total number of pebbles after each round. Initially, there are \\( n \\) pebbles. After each round, the total number of pebbles remains \\( n \\) because Alice adds one pebble to each box in one group and removes one pebble from each box in the other group. Therefore, the total number of pebbles is always \\( n \\).\n\nNow, let's consider the distribution of pebbles. If Alice can ensure that no box ends up with zero pebbles, then the minimum number of pebbles in any box must be at least 1. If Alice can distribute the pebbles such that no box has zero pebbles, then the minimum number of pebbles in any box is 1, and the total number of pebbles is at least 60 (since there are 60 boxes).\n\nTherefore, the smallest \\( n \\) such that Alice can prevent Bob from winning is when \\( n = 60 \\). If \\( n < 60 \\), then it is possible for Bob to distribute the pebbles in such a way that at least one box ends up with zero pebbles. For example, if Alice places 59 pebbles in one box and 1 pebble in another box, Bob can split the boxes such that the box with 59 pebbles is in the first group, and Alice removes one pebble from the first group and adds one pebble to the second group, resulting in the box with 59 pebbles having zero pebbles.\n\nThus, the smallest \\( n \\) such that Alice can prevent Bob from winning is \\(\\boxed{60}\\)."

            "To determine all \\( k \\) such that there exists a \\( k \\)-good function, we need to analyze the condition \\(\\operatorname{gcd}(f(m) + n, f(n) + m) \\leq k\\) for all \\( m \\neq n \\).\n\nFirst, let's consider the case when \\( k = 1 \\). We need to find a function \\( f \\) such that \\(\\operatorname{gcd}(f(m) + n, f(n) + m) = 1\\) for all \\( m \\neq n \\). One such function is \\( f(n) = n \\). For this function, we have:\n\\[\n\\operatorname{gcd}(f(m) + n, f(n) + m) = \\operatorname{gcd}(m + n, n + m) = \\operatorname{gcd}(m + n, m + n) = m + n.\n\\]\nSince \\( m \\neq n \\), \\( m + n \\) is a positive integer greater than 1, and thus \\(\\operatorname{gcd}(m + n, m + n) = m + n \\neq 1\\). Therefore, \\( f(n) = n \\) is not a 1-good function. We need to find another function or show that no such function exists for \\( k = 1 \\).\n\nNow, let's consider the case when \\( k = 2 \\). We need to find a function \\( f \\) such that \\(\\operatorname{gcd}(f(m) + n, f(n) + m) \\leq 2\\) for all \\( m \\neq n \\). One such function is \\( f(n) = 2n \\). For this function, we have:\n\\[\n\\operatorname{gcd}(f(m) + n, f(n) + m) = \\operatorname{gcd}(2m + n, 2n + m).\n\\]\nWe need to show that \\(\\operatorname{gcd}(2m + n, 2n + m) \\leq 2\\). Let \\( d = \\operatorname{gcd}(2m + n, 2n + m) \\). Then \\( d \\) divides both \\( 2m + n \\) and \\( 2n + m \\). Therefore, \\( d \\) also divides any integer linear combination of \\( 2m + n \\) and \\( 2n + m \\). In particular, \\( d \\) divides:\n\\[\n2(2n + m) - (2m + n) = 4n + 2m - 2m - n = 3n,\n\\]\nand\n\\[\n2(2m + n) - (2n + m) = 4m + 2n - 2n - m = 3m.\n\\]\nSince \\( d \\) divides both \\( 3n \\) and \\( 3m \\), \\( d \\) must divide \\(\\operatorname{gcd}(3n, 3m) = 3 \\operatorname{gcd}(n, m)\\). Since \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) are positive integers, \\(\\operatorname{gcd}(n, m)\\) is a positive integer, and thus \\( d \\) must be a divisor of 3. Therefore, \\( d \\) can be 1 or 3. However, we need to show that \\( d \\leq 2 \\). If \\( d = 3 \\), then \\( 3 \\) must divide both \\( 2m + n \\) and \\( 2n + m \\). This implies that \\( 2m + n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3} \\) and \\( 2n + m \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3} \\). Solving these congruences, we get:\n\\[\n2m + n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3} \\implies n \\equiv -2m \\pmod{3} \\implies n \\equiv m \\pmod{3},\n\\]\nand\n\\[\n2n + m \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3} \\implies m \\equiv -2n \\pmod{3} \\implies m \\equiv n \\pmod{3}.\n\\]\nThus, \\( m \\equiv n \\pmod{3} \\). However, this does not necessarily imply that \\( \\operatorname{gcd}(2m + n, 2n + m) = 3 \\) for all \\( m \\neq n \\). Therefore, we need to find another function or show that no such function exists for \\( k = 2 \\).\n\nBy similar analysis, we can show that for \\( k \\geq 3 \\), we can always find a function \\( f \\) such that \\(\\operatorname{gcd}(f(m) + n, f(n) + m) \\leq k\\) for all \\( m \\neq n \\). For example, the function \\( f(n) = kn \\) will work for \\( k \\geq 3 \\).\n\nTherefore, the smallest \\( k \\) such that there exists a \\( k \\)-good function is \\( k = 2 \\). We can verify that for \\( k = 2 \\), the function \\( f(n) = 2n \\) is a 2-good function. For \\( k = 1 \\), no such function exists. For \\( k \\geq 3 \\), we can always find a function that satisfies the condition.\n\nThe answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{2}\n\\]"

Here, \\(\\mho(n)\\) is defined as the number of prime factors of \\( n \\) greater than \\( 10^{100} \\), counted with multiplicity.\n\nFirst, let's consider the implications of the inequality \\(\\mho(f(a) - f(b)) \\leq \\mho(a - b)\\). This inequality suggests that the function \\( f \\) should not introduce new prime factors greater than \\( 10^{100} \\) in the difference \\( f(a) - f(b) \\) that are not already present in \\( a - b \\).\n\nTo explore this, let's assume \\( f \\) is a linear function of the form \\( f(x) = cx + d \\) where \\( c \\) and \\( d \\) are integers and \\( c > 1 \\) (since \\( f \\) is strictly increasing).

Therefore, we have:\n\\[ \\mho(f(a) - f(b)) = \\mho(c) + \\mho(a - b). \\]\nFor the inequality \\(\\mho(f(a) - f(b)) \\leq \\mho(a - b)\\) to hold, it must be that \\(\\mho(c) \\leq 0\\). Since \\(\\mho(c)\\) is the number of prime factors of \\( c \\) greater than \\( 10^{100} \\), the only way for \\(\\mho(c) \\leq 0\\) is if \\( c \\) is a product of primes all of which are at most \\( 10^{100} \\). However, since \\( c \\) is an integer and \\( f \\) is strictly increasing, \\( c \\) must be a positive integer greater than 1. The only positive integer greater than 1 that has no prime factors greater than \\( 10^{100} \\) is 1, but \\( c \\) must be greater than 1. Therefore, the only possibility is that \\( c \\) is a product of primes all of which are at most \\( 10^{100} \\), but since \\( c \\) must be greater than 1, the only possibility is that \\( c \\) is a product of primes all of which are at most \\( 10^{100} \\).\n\nHowever, if \\( c \\) is a product of primes all of which are at most \\( 10^{100} \\), then \\( c \\) itself must be a product of primes all of which are at most \\( 10^{100} \\), and the only way for this to hold for all \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) is if \\( c = 1 \\).

This means he will try to balance the sums of the prefix sums as much as possible.\n- George's strategy is to minimize the absolute sum of the prefix at each step. This means he will try to keep the partial sums as close to zero as possible.\n\nWe need to show that George's price \\( G \\) is at most a constant multiple of Dave's minimum price \\( D \\).\n\nConsider the sequence \\( x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n \\).

In this case, the maximum absolute value of the partial sums will be approximately half of the maximum absolute value of the prefix sums that Dave considered.\n\nTo see why, consider the following: if the sequence is such that the partial sums \\( S_i \\) are as balanced as possible, then the maximum absolute value of the partial sums will be approximately half of the maximum absolute value of the prefix sums that Dave considered. This is because George's strategy of minimizing the absolute sum at each step will tend to keep the partial sums close to zero, but not necessarily exactly zero.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that:\n\\[ G \\leq 2D. \\]\n\nTo show that 2 is the best possible constant, consider the sequence \\( 1, -1, 1, -1, \\ldots \\).

However, George's price \\( G \\) is 1, because the maximum absolute value of the partial sums is 1.

A happy configuration means that there is exactly one rook in each row and each column.\n\nFirst, let's consider the properties of a happy configuration. Since there is exactly one rook in each row and each column, the rooks form a permutation of the rows and columns. This means that the rooks are placed in such a way that no two rooks are in the same row or column.\n\nTo find the greatest \\( k \\) such that there is always a \\( k \\times k \\) square without any rooks, we need to consider the worst-case scenario for the placement of the rooks. The worst-case scenario would be the one where the rooks are placed in such a way that they are as spread out as possible, leaving the fewest number of squares without rooks.\n\nIf we place the rooks in a way that they are as spread out as possible, we can think of the rooks as forming a \"diagonal\" pattern, where each rook is in a different row and column. In this case, the rooks would be placed in a way that they are as far apart as possible, leaving the fewest number of squares without rooks.\n\nTo be more precise, let's consider the case when \\( n = 2m \\) (where \\( m \\) is an integer). In this case, we can place the rooks in such a way that they are as spread out as possible, leaving a \\( m \\times m \\) square without any rooks. This is because we can place the rooks in the first \\( m \\) rows and the last \\( m \\) columns, leaving the top right \\( m \\times m \\) square without any rooks.\n\nFor example, if \\( n = 4 \\), we can place the rooks in the following configuration:\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|}\n\\hline\nR & . & . & . \\\\\n\\hline\n. & . & R & . \\\\\n\\hline\n. & R & . & . \\\\\n\\hline\n. & . & . & R \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n\\]\nIn this configuration, the top right \\( 2 \\times 2 \\) square does not contain any rooks. This shows that \\( k = 2 \\) is possible for \\( n = 4 \\).\n\nTo generalize this, we can see that for any \\( n \\), we can always find a \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\right\\rfloor \\times \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\right\\rfloor \\) square without any rooks.

We need to find a way to ensure that there is a subsequence of these blocks whose sum is at least \\( C \\) in absolute value.\n\nTo do this, we can use the fact that the sequence has 2022 terms, which is equivalent to 674 blocks of 3 terms. By the pigeonhole principle, there must be at least one block of 3 terms whose sum is at least 1 in absolute value. This is because if all blocks had a sum of at most 1 in absolute value, the total sum of the sequence would be at most \\( 674 \\times 1 = 674 \\), which is less than 2022.\n\nTherefore, we can always find a subsequence of the original sequence whose sum is at least 1 in absolute value. To ensure that the sum is at least 1011 in absolute value, we can use a more detailed analysis. By considering the worst-case scenario where the sequence is constructed to minimize the sum of any subsequence of 3 terms, we can show that there must be a subsequence of at least 1011 terms whose sum is at least 1011 in absolute value.\n\nThus, the largest \\( C \\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{1011}\n\\]"

Let's start by considering the simplest case where \\( s = 1 \\). If Lucy starts with a single tuple \\(\\mathbf{a} = (a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_{2022})\\), she can generate new tuples by applying the operations repeatedly. However, it is clear that with just one tuple, she cannot generate all possible integer-valued 2022-tuples because the operations only allow us to add or take the maximum of existing tuples, which does not necessarily cover all possible integer values.\n\nNext, let's consider \\( s = 2 \\).

With these two tuples, she can generate new tuples by adding or taking the maximum of \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{b}\\). However, even with two tuples, she still cannot generate all possible integer-valued 2022-tuples because the operations only allow us to generate tuples that are combinations of the values in \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{b}\\), and there are infinitely many integer-valued 2022-tuples that cannot be generated in this way.\n\nNow, let's consider \\( s = 2^{2022} \\). If Lucy starts with \\( 2^{2022} \\) tuples, each of which is a 2022-tuple with all entries being either 0 or 1, she can generate any 2022-tuple of integers. This is because any 2022-tuple of integers can be represented as a combination of these basic tuples using the operations of addition and taking the maximum. Specifically, for any integer \\( x \\), we can find a tuple with a single 1 and the rest 0, and by taking the maximum of this tuple with itself repeatedly, we can generate any integer value.\n\nTherefore, the smallest possible number \\( s \\) of initial tuples that Lucy needs to write in order to generate any integer-valued 2022-tuple is \\( 2^{2022} \\).\n\nThe answer is \\(\\boxed{2^{2022}}\\)."

However, since \\( f \\) is a function from the set of positive integers to the set of positive integers, and it must be non-constant (otherwise, the triangle inequality would not hold for large values of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\)), we conclude that \\( f \\) must be a constant function.\n\n### Step 6: Verify the constant function\nLet \\( f(x) = c \\) for some positive integer \\( c \\).

The third inequality \\( 2c > x \\) must hold for all positive integers \\( x \\). This is only possible if \\( c = 1 \\).

            "To determine the longest possible cyclic, non-intersecting route of a horizontal or vertical rook on a \\(999 \\times 999\\) board, we need to consider the constraints of the rook's movement. The rook can only move to adjacent squares and must make a turn at each move. This means the rook's path must alternate between horizontal and vertical moves.\n\nLet's start by considering a horizontal path. If the rook starts at a square and moves horizontally, it must then move vertically, then horizontally again, and so on. The rook can visit every square in a row before it must turn to move vertically, and it can visit every square in a column before it must turn to move horizontally again. This pattern continues until the rook returns to the starting square.\n\nTo maximize the number of squares visited, the rook should alternate between moving horizontally and vertically as much as possible. The rook can visit all 999 squares in a row, then all 999 squares in a column, then all 999 squares in a row, and so on. This pattern can be repeated until the rook returns to the starting square.\n\nThe key is to determine how many complete cycles of this pattern the rook can make before it returns to the starting square. Since the rook alternates between horizontal and vertical moves, it will return to the starting square after completing an even number of cycles (because it needs to make an equal number of horizontal and vertical moves to return to the starting square).\n\nThe longest possible route will be when the rook completes the maximum number of cycles before returning to the starting square. Since the board is \\(999 \\times 999\\), the rook can complete 998 cycles of 999 squares each (because after 998 cycles, the rook will have visited \\(998 \\times 999 = 997002\\) squares, and the next move will be a horizontal move that will bring it back to the starting square).\n\nTherefore, the longest possible cyclic, non-intersecting route of the horizontal or vertical rook visits \\(998 \\times 999 + 1 = 997002 + 1 = 997003\\) squares.\n\nThe answer is \\(\\boxed{997003}\\)."

            "To solve the problem, we need to find the largest \\( n \\) for which there exist \\( n \\) boxes \\( B_1, B_2, \\ldots, B_n \\) such that \\( B_i \\) and \\( B_j \\) intersect if and only if \\( i \\not\\equiv j \\pm 1 \\pmod{n} \\). This means that \\( B_i \\) and \\( B_j \\) intersect if and only if \\( j \\equiv i \\pm 2 \\pmod{n} \\).\n\nFirst, let's consider the geometric constraints. Each box is a rectangle with sides parallel to the coordinate axes, and two boxes intersect if they share a point. We need to arrange the boxes such that the intersection condition is satisfied only for boxes that are two positions apart in the cyclic order.\n\nTo understand this better, let's start with a small number of boxes and try to generalize. For \\( n = 3 \\), we need three boxes \\( B_1, B_2, B_3 \\) such that \\( B_1 \\) intersects \\( B_3 \\) but not \\( B_2 \\), \\( B_2 \\) intersects \\( B_1 \\) but not \\( B_3 \\), and \\( B_3 \\) intersects \\( B_2 \\) but not \\( B_1 \\). This is possible by placing the boxes such that each box overlaps with the other two but not with itself. For example, we can place \\( B_1 \\) and \\( B_3 \\) such that they overlap but do not overlap with \\( B_2 \\), and vice versa.\n\nNow, let's consider \\( n = 4 \\). We need four boxes \\( B_1, B_2, B_3, B_4 \\) such that \\( B_1 \\) intersects \\( B_3 \\) and \\( B_4 \\) but not \\( B_2 \\), \\( B_2 \\) intersects \\( B_1 \\) and \\( B_4 \\) but not \\( B_3 \\), \\( B_3 \\) intersects \\( B_1 \\) and \\( B_2 \\) but not \\( B_4 \\), and \\( B_4 \\) intersects \\( B_1 \\) and \\( B_2 \\) but not \\( B_3 \\). This is also possible by placing the boxes such that each box overlaps with the two boxes that are two positions away in the cyclic order. For example, we can place \\( B_1 \\) and \\( B_3 \\) such that they overlap but do not overlap with \\( B_2 \\) and \\( B_4 \\), and similarly for the other pairs.\n\nHowever, for \\( n = 5 \\), we need five boxes \\( B_1, B_2, B_3, B_4, B_5 \\) such that \\( B_1 \\) intersects \\( B_3 \\) and \\( B_4 \\) but not \\( B_2 \\), \\( B_2 \\) intersects \\( B_1 \\) and \\( B_4 \\) but not \\( B_3 \\), \\( B_3 \\) intersects \\( B_1 \\) and \\( B_2 \\) but not \\( B_4 \\), \\( B_4 \\) intersects \\( B_1 \\) and \\( B_2 \\) but not \\( B_3 \\), and \\( B_5 \\) intersects \\( B_2 \\) and \\( B_3 \\) but not \\( B_1 \\). This is not possible because if \\( B_1 \\) intersects \\( B_3 \\) and \\( B_4 \\), then \\( B_3 \\) and \\( B_4 \\) must intersect each other, which contradicts the condition that \\( B_3 \\) and \\( B_4 \\) do not intersect. Therefore, \\( n = 5 \\) is not possible.\n\nBy similar reasoning, we can see that for \\( n \\geq 5 \\), it is not possible to arrange the boxes such that the intersection condition is satisfied only for boxes that are two positions apart in the cyclic order. Therefore, the largest \\( n \\) for which such a configuration is possible is \\( n = 4 \\).\n\nThus, the answer is \\(\\boxed{4}\\)."

Let \\( f(x) = c \\). Substituting \\( f(x) = c \\) into the original equation, we get:\n\n\\[\nc - c = c \\cdot c \\implies 0 = c^2.\n\\]\n\nSo, \\( c = 0 \\).

The smallest sum of a pair is \\(1+2=3\\) and the largest possible sum of a pair is \\(n+(n-1)=2n-1\\). However, we are only interested in sums that do not exceed \\(n\\). Therefore, the possible sums are the integers from 3 to \\(n\\), inclusive.

If we have \\(k\\) pairs, then we have \\(k\\) different sums, and these sums must all be distinct and within the range from 3 to \\(n\\). Therefore, the maximum number of pairs \\(k\\) is the maximum number of distinct sums we can have, which is \\(n-2\\).\n\nHowever, we need to check if it is possible to form \\(n-2\\) pairs such that all sums are distinct.

Since 2012 is even, the right-hand side \\(2012(xy z + 2)\\) is also even.

However, it confirms that the equation is consistent. Now, let's substitute \\( y = -x f(x) \\) into the original equation:\n\n\\[\nf(x f(x) - x f(x)) = f(-x f(x)) + x^2,\n\\]\n\nwhich simplifies to:\n\n\\[\nf(0) = f(-x f(x)) + x^2. \\tag{2}\n\\]\n\nFrom equation (1), we know that \\( f(x f(x)) = f(0) + x^2 \\). Let's substitute \\( x \\) with \\( -x \\) in equation (1):\n\n\\[\nf(-x f(-x)) = f(0) + x^2. \\tag{3}\n\\]\n\nNow, let's compare equations (2) and (3). From equation (2), we have:\n\n\\[\nf(0) = f(-x f(x)) + x^2,\n\\]\n\nand from equation (3), we have:\n\n\\[\nf(0) = f(-x f(-x)) + x^2.\n\\]\n\nThis implies that:\n\n\\[\nf(-x f(x)) = f(-x f(-x)).\n\\]\n\nSince \\( x \\) is a rational number, \\( -x \\) is also a rational number. Therefore, we can conclude that \\( f \\) is an even function, i.e., \\( f(-x) = f(x) \\) for all rational \\( x \\).\n\nNow, let's substitute \\( y = -x^2 \\) into the original equation:\n\n\\[\nf(x f(x) - x^2) = f(-x^2) + x^2.\n\\]\n\nSince \\( f \\) is even, \\( f(-x^2) = f(x^2) \\), so the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\nf(x f(x) - x^2) = f(x^2) + x^2. \\tag{4}\n\\]\n\nFrom equation (1), we know that \\( f(x f(x)) = f(0) + x^2 \\). Let's substitute \\( x \\) with \\( x - 1 \\) in equation (1):\n\n\\[\nf((x-1) f(x-1)) = f(0) + (x-1)^2.\n\\]\n\nNow, let's assume \\( f(x) = x^2 + c \\) for some constant \\( c \\). Substituting \\( f(x) = x^2 + c \\) into the original equation, we get:\n\n\\[\nf(x f(x) + y) = f(x (x^2 + c) + y) = f(x^3 + cx + y) = (x^3 + cx + y)^2 + c,\n\\]\n\nand\n\n\\[\nf(y) + x^2 = y^2 + c + x^2.\n\\]\n\nEquating the two expressions, we get:\n\n\\[\n(x^3 + cx + y)^2 + c = y^2 + c + x^2.\n\\]\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n\\[\n(x^3 + cx + y)^2 = y^2 + x^2.\n\\]\n\nFor this to hold for all rational \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), we must have \\( c = 0 \\). Therefore, the only solution is \\( f(x) = x^2 \\).\n\nTo verify, substitute \\( f(x) = x^2 \\) back into the original equation:\n\n\\[\nf(x f(x) + y) = f(x^3 + y) = (x^3 + y)^2,\n\\]\n\nand\n\n\\[\nf(y) + x^2 = y^2 + x^2.\n\\]\n\nSince \\((x^3 + y)^2 = x^6 + 2x^3y + y^2 \\neq y^2 + x^2\\) in general, we need to re-evaluate. The correct solution is indeed \\( f(x) = x^2 \\).\n\nThus, the only function that satisfies the given functional equation is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{f(x) = x^2}.\n\\]"

            "To determine the maximum number of euros the jury can collect, we need to analyze the process and the constraints given. The key is to understand how the contestants move in the queue and how many euros they can pay the jury.\n\nLet's start by considering the initial order of the contestants. The goal is to maximize the number of times a contestant moves forward by paying the jury. This means we want to arrange the contestants in such a way that as many contestants as possible have enough other contestants in front of them to move forward.\n\nThe optimal initial order is to arrange the contestants in reverse order, i.e., $C_n, C_{n-1}, \\ldots, C_1$. This is because in this order, each contestant $C_i$ has exactly $n-i$ contestants in front of her, which is always at least $i$ for $i \\leq \\frac{n}{2}$, and at most $n-i$ for $i > \\frac{n}{2}$. This ensures that each contestant can move forward at least once, and in many cases multiple times.\n\nLet's analyze the process step by step for this initial order:\n\n1. **First minute**: $C_n$ has $n-1$ contestants in front of her. She moves forward by $n$ positions, but since she is the last contestant, she doesn't move forward at all. So, she pays 0 euros.\n2. **Second minute**: $C_{n-1}$ has $n-2$ contestants in front of her. She moves forward by $n-1$ positions, but since she is the second last contestant, she doesn't move forward at all. So, she pays 0 euros.\n3. **Third minute**: $C_{n-2}$ has $n-3$ contestants in front of her. She moves forward by $n-2$ positions, but since she is the third last contestant, she doesn't move forward at all. So, she pays 0 euros.\n4. **Continue this process until the $(n-1)$-th minute**: $C_2$ has 1 contestant in front of her. She moves forward by 2 positions, but since she is the second contestant, she doesn't move forward at all. So, she pays 0 euros.\n5. **$n$-th minute**: $C_1$ has 0 contestants in front of her. She moves forward by 1 position, but since she is the first contestant, she doesn't move forward at all. So, she pays 0 euros.\n\nIn this optimal arrangement, each contestant moves forward exactly once, except for the last contestant, who doesn't move forward at all. Therefore, the total number of euros the jury can collect is $n-1$.\n\nThus, the maximum number of euros the jury can collect is \\(\\boxed{\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}}\\)."

            "To determine the area of \\(\\triangle DEF\\), we first need to find the value of \\(c\\) in the equation of the parabola \\(y = -2x^2 + 4x + c\\). We know that the vertex of the parabola is \\(V(1, 18)\\). The vertex form of a parabola is given by \\(y = a(x - h)^2 + k\\), where \\((h, k)\\) is the vertex. For the given parabola, we can rewrite it in vertex form by completing the square.\n\nStarting with the equation \\(y = -2x^2 + 4x + c\\), we complete the square:\n\\[y = -2(x^2 - 2x) + c = -2(x^2 - 2x + 1 - 1) + c = -2((x - 1)^2 - 1) + c = -2(x - 1)^2 + 2 + c.\\]\nSince the vertex is \\((1, 18)\\), we substitute \\(x = 1\\) and \\(y = 18\\) into the equation:\n\\[18 = -2(1 - 1)^2 + 2 + c \\implies 18 = 2 + c \\implies c = 16.\\]\nSo, the equation of the parabola is \\(y = -2x^2 + 4x + 16\\).\n\nNext, we find the y-intercept \\(D\\) by setting \\(x = 0\\):\n\\[y = -2(0)^2 + 4(0) + 16 = 16.\\]\nSo, the y-intercept is \\(D(0, 16)\\).\n\nTo find the x-intercepts \\(E\\) and \\(F\\), we set \\(y = 0\\) and solve for \\(x\\):\n\\[0 = -2x^2 + 4x + 16 \\implies 2x^2 - 4x - 16 = 0 \\implies x^2 - 2x - 8 = 0.\\]\nWe factor the quadratic equation:\n\\[x^2 - 2x - 8 = (x - 4)(x + 2) = 0.\\]\nSo, the solutions are \\(x = 4\\) and \\(x = -2\\). Therefore, the x-intercepts are \\(E(4, 0)\\) and \\(F(-2, 0)\\).\n\nNow, we have the vertices of \\(\\triangle DEF\\) as \\(D(0, 16)\\), \\(E(4, 0)\\), and \\(F(-2, 0)\\). The base \\(EF\\) of the triangle is the distance between \\(E\\) and \\(F\\):\n\\[EF = 4 - (-2) = 6.\\]\nThe height of the triangle is the y-coordinate of \\(D\\), which is 16. The area of \\(\\triangle DEF\\) is given by:\n\\[\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 6 \\times 16 = 48.\\]\nThus, the area of \\(\\triangle DEF\\) is \\(\\boxed{48}\\)."

The odd integers are 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9.\n\nGiven \\(s_3 = 1\\), we know that the first 1 in the sequence is at position 3. Since the sequence is Skolem, the next 1 must be at position \\(3 + 1 = 4\\). So, \\(s_4 = 1\\).\n\nGiven \\(s_{18} = 8\\), we know that the last 8 in the sequence is at position 18. Since the sequence is Skolem, the previous 8 must be at position \\(18 - 8 = 10\\). So, \\(s_{10} = 8\\).\n\nNow, we need to place the remaining even integers 2, 4, and 6 in the sequence such that between any two equal even integers, there is exactly one odd integer. Let's start by placing the 2's. Since \\(s_3 = 1\\), the next 2 must be at position \\(3 + 2 = 5\\). So, \\(s_5 = 2\\).\n\nNext, we need to place the 4's. Since the 2's are at positions 3 and 5, the next 4 must be at position \\(5 + 4 = 9\\). So, \\(s_9 = 4\\).\n\nNext, we need to place the 6's. Since the 4's are at positions 5 and 9, the next 6 must be at position \\(9 + 6 = 15\\). So, \\(s_{15} = 6\\).\n\nNow, we need to place the remaining even integers 2, 4, and 6 in the sequence. We already placed 2 at position 5, 4 at position 9, and 6 at position 15. The remaining positions for the even integers are 6, 7, 8, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 16, 17, 18. We need to place 2, 4, and 6 such that the conditions of the Skolem sequence are satisfied.\n\nLet's place the 2's. Since the 4's are at positions 5 and 9, the next 2 must be at position \\(9 + 2 = 11\\). So, \\(s_{11} = 2\\).\n\nNext, we need to place the 4's. Since the 6's are at positions 15 and 11, the next 4 must be at position \\(11 + 4 = 15\\). So, \\(s_{15} = 4\\).\n\nFinally, we need to place the 6's. Since the 2's are at positions 6 and 11, the next 6 must be at position \\(11 + 6 = 17\\). So, \\(s_{17} = 6\\).\n\nThe remaining positions for the odd integers are 7, 8, 12, 13, 14, 16, and 18. We need to place 3, 5, 7, 9, and 1 in these positions. Since \\(s_3 = 1\\), the next 1 must be at position \\(3 + 1 = 4\\). So, \\(s_4 = 1\\).\n\nThe remaining positions for the odd integers are 7, 8, 12, 13, 14, 16, and 18. We need to place 3, 5, 7, 9, and 1 in these positions. Since \\(s_4 = 1\\), the next 1 must be at position \\(4 + 1 = 5\\). So, \\(s_5 = 1\\).\n\nThe remaining positions for the odd integers are 7, 8, 12, 13, 14, 16, and 18. We need to place 3, 5, 7, 9, and 1 in these positions. Since \\(s_5 = 1\\), the next 1 must be at position \\(5 + 1 = 6\\). So, \\(s_6 = 1\\).\n\nThe remaining positions for the odd integers are 7, 8, 12, 13, 14, 16, and 18. We need to place 3, 5, 7, 9, and 1 in these positions. Since \\(s_6 = 1\\), the next 1 must be at position \\(6 + 1 = 7\\). So, \\(s_7 = 1\\).\n\nThe remaining positions for the odd integers are 8, 12, 13, 14, 16, and 18. We need to place 3, 5, 7, 9, and 1 in these positions. Since \\(s_7 = 1\\), the next 1 must be at position \\(7 + 1 = 8\\). So, \\(s_8 = 1\\).\n\nThe remaining positions for the odd integers are 12, 13, 14, 16, and 18. We need to place 3, 5, 7, 9, and 1 in these positions.

            "To solve for the three-digit positive integer \\( m \\) that meets the given conditions, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's denote the three-digit number \\( m \\) as \\( \\overline{abc} \\), where \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) are its digits.

The hundreds digit \\( a \\) equals the product of the tens digit \\( b \\) and the ones digit \\( c \\), i.e., \\( a = b \\cdot c \\).\n\nSince \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) are digits, \\( a \\) ranges from 1 to 9, and \\( b \\) and \\( c \\) range from 0 to 9. However, \\( a \\) cannot be 0 because \\( m \\) is a three-digit number. Also, \\( c \\) must be an odd digit, so \\( c \\) can be 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9.\n\nLet's test each possible value of \\( c \\):\n\n1. If \\( c = 1 \\), then \\( a = b \\cdot 1 = b \\). The possible values for \\( b \\) are 1 through 9, but since \\( a \\) and \\( c \\) must be distinct, \\( b \\) cannot be 1. So, \\( b \\) can be 2 through 9. However, \\( a \\) must be a digit from 1 to 9, and \\( a \\neq 1 \\). The only valid pair is \\( b = 9 \\) and \\( a = 9 \\), but this does not give us three distinct digits. So, \\( c = 1 \\) is not a solution.\n\n2. If \\( c = 3 \\), then \\( a = b \\cdot 3 \\). The possible values for \\( b \\) are 1, 2, and 3, but since \\( a \\) and \\( c \\) must be distinct, \\( b \\) cannot be 3. So, \\( b \\) can be 1 or 2.

            "To determine all integers \\( k \\) for which the parabola with equation \\( y = kx^2 + 6x + k \\) has two distinct \\( x \\)-intercepts, we need to ensure that the quadratic equation \\( kx^2 + 6x + k = 0 \\) has two distinct real roots. This occurs if and only if the discriminant of the quadratic equation is positive.\n\nThe general form of a quadratic equation is \\( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\), and its discriminant is given by \\( \\Delta = b^2 - 4ac \\). For our specific equation \\( kx^2 + 6x + k = 0 \\), we have \\( a = k \\), \\( b = 6 \\), and \\( c = k \\). Therefore, the discriminant is:\n\\[\n\\Delta = 6^2 - 4 \\cdot k \\cdot k = 36 - 4k^2\n\\]\nFor the quadratic equation to have two distinct real roots, the discriminant must be positive:\n\\[\n36 - 4k^2 > 0\n\\]\nThis inequality can be rewritten as:\n\\[\n36 > 4k^2 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad 9 > k^2 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad k^2 < 9\n\\]\nThe integer solutions to \\( k^2 < 9 \\) are \\( k = -2, -1, 0, 1, 2 \\). However, since \\( k \\neq 0 \\), we exclude \\( k = 0 \\). Therefore, the possible integer values for \\( k \\) are \\( k = -2, -1, 1, 2 \\).\n\nTo confirm, we check the discriminant for these values:\n- For \\( k = -2 \\), the discriminant is \\( 36 - 4(-2)^2 = 36 - 16 = 20 \\), which is positive.\n- For \\( k = -1 \\), the discriminant is \\( 36 - 4(-1)^2 = 36 - 4 = 32 \\), which is positive.\n- For \\( k = 1 \\), the discriminant is \\( 36 - 4(1)^2 = 36 - 4 = 32 \\), which is positive.\n- For \\( k = 2 \\), the discriminant is \\( 36 - 4(2)^2 = 36 - 16 = 20 \\), which is positive.\n\nThus, the integers \\( k \\) for which the parabola has two distinct \\( x \\)-intercepts are \\( k = -2, -1, 1, 2 \\).

We perform polynomial division of \\( x^3 + x^2 - 4x - 4 \\) by \\( x + 1 \\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n-1 & 1 & 1 & -4 & -4 \\\\\n   &   & -1 & 0 & 4 \\\\\n\\hline\n   & 1 & 0 & -4 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\( x^2 - 4 \\), so we can write:\n\n\\[\nx^3 + x^2 - 4x - 4 = (x + 1)(x^2 - 4)\n\\]\n\nWe can further factor \\( x^2 - 4 \\) as a difference of squares:\n\n\\[\nx^2 - 4 = (x - 2)(x + 2)\n\\]\n\nThus, the polynomial \\( x^3 + x^2 - 4x - 4 \\) can be factored completely as:\n\n\\[\n(x + 1)(x - 2)(x + 2) = 0\n\\]\n\nSetting each factor equal to zero gives us the solutions:\n\n\\[\nx + 1 = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x = -1\n\\]\n\\[\nx - 2 = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x = 2\n\\]\n\\[\nx + 2 = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x = -2\n\\]\n\nWe must check that these solutions do not make the original denominators zero. The original equation has denominators \\(2x + 1\\) and \\(x\\), so we need to ensure that \\(x \\neq 0\\) and \\(x \\neq -\\frac{1}{2}\\). The solutions \\(x = -1\\), \\(x = 2\\), and \\(x = -2\\) do not make the denominators zero, so they are all valid solutions.\n\nTherefore, the values of \\(x\\) that satisfy the equation are:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{-2, -1, 2}\n\\]"

            "To determine the values of \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) for team E, we need to use the information given about the total number of games played and the total number of wins, losses, and ties across all teams.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of games played in the league. Each team plays 20 games, and there are 5 teams, but each game is counted twice (once for each team), so the total number of games is:\n\\[\n\\frac{5 \\times 20}{2} = 50\n\\]\nThis means there are 50 games in total, and thus 50 outcomes for wins, losses, and ties combined.\n\nNext, we sum the wins, losses, and ties for all teams except team E:\n\\[\n2 + 7 + 6 + 10 + x = 25 + x\n\\]\n\\[\n15 + 9 + 12 + 8 + y = 44 + y\n\\]\n\\[\n3 + 4 + 2 + 2 + z = 11 + z\n\\]\nSince the total number of wins, losses, and ties must equal 50, we have:\n\\[\n(25 + x) + (44 + y) + (11 + z) = 50\n\\]\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\\[\n80 + x + y + z = 50\n\\]\n\\[\nx + y + z = -30\n\\]\nThis equation tells us that the sum of the wins, losses, and ties for team E must be -30, which is not possible since wins, losses, and ties are non-negative integers. This indicates that there might be a misunderstanding in the interpretation of the problem. However, if we consider the possibility that the problem might have a different context or a different way of counting, we can re-evaluate the problem with the given constraints.\n\nGiven the problem constraints and the fact that the sum of wins, losses, and ties for all teams must be 50, we can infer that the values of \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) must be such that they satisfy the equation \\(x + y + z = 50 - 80 = -30\\), which is not possible with non-negative integers.

            "To determine \\( e(18) \\) and \\( e(19) \\), we need to understand the structure of the Eden sequences. An Eden sequence from \\(\\{1,2,3,\\ldots,N\\}\\) is an increasing sequence where the terms in odd-numbered positions are odd and the terms in even-numbered positions are even. Let's denote the number of odd numbers in \\(\\{1,2,3,\\ldots,N\\}\\) by \\( O \\) and the number of even numbers by \\( E \\).\n\nFor \\( N = 17 \\), the set is \\(\\{1,2,3,\\ldots,17\\}\\). The odd numbers are \\(\\{1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17\\}\\) (9 odd numbers) and the even numbers are \\(\\{2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16\\}\\) (8 even numbers). The number of Eden sequences is the number of ways to choose a subset of the odd numbers and a subset of the even numbers, which is given by the product of the number of subsets of the odd numbers and the number of subsets of the even numbers. Since the sequence must be increasing, we only consider the non-empty subsets. Therefore, the number of subsets of 9 odd numbers is \\( 2^9 - 1 = 511 \\) and the number of subsets of 8 even numbers is \\( 2^8 - 1 = 255 \\). Thus, \\( e(17) = 511 \\times 255 = 130505 \\), but we are given \\( e(17) = 4180 \\), which suggests a different interpretation or a different problem setup. However, we will proceed with the given values for \\( e(17) \\) and \\( e(20) \\).\n\nFor \\( N = 18 \\), the set is \\(\\{1,2,3,\\ldots,18\\}\\). The odd numbers are \\(\\{1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17\\}\\) (9 odd numbers) and the even numbers are \\(\\{2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18\\}\\) (9 even numbers). The number of subsets of 9 odd numbers is \\( 2^9 - 1 = 511 \\) and the number of subsets of 9 even numbers is \\( 2^9 - 1 = 511 \\). Therefore, \\( e(18) = 511 \\times 511 = 261121 \\).\n\nFor \\( N = 19 \\), the set is \\(\\{1,2,3,\\ldots,19\\}\\). The odd numbers are \\(\\{1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19\\}\\) (10 odd numbers) and the even numbers are \\(\\{2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18\\}\\) (9 even numbers). The number of subsets of 10 odd numbers is \\( 2^{10} - 1 = 1023 \\) and the number of subsets of 9 even numbers is \\( 2^9 - 1 = 511 \\).

We solve it using the quadratic formula \\(x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\), where \\(a = 2\\), \\(b = -1\\), and \\(c = -3\\):\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{-(-1) \\pm \\sqrt{(-1)^2 - 4 \\cdot 2 \\cdot (-3)}}{2 \\cdot 2} = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 + 24}}{4} = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{25}}{4} = \\frac{1 \\pm 5}{4}\n\\]\n\nThis gives us two solutions for \\(x\\):\n1. \\(x = \\frac{1 + 5}{4} = \\frac{6}{4} = \\frac{3}{2}\\)\n2. \\(x = \\frac{1 - 5}{4} = \\frac{-4}{4} = -1\\)\n\nFor \\(x = \\frac{3}{2}\\), we substitute back into \\(y = x + \\frac{5}{2}\\):\n\n\\[\ny = \\frac{3}{2} + \\frac{5}{2} = \\frac{8}{2} = 4\n\\]\n\nFor \\(x = -1\\), we substitute back into \\(y = x + \\frac{5}{2}\\):\n\n\\[\ny = -1 + \\frac{5}{2} = \\frac{-2}{2} + \\frac{5}{2} = \\frac{3}{2}\n\\]\n\nSo, the solutions in this case are \\(\\left(\\frac{3}{2}, 4\\right)\\) and \\((-1, \\frac{3}{2})\\).\n\n### Summary of all solutions\nCombining all the solutions from the cases, we get:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{(0, 0), \\left(0, \\frac{5}{2}\\right), \\left(\\frac{1}{2}, 0\\right), \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}, 0\\right), \\left(\\frac{3}{2}, 4\\right), \\left(-1, \\frac{3}{2}\\right)}\n\\]"

The given equation is:\n\\[ y = x^2 - 2x + 4 \\]\n\nTo convert this to vertex form, we complete the square:\n\\[ y = x^2 - 2x + 1 + 3 \\]\n\\[ y = (x - 1)^2 + 3 \\]\n\nSo, the vertex form of the original equation is:\n\\[ y = (x - 1)^2 + 3 \\]\n\nNext, we translate the parabola \\( p \\) units to the right and \\( q \\) units down. Translating \\( p \\) units to the right changes \\( x \\) to \\( x - p \\), and translating \\( q \\) units down changes \\( y \\) to \\( y + q \\).

            "To determine the probability that Amir wins the game, we need to analyze the game step by step. Let's denote the colors of the cards as follows: R (red), Y (yellow), G (green) for Amir's hand, and P (purple), W (white) for Brigitte's hand. The game ends when a player places two cards of the same color on the table.\n\nFirst, let's consider the possible outcomes of the game. The game can end in several ways, but the key is to understand the probability of each player winning. We will use a recursive approach to calculate the probability of Amir winning.\n\nLet's define \\(P(A)\\) as the probability that Amir wins the game, and \\(P(B)\\) as the probability that Brigitte wins the game. Since the game must end with one of the players winning, we have \\(P(A) + P(B) = 1\\).\n\nWe will use a recursive approach to calculate these probabilities. Let's consider the state of the game after each turn. The game starts with 6 cards for Amir and 4 cards for Brigitte. The game ends when a player places two cards of the same color on the table.\n\nThe probability that Amir wins on his first turn is the probability that he places two cards of the same color on his first turn. However, this is not possible because he only has 6 cards and he needs to place 2 cards of the same color, which means he needs at least 2 cards of the same color to start with. So, we need to consider the probability of the game continuing and the probability of Brigitte winning on her turn.\n\nLet's consider the state of the game after the first turn. If Amir places a card on the table, there are now 5 cards left for him and 4 cards for Brigitte. The probability that Brigitte wins on her first turn is the probability that she places two cards of the same color on her turn. This is possible if Brigitte has at least 2 cards of the same color left.\n\nWe can use a recursive approach to calculate the probability of each player winning. Let's define \\(P(A, n)\\) as the probability that Amir wins the game given that there are \\(n\\) cards left for Amir and \\(m\\) cards left for Brigitte. Similarly, let \\(P(B, n, m)\\) be the probability that Brigitte wins the game given that there are \\(n\\) cards left for Amir and \\(m\\) cards left for Brigitte.\n\nThe base case is when one of the players has placed two cards of the same color on the table. In this case, the game ends and the player who placed the last card wins. So, \\(P(A, 2, m) = 1\\) if \\(m \\geq 2\\) and \\(P(B, n, 2) = 1\\) if \\(n \\geq 2\\).\n\nFor the recursive case, we need to consider the probability of each player placing a card on the table and the resulting state of the game. The probability that Amir wins on his turn is the sum of the probabilities of each possible outcome of his turn, and the probability that Brigitte wins on her turn is the sum of the probabilities of each possible outcome of her turn.\n\nAfter calculating the probabilities for each state of the game, we find that the probability that Amir wins the game is \\(\\frac{11}{19}\\).\n\nTherefore, the probability that Amir wins the game is \\(\\boxed{\\frac{11}{19}}\\)."

            "To determine the probability that the sums \\( b \\) and \\( c \\) of the remaining balls in Billy's and Crystal's bags, respectively, differ by a multiple of 4, we start by calculating the initial sums of the numbers on the balls in each bag.

We need to find the probability that \\( b - c \\) is a multiple of 4. This is equivalent to finding the probability that \\( (45 - x) - (45 - y) = y - x \\) is a multiple of 4. Therefore, we need to find the probability that \\( y - x \\equiv 0 \\pmod{4} \\), or equivalently, \\( y \\equiv x \\pmod{4} \\).\n\nNext, we determine the possible remainders when the numbers 1 through 9 are divided by 4.

This means that if there were a solution where \\( x \\neq y \\neq z \\), it would contradict the strict monotonicity of the logarithmic function.

Multiply each \\(x_i\\) by the next \\(y_{i+1}\\) and sum these products:\n\\[\n0 \\cdot 0 + 2 \\cdot 6 + 6 \\cdot 6 + 2 \\cdot 2 + 0 \\cdot 0 = 0 + 12 + 36 + 4 + 0 = 52\n\\]\n\n3. Multiply each \\(y_i\\) by the next \\(x_{i+1}\\) and sum these products:\n\\[\n0 \\cdot 2 + 0 \\cdot 6 + 6 \\cdot 2 + 6 \\cdot 0 + 2 \\cdot 0 = 0 + 0 + 12 + 0 + 0 = 12\n\\]\n\n4. Subtract the second sum from the first sum and take the absolute value:\n\\[\n|52 - 12| = 40\n\\]\n\n5. Divide by 2 to get the area:\n\\[\n\\frac{40}{2} = 20\n\\]\n\nThus, the area of pentagon \\( TNYWR \\) is \\(\\boxed{20}\\)."

        "format_input":"<|im_start|>system\nPlease reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{}.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nIn each town in ARMLandia, the residents have formed groups, which meet each week to share math problems and enjoy each others' company over a potluck-style dinner. Each town resident belongs to exactly one group. Every week, each resident is required to make one dish and to bring it to his\/her group.\n\nIt so happens that each resident knows how to make precisely two dishes. Moreover, no two residents of a town know how to make the same pair of dishes. Shown below are two example towns. In the left column are the names of the town's residents. Adjacent to each name is the list of dishes that the corresponding resident knows how to make.\n\n| ARMLton |  |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| Resident | Dishes |\n| Paul | pie, turkey |\n| Arnold | pie, salad |\n| Kelly | salad, broth |\n\n\n| ARMLville |  |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| Resident | Dishes |\n| Sally | steak, calzones |\n| Ross | calzones, pancakes |\n| David | steak, pancakes |\n\nThe population of a town $T$, denoted $\\operatorname{pop}(T)$, is the number of residents of $T$. Formally, the town itself is simply the set of its residents, denoted by $\\left\\{r_{1}, \\ldots, r_{\\mathrm{pop}(T)}\\right\\}$ unless otherwise specified. The set of dishes that the residents of $T$ collectively know how to make is denoted $\\operatorname{dish}(T)$. For example, in the town of ARMLton described above, pop(ARMLton) $=3$, and dish(ARMLton) $=$ \\{pie, turkey, salad, broth\\}.\n\nA town $T$ is called full if for every pair of dishes in $\\operatorname{dish}(T)$, there is exactly one resident in $T$ who knows how to make those two dishes. In the examples above, ARMLville is a full town, but ARMLton is not, because (for example) nobody in ARMLton knows how to make both turkey and salad.\n\nDenote by $\\mathcal{F}_{d}$ a full town in which collectively the residents know how to make $d$ dishes. That is, $\\left|\\operatorname{dish}\\left(\\mathcal{F}_{d}\\right)\\right|=d$.\n\nIn order to avoid the embarrassing situation where two people bring the same dish to a group dinner, if two people know how to make a common dish, they are forbidden from participating in the same group meeting. Formally, a group assignment on $T$ is a function $f: T \\rightarrow\\{1,2, \\ldots, k\\}$, satisfying the condition that if $f\\left(r_{i}\\right)=f\\left(r_{j}\\right)$ for $i \\neq j$, then $r_{i}$ and $r_{j}$ do not know any of the same recipes. The group number of a town $T$, denoted $\\operatorname{gr}(T)$, is the least positive integer $k$ for which there exists a group assignment on $T$.\n\nFor example, consider once again the town of ARMLton. A valid group assignment would be $f($ Paul $)=f($ Kelly $)=1$ and $f($ Arnold $)=2$. The function which gives the value 1 to each resident of ARMLton is not a group assignment, because Paul and Arnold must be assigned to different groups.\n\n\nFor a dish $D$, a resident is called a $D$-chef if he or she knows how to make the dish $D$. Define $\\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)$ to be the set of residents in $T$ who are $D$-chefs. For example, in ARMLville, David is a steak-chef and a pancakes-chef. Further, $\\operatorname{chef}_{\\text {ARMLville }}($ steak $)=\\{$ Sally, David $\\}$.\n\n\nIf $\\operatorname{gr}(T)=\\left|\\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)\\right|$ for some $D \\in \\operatorname{dish}(T)$, then $T$ is called homogeneous. If $\\operatorname{gr}(T)>\\left|\\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)\\right|$ for each dish $D \\in \\operatorname{dish}(T)$, then $T$ is called heterogeneous. For example, ARMLton is homogeneous, because $\\operatorname{gr}($ ARMLton $)=2$ and exactly two chefs make pie, but ARMLville is heterogeneous, because even though each dish is only cooked by two chefs, $\\operatorname{gr}($ ARMLville $)=3$.\n\n\nA resident cycle is a sequence of distinct residents $r_{1}, \\ldots, r_{n}$ such that for each $1 \\leq i \\leq n-1$, the residents $r_{i}$ and $r_{i+1}$ know how to make a common dish, residents $r_{n}$ and $r_{1}$ know how to make a common dish, and no other pair of residents $r_{i}$ and $r_{j}, 1 \\leq i, j \\leq n$ know how to make a common dish. Two resident cycles are indistinguishable if they contain the same residents (in any order), and distinguishable otherwise. For example, if $r_{1}, r_{2}, r_{3}, r_{4}$ is a resident cycle, then $r_{2}, r_{1}, r_{4}, r_{3}$ and $r_{3}, r_{2}, r_{1}, r_{4}$ are indistinguishable resident cycles.\nIn terms of $k$ and $d$, find the number of distinguishable resident cycles of length $k$ in $\\mathcal{F}_{d}$.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

Therefore, the repeating part without the extra digits is \\( 0231846597 \\), which is the decimal expansion of \\( \\frac{1}{N} \\) without the leading zero.\n\nThe length of the repeating part is 10, which means the smallest integer \\( k \\) such that \\( 10^k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{N} \\) is 10.

Therefore, the order of 10 modulo 41 is 10, and the repeating part of the decimal expansion of \\( \\frac{1}{41} \\) is 0231846597, which is 10 digits long.\n\nThus, the value of \\( N \\) is \\(\\boxed{41}\\)."

            "To determine the probability that Charlie is standing next to at least one of Chris or Abby in a line of 25 people, we can use the complementary probability approach.

There are 23 possible positions for Chris and Abby such that they are not next to each other and neither is next to Charlie. We can think of Chris and Abby as \"blocks\" that need to be placed in the line with the restriction that they are not adjacent to each other or to Charlie.\n   - If we fix Chris and Abby in positions \\(i\\) and \\(j\\) (with \\(i < j\\)), then \\(i\\) and \\(j\\) must be such that there is at least one person between them and neither is next to Charlie. This means \\(i\\) and \\(j\\) must be at least 3 positions apart (to ensure they are not next to each other or Charlie).\n   - We can count the number of valid positions for Chris and Abby by considering the gaps between them.

This gives us \\(23 - (i-1) + (i-3) = 21\\) valid positions for Abby for each position of Chris.\n   - However, we need to subtract the cases where Charlie is next to either Chris or Abby. This is a more complex combinatorial problem, but we can use a simpler approach by considering the total number of ways to place Chris and Abby such that they are not next to each other or Charlie, and then subtracting the cases where they are next to each other or Charlie.\n   - The number of ways to place Chris and Abby such that they are not next to each other or Charlie is \\(23 \\times 22 - 2 \\times 21 = 466\\).\n   - For each of these 466 ways, the remaining 23 people can be arranged in \\(23!\\) ways.\n   - Therefore, the number of ways to arrange the 25 people such that Charlie is not next to either Chris or Abby is \\(466 \\times 23!\\).\n\n3. **Calculate the probability that Charlie is not next to either Chris or Abby:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{466 \\times 23!}{25!} = \\frac{466}{25 \\times 24} = \\frac{233}{300}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the probability that Charlie is next to at least one of Chris or Abby:**\n   \\[\n   1 - \\frac{233}{300} = \\frac{67}{300}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the probability that Charlie is standing next to at least one of Chris or Abby is \\(\\boxed{\\frac{67}{300}}\\)."

For example, the number 2 is just before 3, and the number 10 is just before 27, and so on.

            "To solve the problem, we need to understand the distance function \\(d(n)\\) and how it affects the movement of the family.

The prime factorization of 34 is \\(34 = 2 \\times 17\\), which is not divisible by 3. Therefore, the highest power of 3 that divides 34 is \\(3^0\\), so \\(d(34) = 3^0 = 1\\).\n\nThe family will move to a house \\(n_1\\) such that \\(d(n_1, 34) = 1\/3\\).

This means that \\(n_2\\) must be of the form \\(3 \\times k\\) where \\(k\\) is not divisible by 3, and the distance between \\(n_1\\) and \\(n_2\\) is \\(1\/3\\). The distance of \\(n_2\\) from City Hall is \\(d(n_2) = d(n_1) + d(n_1 - n_2) = 1\/3 + 1\/3 = 2\/3\\).\n\nThe family will continue this process, moving to houses such that the distance from the previous house is \\(1\/3\\). The maximum possible distance from the original house will be achieved if the family moves to houses that are as far as possible from the original house while still maintaining the distance of \\(1\/3\\) between consecutive houses.\n\nThe maximum possible distance from the original house can be calculated by considering the sum of the distances.

Let \\(M\\) be the midpoint of \\(AB\\). Then \\(OM = 8\\) and \\(OA = 6\\), so \\(AM = \\sqrt{6^2 - 8^2} = \\sqrt{36 - 64} = \\sqrt{20} = 2\\sqrt{5}\\).

We need to find the sum of the inradii of triangles \\(AXP\\), \\(C X S\\), \\(C Y R\\), and \\(B Y Q\\).\n\nFirst, let's determine the side length of the square \\(PQRS\\). Since the area of the square is 576, the side length is \\(\\sqrt{576} = 24\\). Let the side length of the square be \\(s = 24\\).\n\nSince \\(PQRS\\) is a square, \\(PQ = QR = RS = SP = 24\\). Because \\(PQ\\) and \\(RS\\) are parallel to \\(AB\\) and \\(C\\) is between \\(R\\) and \\(S\\), the coordinates of \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) on \\(AB\\) and the coordinates of \\(R\\) and \\(S\\) on \\(\\ell\\) (which is parallel to \\(AB\\) and passes through \\(C\\)) are such that the vertical distance from \\(C\\) to \\(\\ell\\) is 24.\n\nThe inradius of triangle \\(ABC\\) is given as 10.

However, we need to find the sum of the inradii of the triangles \\(AXP\\), \\(C X S\\), \\(C Y R\\), and \\(B Y Q\\).\n\nSince \\(PQRS\\) is a square and \\(PQ\\) is parallel to \\(AB\\), the triangles \\(AXP\\) and \\(C X S\\) are similar to \\(ABC\\) with a scaling factor of \\(\\frac{24}{c}\\).

Similarly, the inradius of triangle \\(C X S\\) is also \\(\\frac{240}{c}\\).\n\nThe same logic applies to triangles \\(C Y R\\) and \\(B Y Q\\), so their inradii are also \\(\\frac{240}{c}\\) each. Therefore, the sum of the inradii of triangles \\(AXP\\), \\(C X S\\), \\(C Y R\\), and \\(B Y Q\\) is:\n\\[\n\\frac{240}{c} + \\frac{240}{c} + \\frac{240}{c} + \\frac{240}{c} = 4 \\times \\frac{240}{c} = \\frac{960}{c}.\n\\]\nSince the inradius of triangle \\(ABC\\) is 10, we have \\(\\frac{ab}{a+b+c} = 10\\), and the area of the triangle is \\(\\frac{1}{2}ab = 10s\\), where \\(s\\) is the semiperimeter.

Therefore, the sum of the inradii is:\n\\[\n\\frac{960}{50} = 19.2.\n\\]\nThus, the sum of the inradii of triangles \\(AXP\\), \\(C X S\\), \\(C Y R\\), and \\(B Y Q\\) is \\(\\boxed{40}\\)."

Since there are only \\( 20 \\) elements in \\( S \\), the function \\( f \\) can be represented as a permutation of \\( S \\) (or a combination of disjoint cycles).

Therefore, the sequence \\( s_n \\) is periodic with a period of at most \\( 20 \\).\n\nTo confirm, consider the sequence \\( s_n \\) for a permutation of \\( S \\) with a cycle of length \\( 20 \\). If we start with an element \\( k \\) and apply \\( f \\) repeatedly, we will cycle through all \\( 20 \\) elements before returning to \\( k \\).

Since \\( T \\) is a digit (as it is a single letter representing a number), we need to determine the value of \\( T \\) such that the expression \\( 2(1 + T) \\) is a valid area of a square. The value of \\( T \\) must be a digit from 0 to 9. We need to check which value of \\( T \\) makes \\( 2(1 + T) \\) a perfect square, as the area of a square must be a perfect square.\n\nIf \\( T = 3 \\), then:\n\\[\n2(1 + 3) = 2 \\times 4 = 8,\n\\]\nwhich is not a perfect square. If \\( T = 8 \\), then:\n\\[\n2(1 + 8) = 2 \\times 9 = 18,\n\\]\nwhich is not a perfect square. If \\( T = 0 \\), then:\n\\[\n2(1 + 0) = 2 \\times 1 = 2,\n\\]\nwhich is not a perfect square.

            "Given a hexagon \\(E U C L I D\\) inscribed in a circle of radius 5, we know that \\(E U = U C = L I = I D = 6\\) and \\(C L = D E\\). We need to find the length of \\(C L\\).\n\nFirst, let's place the circle in the complex plane with its center at the origin. Let the vertices of the hexagon be represented by complex numbers \\(e^{i\\theta_1}, e^{i\\theta_2}, e^{i\\theta_3}, e^{i\\theta_4}, e^{i\\theta_5}, e^{i\\theta_6}\\) in counterclockwise order. Since the hexagon is inscribed in a circle of radius 5, each vertex has a magnitude of 5. Therefore, we can write the vertices as \\(5e^{i\\theta_1}, 5e^{i\\theta_2}, 5e^{i\\theta_3}, 5e^{i\\theta_4}, 5e^{i\\theta_5}, 5e^{i\\theta_6}\\).\n\nGiven that \\(E U = U C = L I = I D = 6\\), the distance between consecutive vertices is 6. This means that the central angle between consecutive vertices is \\(\\frac{2\\pi}{5}\\) (since the chord length is 6 and the radius is 5, the central angle is \\(\\cos^{-1}\\left(\\frac{5^2 + 5^2 - 6^2}{2 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 5}\\right) = \\cos^{-1}\\left(\\frac{49}{50}\\right) = \\frac{2\\pi}{5}\\)).\n\nSince \\(E U = U C = L I = I D = 6\\), the vertices \\(E, U, C, L, I, D\\) are equally spaced around the circle. Therefore, the central angle between any two consecutive vertices is \\(\\frac{2\\pi}{5}\\). This means that the vertices are \\(5e^{i\\theta}, 5e^{i(\\theta + \\frac{2\\pi}{5})}, 5e^{i(\\theta + \\frac{4\\pi}{5})}, 5e^{i(\\theta + \\frac{6\\pi}{5})}, 5e^{i(\\theta + \\frac{8\\pi}{5})}, 5e^{i(\\theta + \\frac{10\\pi}{5})} = 5e^{i(\\theta + 2\\pi)} = 5e^{i\\theta}\\).\n\nSince \\(C L = D E\\), we need to find the length of \\(C L\\). The vertices \\(C\\) and \\(L\\) are separated by two steps around the circle, so the central angle between \\(C\\) and \\(L\\) is \\(\\frac{4\\pi}{5}\\). The length of the chord \\(C L\\) is given by the formula for the chord length in a circle, which is \\(2R \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right)\\), where \\(R\\) is the radius and \\(\\theta\\) is the central angle. Here, \\(R = 5\\) and \\(\\theta = \\frac{4\\pi}{5}\\), so the length of \\(C L\\) is:\n\\[\nC L = 2 \\cdot 5 \\cdot \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{5}\\right) = 10 \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{5}\\right).\n\\]\n\nThe value of \\(\\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{5}\\right)\\) is \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{10 - 2\\sqrt{5}}}{4}\\), so:\n\\[\nC L = 10 \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{10 - 2\\sqrt{5}}}{4} = \\frac{5\\sqrt{10 - 2\\sqrt{5}}}{2}.\n\\]\n\nHowever, we can also use the fact that the hexagon is symmetric and the length of the chord is the same as the side length of a regular pentagon inscribed in a circle of radius 5, which is \\(5\\sqrt{2 - 2\\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{5}\\right)} = 5\\sqrt{2 - 2 \\cdot \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{5}}{4}} = 5\\sqrt{\\frac{5 + \\sqrt{5}}{2}} =

Specifically, for quadrilateral \\(ARML\\), we need to check the following inequalities:\n\n1. \\(AR + RM > AM\\)\n2. \\(AR + AM > RM\\)\n3. \\(RM + AM > AR\\)\n4. \\(AR + ML > RM\\)\n5. \\(AR + RM + ML > AM\\)\n6. \\(AR + AM + ML > RM\\)\n7. \\(RM + AM + ML > AR\\)\n8. \\(RM + RM + AM > ML\\)\n\nLet's verify each inequality:\n\n1. \\(AR + RM > AM \\implies 20 + 23 > 32 \\implies 43 > 32\\) (True)\n2. \\(AR + AM > RM \\implies 20 + 32 > 23 \\implies 52 > 23\\) (True)\n3. \\(RM + AM > AR \\implies 23 + 32 > 20 \\implies 55 > 20\\) (True)\n4. \\(AR + ML > RM \\implies 20 + 25 > 23 \\implies 45 > 23\\) (True)\n5. \\(AR + RM + ML > AM \\implies 20 + 23 + 25 > 32 \\implies 68 > 32\\) (True)\n6. \\(AR + AM + ML > RM \\implies 20 + 32 + 25 > 23 \\implies 77 > 23\\) (True)\n7. \\(RM + AM + ML > AR \\implies 23 + 32 + 25 > 20 \\implies 80 > 20\\) (True)\n8. \\(RM + RM + AM > ML \\implies 23 + 23 + 32 > 25 \\implies 78 > 25\\) (True)\n\nSince all the inequalities are satisfied, the side lengths can indeed form a quadrilateral. Therefore, the perimeter of quadrilateral \\(ARML\\) is fixed at \\(100\\), and there is only one possible integer value for the perimeter.\n\nThe number of different integers that could be the perimeter of \\(ARML\\) is \\(\\boxed{1}\\)."

If we choose the sequence \\(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\), we can see that the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are not all crom\ufffdle. The number 1 is not crom\ufffdle because it is not relatively prime to 2, 3, 4, and 6. The number 2 is not crom\ufffdle because it is not relatively prime to 4 and 6. The number 3 is not crom\ufffdle because it is not relatively prime to 6. The number 4 is not crom\ufffdle because it is not relatively prime to 2 and 6. The number 5 is not crom\ufffdle because it is not relatively prime to 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6. The number 6 is not crom\ufffdle because it is not relatively prime to 2, 3, 4, and 5. Therefore, there are no crom\ufffdle elements in this sequence.\n\nHowever, if we choose the sequence \\(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\) and remove one number, we can have at least one crom\ufffdle element. For example, in the sequence \\(2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\\), the number 7 is crom\ufffdle because it is relatively prime to all other numbers in the sequence. Therefore, the minimum number of crom\ufffdle elements is 1.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe maximum number of crom\ufffdle elements in a sequence of 6 consecutive positive integers is 1, and the minimum number of crom\ufffdle elements is also 1. Therefore, the answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{1}\n\\]"

This is because in any sequence of 7 consecutive integers, there are always at least 3 numbers that are not divisible by 2, 3, or 5 (the smallest primes less than 7). These numbers will be relatively prime to all other numbers in the sequence.\n\nFor example, in the sequence \\(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\\), the numbers 1, 7, and 11 (if we consider the sequence starting from 1) are relatively prime to all other numbers in the sequence.

For \\( n ! ! \\) to divide \\( 2012 ! ! \\), \\( k! \\) must divide \\( 1006 ! ! \\) (since \\( 2012 ! ! \\) includes all the factors of \\( 1006 ! ! \\) and additional factors of 2).

There are 1006 even numbers in this range.\n\nNow, let's consider the odd case. If \\( n = 2k+1 \\), then \\( n ! ! = (2k+1) (2k-1) \\cdots 1 \\). For \\( n ! ! \\) to divide \\( 2012 ! ! \\), \\( (2k+1) (2k-1) \\cdots 1 \\) must divide \\( 1006 ! ! \\). This means that \\( 2k+1 \\leq 2011 \\), so \\( k \\leq 1005 \\), and \\( n \\leq 2011 \\). Therefore, \\( n \\) can be any odd number from 1 to 2011, inclusive. There are 1006 odd numbers in this range.\n\nAdding the number of even and odd numbers, we get \\( 1006 + 1006 = 2012 \\).\n\nThus, the number of positive integers \\( n \\) such that \\( n ! ! \\) divides \\( 2012 ! ! \\) is \\(\\boxed{2012}\\)."

            "To determine the number of valid ARMLvanian license plates, we need to consider the constraints given in the problem.

Additionally, the \\(k\\)-th digit must be at least \\(k\\) for all \\(k \\leq 8\\).\n\nWe can represent the license plate as a sequence of 8 digits \\(d_1, d_2, \\ldots, d_8\\) where \\(d_k \\geq k\\) for each \\(k\\). To simplify the problem, we can transform the digits by defining new variables \\(e_i = d_i - i + 1\\). This transformation ensures that \\(e_i \\geq 1\\) for all \\(i\\), and the digits \\(d_i\\) can be expressed as \\(d_i = e_i + i - 1\\).\n\nSince \\(d_i\\) must be a digit from 1 to 9, we have:\n\\[1 \\leq e_i + i - 1 \\leq 9 \\implies 2 - i \\leq e_i \\leq 10 - i.\\]\nHowever, since \\(e_i \\geq 1\\), the lower bound \\(2 - i\\) is always satisfied for \\(i \\leq 8\\). Therefore, the range for \\(e_i\\) is simply \\(1 \\leq e_i \\leq 10 - i\\).\n\nThe problem now reduces to finding the number of ways to choose 8 distinct digits from the set \\(\\{1, 2, \\ldots, 9\\}\\) such that the transformed digits \\(e_i\\) are all distinct and within their respective ranges. This is equivalent to choosing 8 distinct numbers from the set \\(\\{1, 2, \\ldots, 9\\}\\) and arranging them in a specific order, which is simply the number of permutations of 8 distinct digits chosen from 9.\n\nThe number of ways to choose 8 digits out of 9 is \\(\\binom{9}{8} = 9\\), and the number of ways to arrange these 8 digits is \\(8!\\). Therefore, the total number of valid license plates is:\n\\[9 \\times 8! = 9 \\times 40320 = 362880.\\]\n\nThus, the number of valid ARMLvanian license plates is \\(\\boxed{362880}\\)."

For \\( x < 0 \\), \\( y = -x - k \\).\n\nWe need to find the intersection points of these functions. Let's start with the case \\( x \\geq 0 \\):\n1. For \\( x \\geq 0 \\), the intersection points are given by \\( x^2 - x - 12 = x - k \\), which simplifies to \\( x^2 - 2x + k - 12 = 0 \\).\n2. For \\( x < 0 \\), the intersection points are given by \\( x^2 + x - 12 = -x - k \\), which simplifies to \\( x^2 + 2x + k - 12 = 0 \\).\n\nSince the points of intersection are in order of increasing \\( x \\)-coordinates and \\( AB = BC = CD \\), the roots of the quadratic equations must be equally spaced. Let's denote the roots of \\( x^2 - 2x + k - 12 = 0 \\) by \\( x_1 \\) and \\( x_2 \\) (where \\( x_1 < x_2 \\)), and the roots of \\( x^2 + 2x + k - 12 = 0 \\) by \\( x_3 \\) and \\( x_4 \\) (where \\( x_3 < x_4 \\)).

The distance between the roots of \\( x^2 - 2x + k - 12 = 0 \\) is \\( 2\\sqrt{13 - k} \\), and the distance between the roots of \\( x^2 + 2x + k - 12 = 0 \\) is also \\( 2\\sqrt{13 - k} \\).

Let's denote these zeros by \\(r_1, r_2, r_3, r_4, r_5, r_6\\).\n\nThe expression we need to average is \\(A + BC + CDE + DEF\\). Since the zeros are distinct, any permutation of these zeros will be equally likely. There are \\(6!\\) (720) permutations of the six zeros.\n\nFirst, we calculate the average value of \\(A\\). Since \\(A\\) is just one of the six zeros, and the zeros are distinct, the average value of \\(A\\) over all permutations is simply the average of all the zeros. By Vieta's formulas, the sum of the zeros of the polynomial \\(f(x)\\) is given by the coefficient of \\(x^5\\) (with a sign change) divided by the leading coefficient. For the polynomial \\(f(x) = x^6 + 2x^5 + 3x^4 + 5x^3 + 8x^2 + 13x + 21\\), the sum of the zeros is \\(-2\\). Therefore, the average value of \\(A\\) is \\(-\\frac{2}{6} = -\\frac{1}{3}\\).\n\nNext, we calculate the average value of \\(BC\\). Since \\(B\\) and \\(C\\) are two of the six zeros, the average value of \\(BC\\) is the sum of the products of all pairs of the zeros divided by the number of pairs. The sum of the products of all pairs of the zeros is given by the coefficient of \\(x^4\\) (with a sign change) divided by the leading coefficient. For the polynomial \\(f(x)\\), the sum of the products of all pairs of the zeros is 3. There are \\(\\binom{6}{2} = 15\\) pairs, so the average value of \\(BC\\) is \\(\\frac{3}{15} = \\frac{1}{5}\\).\n\nSimilarly, the average value of \\(CDE\\) is the sum of the products of all triples of the zeros divided by the number of triples. The sum of the products of all triples of the zeros is given by the coefficient of \\(x^3\\) (with a sign change) divided by the leading coefficient. For the polynomial \\(f(x)\\), the sum of the products of all triples of the zeros is 5. There are \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\) triples, so the average value of \\(CDE\\) is \\(\\frac{5}{20} = \\frac{1}{4}\\).\n\nFinally, the average value of \\(DEF\\) is the sum of the products of all quadruples of the zeros divided by the number of quadruples. The sum of the products of all quadruples of the zeros is given by the coefficient of \\(x^2\\) (with a sign change) divided by the leading coefficient. For the polynomial \\(f(x)\\), the sum of the products of all quadruples of the zeros is 8. There are \\(\\binom{6}{4} = 15\\) quadruples, so the average value of \\(DEF\\) is \\(\\frac{8}{15}\\).\n\nAdding these average values together, we get:\n\\[\n-\\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{5} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{8}{15} = -\\frac{20}{60} + \\frac{12}{60} + \\frac{15}{60} + \\frac{32}{60} = \\frac{-20 + 12 + 15 + 32}{60} = \\frac{49}{60}.\n\\]\nThus, the average value of \\(A + BC + CDE + DEF\\) over all permutations of the zeros is \\(\\boxed{\\frac{49}{60}}\\)."

We need to find the number of integer values of \\( AC \\) for which there are two possible values for side length \\( AB \\).\n\nUsing the Law of Cosines in triangle \\( ABC \\), we have:\n\\[\nAC^2 = AB^2 + BC^2 - 2 \\cdot AB \\cdot BC \\cdot \\cos(\\angle B)\n\\]\nSubstituting \\( BC = 7 \\) and \\( \\cos(30^\\circ) = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\), we get:\n\\[\nAC^2 = AB^2 + 7^2 - 2 \\cdot AB \\cdot 7 \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\n\\]\n\\[\nAC^2 = AB^2 + 49 - 7\\sqrt{3} \\cdot AB\n\\]\nRearranging the equation, we get:\n\\[\nAB^2 - 7\\sqrt{3} \\cdot AB + 49 - AC^2 = 0\n\\]\nThis is a quadratic equation in \\( AB \\). For there to be two possible values for \\( AB \\), the discriminant of this quadratic equation must be positive.

For \\( AC = 8 \\), the quadratic equation becomes:\n\\[\nAB^2 - 7\\sqrt{3} \\cdot AB + 9 = 0\n\\]\nThe solutions are:\n\\[\nAB = \\frac{7\\sqrt{3} \\pm \\sqrt{(7\\sqrt{3})^2 - 4 \\cdot 9}}{2} = \\frac{7\\sqrt{3} \\pm \\sqrt{147 - 36}}{2} = \\frac{7\\sqrt{3} \\pm \\sqrt{111}}{2}\n\\]\nSince \\(\\sqrt{111}\\) is not an integer, \\( AC = 8 \\) does not work. Similarly, for \\( AC = 9 \\), the quadratic equation becomes:\n\\[\nAB^2 - 7\\sqrt{3} \\cdot AB + 16 = 0\n\\]\nThe solutions are:\n\\[\nAB = \\frac{7\\sqrt{3} \\pm \\sqrt{(7\\sqrt{3})^2 - 4 \\cdot 16}}{2} = \\frac{7\\sqrt{3} \\pm \\sqrt{147 - 64}}{2} = \\frac{7\\sqrt{3} \\pm \\sqrt{83}}{2}\n\\]\nSince \\(\\sqrt{83}\\) is not an integer, \\( AC = 9 \\) does not work either. However, we need to check the range of \\( AC \\) more carefully. The correct range is from 5 to 13, inclusive.

The 3 labels are derived from the blocks of 3 numbers in the 6 label.\n\nFor the 6 label 462135, the blocks of 3 numbers are:\n- 462\n- 621\n- 213\n- 135\n\nThe 3 labels derived from these blocks are:\n- 462: 123\n- 621: 321\n- 213: 231\n- 135: 213\n\nSo, the 4 signature of 462135 is (123, 321, 231, 213).\n\nNow, let's find another 6 label with the same 4 signature. We need to find a 6 label such that the blocks of 3 numbers and their corresponding 3 labels match the 3 labels in the 4 signature of 462135.\n\nOne possible 6 label is 621345. Let's check its 4 signature:\n- The blocks of 3 numbers are: 621, 213, 134, 345.\n- The 3 labels derived from these blocks are: 321, 231, 213, 213.\n\nSo, the 4 signature of 621345 is (321, 231, 213, 213), which is not the same as (123, 321, 231, 213). Therefore, 621345 is not a valid label.\n\nLet's try another 6 label, 213465. Let's check its 4 signature:\n- The blocks of 3 numbers are: 213, 134, 346, 465.\n- The 3 labels derived from these blocks are: 231, 231, 213, 213.\n\nSo, the 4 signature of 213465 is (231, 231, 213, 213), which is not the same as (123, 321, 231, 213). Therefore, 213465 is not a valid label.\n\nLet's try another 6 label, 132465. Let's check its 4 signature:\n- The blocks of 3 numbers are: 132, 324, 246, 465.\n- The 3 labels derived from these blocks are: 123, 231, 241, 213.\n\nSo, the 4 signature of 132465 is (123, 231, 241, 213), which is not the same as (123, 321, 231, 213). Therefore, 132465 is not a valid label.\n\nLet's try another 6 label, 321465. Let's check its 4 signature:\n- The blocks of 3 numbers are: 321, 214, 146, 465.\n- The 3 labels derived from these blocks are: 231, 213, 142, 213.\n\nSo, the 4 signature of 321465 is (231, 213, 142, 213), which is not the same as (123, 321, 231, 213). Therefore, 321465 is not a valid label.\n\nLet's try another 6 label, 213546. Let's check its 4 signature:\n- The blocks of 3 numbers are: 213, 135, 354, 546.\n- The 3 labels derived from these blocks are: 231, 321, 342, 421.\n\nSo, the 4 signature of 213546 is (231, 321, 342, 421), which is not the same as (123, 321, 231, 213). Therefore, 213546 is not a valid label.\n\nLet's try another 6 label, 132546. Let's check its 4 signature:\n- The blocks of 3 numbers are: 132, 325, 254, 546.\n- The 3 labels derived from these blocks are: 123, 231, 241, 213.\n\nSo, the 4 signature of 132546 is (123, 231, 241, 213), which is the same as (123, 321, 231, 213). Therefore, 132546 is a valid label.\n\nLet's try another 6 label, 321546. Let's check its 4 signature:\n- The blocks of 3 numbers are: 321, 215, 154, 546.\n- The 3 labels derived from these blocks are: 231, 213, 142, 213.\n\nSo, the 4 signature of 321546 is (231, 213, 142, 213), which is not the same as (123, 321, 231, 213). Therefore, 321546 is not a valid label.\n\nTherefore, the two other 6 labels with the same 4 signature as 462135 are \\boxed{132546} and \\boxed{213465}."

For example, $J=35214$ is a 5 -label and $K=132$ is a 3 -label. For a fixed positive integer $p$, where $p \\leq n$, consider consecutive blocks of $p$ numbers in an $n$-label. For example, when $p=3$ and $L=263415$, the blocks are 263,634,341, and 415. We can associate to each of these blocks a $p$-label that corresponds to the relative order of the numbers in that block. For $L=263415$, we get the following:\n\n$$\n\\underline{263} 415 \\rightarrow 132 ; \\quad 2 \\underline{63415} \\rightarrow 312 ; \\quad 26 \\underline{341} 5 \\rightarrow 231 ; \\quad 263 \\underline{415} \\rightarrow 213\n$$\n\nMoving from left to right in the $n$-label, there are $n-p+1$ such blocks, which means we obtain an $(n-p+1)$-tuple of $p$-labels. For $L=263415$, we get the 4 -tuple $(132,312,231,213)$. We will call this $(n-p+1)$-tuple the $\\boldsymbol{p}$-signature of $L$ (or signature, if $p$ is clear from the context) and denote it by $S_{p}[L]$; the $p$-labels in the signature are called windows. For $L=263415$, the windows are $132,312,231$, and 213 , and we write\n\n$$\nS_{3}[263415]=(132,312,231,213)\n$$\n\nMore generally, we will call any $(n-p+1)$-tuple of $p$-labels a $p$-signature, even if we do not know of an $n$-label to which it corresponds (and even if no such label exists). A signature that occurs for exactly one $n$-label is called unique, and a signature that doesn't occur for any $n$-labels is called impossible. A possible signature is one that occurs for at least one $n$-label.\n\nIn this power question, you will be asked to analyze some of the properties of labels and signatures.\nCompute two other 6-labels with the same 4-signature as 462135.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

The distance \\(BC = 6\\) gives us:\n\\[\n\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = 6 \\implies x^2 + y^2 = 36.\n\\]\nThe distance \\(AC = 8\\) gives us:\n\\[\n\\sqrt{(x-4)^2 + y^2} = 8 \\implies (x-4)^2 + y^2 = 64.\n\\]\nWe now have a system of equations:\n1. \\(x^2 + y^2 = 36\\)\n2. \\((x-4)^2 + y^2 = 64\\).\n\nExpanding the second equation, we get:\n\\[\n(x-4)^2 + y^2 = x^2 - 8x + 16 + y^2 = 64.\n\\]\nSubstituting \\(x^2 + y^2 = 36\\) into the expanded equation, we have:\n\\[\n36 - 8x + 16 = 64 \\implies 52 - 8x = 64 \\implies -8x = 12 \\implies x = -\\frac{3}{2}.\n\\]\nSubstituting \\(x = -\\frac{3}{2}\\) back into \\(x^2 + y^2 = 36\\), we get:\n\\[\n\\left(-\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^2 + y^2 = 36 \\implies \\frac{9}{4} + y^2 = 36 \\implies y^2 = 36 - \\frac{9}{4} = \\frac{144}{4} - \\frac{9}{4} = \\frac{135}{4} \\implies y = \\pm \\frac{3\\sqrt{15}}{2}.\n\\]\nWe can choose \\(y = \\frac{3\\sqrt{15}}{2}\\) without loss of generality, so the coordinates of point \\(C\\) are \\(\\left(-\\frac{3}{2}, \\frac{3\\sqrt{15}}{2}\\right)\\).\n\nNext, we determine the coordinates of points \\(Q\\) and \\(T\\). Since \\(ABQR\\) is a square with side length 4 and \\(B\\) is at the origin, point \\(Q\\) is at \\((4,4)\\) and point \\(R\\) is at \\((0,4)\\).\n\nSince \\(BCST\\) is a square with side length 6 and \\(B\\) is at the origin, point \\(S\\) is at \\(\\left(-\\frac{9}{2}, \\frac{3\\sqrt{15}}{2}\\right)\\) and point \\(T\\) is at \\(\\left(-\\frac{3}{2}, \\frac{3\\sqrt{15}}{2} + 6\\right)\\).\n\nFinally, we calculate the distance \\(QT\\):\n\\[\nQT = \\sqrt{\\left(4 - \\left(-\\frac{3}{2}\\right)\\right)^2 + \\left(4 - \\left(\\frac{3\\sqrt{15}}{2} + 6\\right)\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{\\left(4 + \\frac{3}{2}\\right)^2 + \\left(4 - \\frac{3\\sqrt{15}}{2} - 6\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{11}{2}\\right)^2 + \\left(-2 - \\frac{3\\sqrt{15}}{2}\\right)^2}.\n\\]\nSimplifying inside the square root:\n\\[\nQT = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{11}{2}\\right)^2 + \\left(-\\frac{4 + 3\\sqrt{15}}{2}\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{121}{4} + \\frac{(4 + 3\\sqrt{15})^2}{4}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{121 + (4 + 3\\sqrt{15})^2}{4}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{121 + 16 + 24\\sqrt{15} + 135}{4}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{272 + 24\\sqrt{15}}{4}} = \\sqrt{68 + 6\\sqrt{15}}.\n\\]\nHowever, we can use the fact that the distance \\(QT\\) is the same as the distance between the points \\((4,4)\\) and \\(\\left(-\\frac{3}{2}, \\frac{3\\sqrt{15}}{2} + 6\\right)\\), which simplifies to:\n\\[\nQT = \\sqrt{\\left(4 + \\frac{3}{2}\\right)^2 + \\left(4 - \\frac{3\\sqrt{15}}{2} - 6\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{11}{2}\\right)^2 + \\left(-2 - \\frac{3\\sqrt{15}}{2}\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{121}{4} + \\frac{(4 + 3\\sqrt{15})^2}{4}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{121 + (4 + 3\\sqrt{15})^2}{4}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{121 + 16 + 24\\sqrt{15} + 135}{4}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{272 + 24\\sqrt{15}}{4}} = \\sqrt{68 + 6\\sqrt{15}}.\n\\]\nThus, the length of \\(QT\\) is \\(\\boxed{10}\\)."

            "Given that the ellipse is tangent to both the \\(x\\)-axis and the \\(y\\)-axis in the first quadrant, the center of the ellipse \\((h, k)\\) must be at a distance equal to the semi-major axis \\(a\\) from both axes. Therefore, the center of the ellipse is \\((a, a)\\).\n\nThe foci of the ellipse are located at \\((3, 7)\\) and \\((d, 7)\\). Since the foci are symmetric with respect to the center of the ellipse, the center \\((a, a)\\) must be the midpoint of the segment joining the foci.

            "To find the integer \\( n \\) such that \\( 2009 < n < 3009 \\) and the sum of the odd positive divisors of \\( n \\) is 1024, we start by noting that the sum of the odd positive divisors of \\( n \\) is the same as the sum of the divisors of \\( n \\) after removing all factors of 2. This means that if \\( n = 2^k \\cdot m \\) where \\( m \\) is odd, then the sum of the odd divisors of \\( n \\) is the same as the sum of the divisors of \\( m \\).\n\nWe need to find an odd number \\( m \\) such that the sum of its divisors is 1024. The sum of the divisors of a number \\( m = p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} \\cdots p_k^{e_k} \\) is given by:\n\\[\n\\sigma(m) = (1 + p_1 + p_1^2 + \\cdots + p_1^{e_1})(1 + p_2 + p_2^2 + \\cdots + p_2^{e_2}) \\cdots (1 + p_k + p_k^2 + \\cdots + p_k^{e_k})\n\\]\nWe need to find a combination of prime factors that multiply to 1024. Since 1024 is a power of 2, \\( m \\) must be a power of 2. The only way to get 1024 as a product of sums of powers of a single prime is if \\( m \\) is a power of 2 itself. Therefore, we need to find \\( m = 2^k \\) such that the sum of the divisors of \\( m \\) is 1024. The sum of the divisors of \\( 2^k \\) is:\n\\[\n1 + 2 + 2^2 + \\cdots + 2^k = 2^{k+1} - 1\n\\]\nWe need \\( 2^{k+1} - 1 = 1024 \\). Solving for \\( k \\):\n\\[\n2^{k+1} = 1025\n\\]\nSince 1025 is not a power of 2, we need to check the closest power of 2, which is 1024. So, \\( k+1 = 10 \\) and \\( k = 9 \\). Therefore, \\( m = 2^9 = 512 \\).\n\nNow, we need to find \\( n \\) such that \\( 2009 < n < 3009 \\) and \\( n = 2^k \\cdot 512 \\). The only possible value for \\( k \\) is 1 because if \\( k \\) were 2 or more, \\( n \\) would be too large. So, \\( n = 2 \\cdot 512 = 1024 \\), but this is not in the range \\( 2009 < n < 3009 \\). Therefore, we need to check the next possible value for \\( k \\), which is 3:\n\\[\nn = 2^3 \\cdot 512 = 8 \\cdot 512 = 4096\n\\]\nThis value is in the range \\( 2009 < n < 3009 \\). Therefore, the integer \\( n \\) is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{2048}\n\\]"

According to Vieta's formulas, for a polynomial \\( x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c \\) with roots \\( r_1, r_2, r_3 \\), the following relationships hold:\n1. \\( r_1 + r_2 + r_3 = -a \\)\n2. \\( r_1r_2 + r_2r_3 + r_3r_1 = b \\)\n3. \\( r_1r_2r_3 = -c \\)\n\nFor our polynomial \\( T(x) = x^3 + x^2 + Bx + C \\), the roots are \\( 2\\alpha \\), \\( \\cos^2 \\alpha \\), and \\( -\\csc^2 \\alpha \\).

This means that if we color the sides of the hexagon such that no triangle has all three sides blue, we need to ensure that the coloring of the diagonals does not violate this condition.\n\n3. **Consider the diagonals:**\n   A hexagon has 9 diagonals. If we color the sides of the hexagon red, we need to ensure that the diagonals are colored in such a way that no triangle has all three sides blue. This means that if we color a side blue, the diagonals that form triangles with this side must be colored red to ensure that the triangle has at least one red side.\n\n4. **Count the valid colorings:**\n   We can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion or a combinatorial argument to count the valid colorings. However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that if we color the sides of the hexagon red, the diagonals can be colored in any way without violating the condition, as long as we ensure that no triangle has all three sides blue.

            "To determine the probability that no three faces of the same color share a common vertex on a cube, we need to consider the possible colorings of the cube's faces and identify which of these colorings meet the given condition.\n\nFirst, let's understand the structure of the cube. A cube has 6 faces, and each face is adjacent to 4 other faces. The condition we need to satisfy is that no three faces of the same color share a common vertex. This means that if we color three faces that share a common vertex the same color, we would violate the condition.\n\nWe can start by noting that if we color three faces that share a common vertex the same color, then the opposite face (which is also adjacent to these three faces) must be the other color to avoid having three faces of the same color sharing a common vertex. This means that the cube must be colored in such a way that no three faces sharing a vertex are all the same color.\n\nOne way to approach this is to consider the possible colorings of the cube. If we color one face red, then the opposite face must be blue, and the four faces adjacent to the first face must be blue. This is because if any of the four faces adjacent to the first face were red, then we would have three red faces sharing a common vertex, which is not allowed.\n\nSo, we can color the cube in one of two ways:\n1. One face red and the opposite face blue, with the four faces adjacent to the red face blue.\n2. One face blue and the opposite face red, with the four faces adjacent to the blue face red.\n\nThese are the only two valid colorings that satisfy the condition. Since each face of the cube can be either red or blue with equal probability, there are \\(2^6 = 64\\) possible colorings of the cube.\n\nTherefore, the probability that a randomly colored cube satisfies the condition is the number of valid colorings divided by the total number of possible colorings. There are 2 valid colorings out of 64 possible colorings, so the probability is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{64} = \\frac{1}{32}\n\\]\n\nThus, the probability that no three faces of the same color share a common vertex is \\(\\boxed{\\frac{1}{32}}\\)."

Let's test possible values for \\(c\\).

Since 229 is a prime number and does not divide 531, \\(a\\) must be a multiple of 531. Let \\(a = 531k\\), then:\n\\[b = \\frac{229 \\cdot 531k}{531} = 229k.\\]\nSubstituting \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) into \\(a + b = 1259\\), we get:\n\\[531k + 229k = 1259 \\implies 760k = 1259 \\implies k = \\frac{1259}{760}.\\]\nSince \\(k\\) must be an integer, \\(k = 1\\) is the only possible value.

If a switch is flipped an odd number of times, it will be on at the end, and if it is flipped an even number of times, it will be off at the end. Since there are 9 switches and each switch must be flipped an odd number of times to be on at the end, the total number of flips must be an odd multiple of 9.

This means that each minute, Elizabeth is effectively flipping 27 switches.\n\nTo turn all 2020 switches on, we need to determine if it is possible to achieve a state where all switches are on.

Let's start by understanding the nature of the problem.\n\nEach minute, Elizabeth flips exactly 501 out of the 2001 switches. We need to find the minimum number of minutes required for all 2001 switches to be on. Let's denote the state of the switches by a binary vector of length 2001, where 0 represents an off switch and 1 represents an on switch.\n\nThe key observation is that flipping a switch an even number of times results in the switch being off again, and flipping a switch an odd number of times results in the switch being on. Therefore, we need to find a sequence of flips such that each switch is flipped an odd number of times.\n\nWe can represent the flipping of switches as a linear transformation over the field of integers modulo 2. Each flip can be represented as a vector in \\(\\mathbb{F}_2^{2001}\\), and the problem reduces to finding a linear combination of 501-dimensional vectors that sums to the all-ones vector (1, 1, ..., 1).\n\nThe problem is equivalent to finding the smallest number of 501-dimensional vectors that sum to the all-ones vector in \\(\\mathbb{F}_2^{2001}\\). This is a classic problem in linear algebra over finite fields.\n\nTo solve this, we need to determine the rank of the matrix formed by the 501-dimensional vectors. The rank of this matrix is at most 501, and the dimension of the null space (the set of vectors that sum to the all-ones vector) is at least \\(2001 - 501 = 1500\\). This means that there are at least 1500 linearly independent vectors that sum to the all-ones vector.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of flips required to turn all switches on is 1500. This is because we can find 1500 linearly independent 501-dimensional vectors that sum to the all-ones vector, and flipping these vectors will turn all switches on.\n\nThus, the minimum number of minutes required for Elizabeth to escape is \\(\\boxed{1500}\\)."

Since we need all 6 switches to be on, each switch must be flipped an odd number of times. The total number of flips is \\( 3m \\) for some integer \\( m \\) (since 3 switches are flipped each minute). The sum of the number of flips of all switches must be \\( 6 \\times \\text{(odd number)} \\), which is an even number. Therefore, \\( 3m \\) must be even, so \\( m \\) must be even. Let \\( m = 2p \\) for some integer \\( p \\). Then the total number of flips is \\( 6p \\).\n\nWe need to find the smallest \\( p \\) such that it is possible to flip each switch an odd number of times. Let's try \\( p = 1 \\), so \\( m = 2 \\). This means we need 6 flips in total. We need to find a sequence of 2 minutes such that each switch is flipped an odd number of times. One possible sequence is:\n- Minute 1: Flip switches 1, 2, 3\n- Minute 2: Flip switches 1, 4, 5\n\nAfter these 2 minutes, the number of flips for each switch is:\n- Switch 1: 2 (even)\n- Switch 2: 1 (odd)\n- Switch 3: 1 (odd)\n- Switch 4: 1 (odd)\n- Switch 5: 1 (odd)\n- Switch 6: 0 (even)\n\nThis sequence does not work because not all switches are on. We need to try another sequence. Let's try \\( p = 2 \\), so \\( m = 4 \\). This means we need 12 flips in total. We need to find a sequence of 4 minutes such that each switch is flipped an odd number of times. One possible sequence is:\n- Minute 1: Flip switches 1, 2, 3\n- Minute 2: Flip switches 1, 4, 5\n- Minute 3: Flip switches 2, 4, 6\n- Minute 4: Flip switches 3, 5, 6\n\nAfter these 4 minutes, the number of flips for each switch is:\n- Switch 1: 3 (odd)\n- Switch 2: 3 (odd)\n- Switch 3: 3 (odd)\n- Switch 4: 3 (odd)\n- Switch 5: 3 (odd)\n- Switch 6: 3 (odd)\n\nThis sequence works because each switch is flipped an odd number of times. Therefore, \\( E(6,3) = 4 \\).\n\nNow, we can compute \\( I(6,3) \\):\n\\[\nI(6,3) = E(6,3) - \\frac{6}{3} = 4 - 2 = 2\n\\]\n\nThus, the value of \\( I(6,3) \\) is \\(\\boxed{2}\\)."

She is in a room with one door which is locked at the start of the puzzle. The room contains $n$ light switches, each of which is initially off. Each minute, she must flip exactly $k$ different light switches (to \"flip\" a switch means to turn it on if it is currently off, and off if it is currently on). At the end of each minute, if all of the switches are on, then the door unlocks and Elizabeth escapes from the room.\n\nLet $E(n, k)$ be the minimum number of minutes required for Elizabeth to escape, for positive integers $n, k$ with $k \\leq n$. For example, $E(2,1)=2$ because Elizabeth cannot escape in one minute (there are two switches and one must be flipped every minute) but she can escape in two minutes (by flipping Switch 1 in the first minute and Switch 2 in the second minute). Define $E(n, k)=\\infty$ if the puzzle is impossible to solve (that is, if it is impossible to have all switches on at the end of any minute).\n\nFor convenience, assume the $n$ light switches are numbered 1 through $n$.\nOne might guess that in most cases, $E(n, k) \\approx \\frac{n}{k}$. In light of this guess, define the inefficiency of the ordered pair $(n, k)$, denoted $I(n, k)$, as\n\n$$\nI(n, k)=E(n, k)-\\frac{n}{k}\n$$\n\nif $E(n, k) \\neq \\infty$.

            "To solve for \\(\\tan \\angle H A E\\), we need to understand the geometric configuration of the tetrahedra \\(J A N E\\), \\(J O H N\\), and \\(J O A N\\). The key is to recognize that these tetrahedra share the vertex \\(J\\) and that the points \\(A\\), \\(E\\), \\(H\\), and \\(N\\) are distinct and non-overlapping.\n\nFirst, let's place the tetrahedra in a coordinate system for easier calculation. Assume \\(J\\) is at the origin \\((0,0,0)\\), and the other vertices are positioned such that the tetrahedra are regular. For simplicity, we can use the fact that the angle between any two edges meeting at a vertex in a regular tetrahedron is \\(\\arccos\\left(-\\frac{1}{3}\\right)\\).\n\nThe angle \\(\\angle H A E\\) is the angle between the vectors \\(\\overrightarrow{HA}\\) and \\(\\overrightarrow{EA}\\). Since \\(H\\) and \\(N\\) are symmetrically placed with respect to \\(A\\) and \\(E\\) in the plane containing \\(J\\), the angle \\(\\angle H A E\\) is the same as the angle between two edges of a regular tetrahedron meeting at a vertex, which is \\(\\arccos\\left(-\\frac{1}{3}\\right)\\).\n\nThe tangent of this angle can be found using the identity for the tangent of the arccosine function.

            "To solve the problem, we need to determine the product of the digits of all positive integers from 1 to 2019 after removing all occurrences of the digits 0 and 5, and then find the remainder of this product when divided by 1000.\n\nFirst, let's identify the digits that remain after removing 0 and 5. The digits are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9.\n\nNext, we need to count the occurrences of each of these digits in the numbers from 1 to 2019. We will do this by considering the numbers in different ranges: 1 to 999, 1000 to 1999, and 2000 to 2019.\n\n**Counting the digits from 1 to 999:**\n- Each digit (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9) appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) 100 times (since there are 1000 numbers and each digit appears in each position 100 times).\n- Therefore, each digit appears \\(3 \\times 100 = 300\\) times in the numbers from 1 to 999.\n\n**Counting the digits from 1000 to 1999:**\n- The digit 1 appears 1000 times in the thousands place.\n- Each digit (0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9) appears 100 times in the hundreds, tens, and units places.\n- Therefore, each digit appears \\(3 \\times 100 = 300\\) times in the numbers from 1000 to 1999.\n- The digit 0 does not appear in the thousands place, so it does not contribute to the count.\n\n**Counting the digits from 2000 to 2019:**\n- The digit 2 appears 20 times in the thousands place.\n- The digit 0 appears 2 times in the hundreds place.\n- The digit 1 appears 1 time in the units place.\n- The digits 0, 5 do not appear in the hundreds, tens, or units places.\n- Therefore, the digit 2 appears 20 times, the digit 0 appears 2 times, and the digit 1 appears 1 time.\n\nNow, we sum up the counts of each digit:\n- Digit 1: \\(300 + 300 + 20 = 620\\)\n- Digit 2: \\(300 + 20 = 320\\)\n- Digit 3: \\(300\\)\n- Digit 4: \\(300\\)\n- Digit 6: \\(300\\)\n- Digit 7: \\(300\\)\n- Digit 8: \\(300\\)\n- Digit 9: \\(300\\)\n\nThe product of the remaining digits is:\n\\[1^{620} \\times 2^{320} \\times 3^{300} \\times 4^{300} \\times 6^{300} \\times 7^{300} \\times 8^{300} \\times 9^{300}\\]\n\nWe can simplify this product by factoring out the powers of 2 and 5:\n\\[2^{320} \\times (2 \\times 2)^{300} \\times 3^{300} \\times 4^{300} \\times 6^{300} \\times 7^{300} \\times 8^{300} \\times 9^{300} = 2^{320} \\times 2^{300} \\times 3^{300} \\times 2^{600} \\times 6^{300} \\times 7^{300} \\times 8^{300} \\times 9^{300}\\]\n\\[= 2^{620} \\times 3^{300} \\times 2^{600} \\times 6^{300} \\times 7^{300} \\times 8^{300} \\times 9^{300} = 2^{1220} \\times 3^{300} \\times 6^{300} \\times 7^{300} \\times 8^{300} \\times 9^{300}\\]\n\nSince we are interested in the remainder when this product is divided by 1000, we can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem. We need to find the product modulo 8 and modulo 125.\n\n**Modulo 8:**\n\\[2^{1220} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{8}\\]\n\\[3^{300} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{8}\\]\n\\[6^{300} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{8}\\]\n\\[7^{300} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{8}\\]\n\\[8^{300} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{8}\\]\n\\[9^{300} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{8}\\]\n\\[2^{1220} \\times 3^{300} \\times 6^{300} \\times 7^{300} \\times 8^{300} \\times 9^{300} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{8}\\]\n\n**Modulo 125:**\n\\[2^{1220} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{125}\\]\n\\[3^{300} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{125}\\]\n\\[6^{300} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{125}\\]\n\\[7^{300} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{125}\\]\n\\[8^{300} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{125}\\]\n\\[9^{300} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{125}\\]\n\\[2^{1220} \\times 3^{300} \\times 6^{300} \\times 7^{300} \\times 8^{300} \\times 9^{300} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{125}\\]\n\nSince the product is 0 modulo both 8 and 125, it is 0 modulo 1000.

The side length of the cube can be determined by the distance between the given vertices or by the distance between any two vertices that are not on the same face but are diagonally opposite on a face or the space diagonal of the cube.\n\nFirst, we calculate the distance between the points \\((1,2,3)\\) and \\((3,3,2)\\):\n\\[\n\\sqrt{(3-1)^2 + (3-2)^2 + (2-3)^2} = \\sqrt{2^2 + 1^2 + (-1)^2} = \\sqrt{4 + 1 + 1} = \\sqrt{6}.\n\\]\nThis distance is the length of a face diagonal of the cube. If \\(s\\) is the side length of the cube, then the length of the face diagonal is \\(s\\sqrt{2}\\). Therefore, we have:\n\\[\ns\\sqrt{2} = \\sqrt{6} \\implies s = \\sqrt{3}.\n\\]\nThe volume of the cube with side length \\(\\sqrt{3}\\) is:\n\\[\n(\\sqrt{3})^3 = 3\\sqrt{3}.\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to consider if there are any other possible side lengths. The other possible side length of the cube can be derived from the fact that the distance between any two vertices of the cube that are not on the same face but are diagonally opposite on a face or the space diagonal of the cube must also be a valid side length of the cube. However, the only other possible side length would be derived from the space diagonal of the cube, but since we already have the side length from the face diagonal, we do not need to consider it again.\n\nThus, the only possible side length of the cube is \\(\\sqrt{3}\\), and the only possible volume is \\(3\\sqrt{3}\\). The product of all possible distinct volumes of the cube is:\n\\[\n3\\sqrt{3}.\n\\]\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{27}.\n\\]"

            "To solve the problem, we need to determine the minimum number of selfies such that each pair of the eight students appears in exactly one picture. Let's denote the students by \\( S_1, S_2, \\ldots, S_8 \\).\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of pairs of students. The number of ways to choose 2 students out of 8 is given by the binomial coefficient:\n\\[\n\\binom{8}{2} = \\frac{8 \\times 7}{2 \\times 1} = 28\n\\]\nSo, there are 28 pairs of students.\n\nNext, we need to ensure that each of these 28 pairs appears in exactly one picture. Each picture can have either 2 or 3 students. If a picture has 2 students, it contributes 1 pair. If a picture has 3 students, it contributes \\(\\binom{3}{2} = 3\\) pairs.\n\nLet \\( x \\) be the number of pictures with 2 students and \\( y \\) be the number of pictures with 3 students. We need to satisfy the following equations:\n\\[\nx + y = \\text{total number of pictures}\n\\]\n\\[\nx + 3y = 28 \\quad \\text{(since each picture with 2 students contributes 1 pair and each picture with 3 students contributes 3 pairs)}\n\\]\n\nWe can solve these equations step by step. First, we express \\( x \\) in terms of \\( y \\) from the first equation:\n\\[\nx = \\text{total number of pictures} - y\n\\]\n\nSubstitute \\( x \\) into the second equation:\n\\[\n(\\text{total number of pictures} - y) + 3y = 28\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{total number of pictures} + 2y = 28\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{total number of pictures} = 28 - 2y\n\\]\n\nSince the total number of pictures must be a non-negative integer, \\( y \\) must be an integer such that \\( 28 - 2y \\geq 0 \\). This simplifies to:\n\\[\ny \\leq 14\n\\]\n\nTo minimize the total number of pictures, we maximize \\( y \\). The maximum value of \\( y \\) is 14. Substituting \\( y = 14 \\) into the equation for the total number of pictures:\n\\[\n\\text{total number of pictures} = 28 - 2 \\times 14 = 0\n\\]\n\nThis is not possible because we need at least one picture. Therefore, we try the next largest integer for \\( y \\), which is 13:\n\\[\n\\text{total number of pictures} = 28 - 2 \\times 13 = 2\n\\]\n\nThis is also not possible because we need at least 3 pictures to cover all pairs. We try \\( y = 12 \\):\n\\[\n\\text{total number of pictures} = 28 - 2 \\times 12 = 4\n\\]\n\nThis is possible. If we have 4 pictures, we can distribute them as follows:\n- 1 picture with 3 students (3 pairs)\n- 3 pictures with 2 students (3 pairs)\n\nThis gives us a total of 6 pairs, which is more than 28. Therefore, we need to adjust our approach. We try \\( y = 10 \\):\n\\[\n\\text{total number of pictures} = 28 - 2 \\times 10 = 8\n\\]\n\nThis is possible. If we have 8 pictures, we can distribute them as follows:\n- 1 picture with 3 students (3 pairs)\n- 5 pictures with 2 students (5 pairs)\n\nThis gives us a total of 8 pairs, which is more than 28. Therefore, we need to adjust our approach. We try \\( y = 8 \\):\n\\[\n\\text{total number of pictures} = 28 - 2 \\times 8 = 12\n\\]\n\nThis is possible. If we have 12 pictures, we can distribute them as follows:\n- 1 picture with 3 students (3 pairs)\n- 9 pictures with 2 students (9 pairs)\n\nThis gives us a total of 12 pairs, which is more than 28. Therefore, we need to adjust our approach. We try \\( y = 6 \\):\n\\[\n\\text{total number of pictures} = 28 - 2 \\times 6 = 16\n\\]\n\nThis is possible. If we have 16 pictures, we can distribute them as follows:\n- 1 picture with 3 students (3 pairs)\n- 13 pictures with 2 students (13 pairs)\n\nThis gives us a total of 16 pairs, which is more than 28. Therefore, we need to adjust our approach. We try \\( y = 4 \\):\n\\[\n\\text{total number of pictures} = 28 - 2 \\times 4 = 20\n\\]\n\nThis is possible. If we have 20 pictures, we can distribute them as follows:\n- 1 picture with 3 students (3 pairs)\n- 17 pictures with 2 students (17 pairs)\n\nThis gives us a total of 20 pairs, which is more than 28. Therefore, we need to adjust our approach. We try \\( y = 2 \\):\n\\[\n\\text{total number of pictures} = 28 - 2 \\times 2 = 24\n\\]\n\nThis is possible. If we have 24 pictures, we can distribute them as follows:\n- 1 picture with 3 students (3 pairs)\n- 21 pictures with 2 students (21 pairs)\n\nThis gives us a total of 24 pairs, which is more than 28. Therefore, we need to adjust our approach. We try \\( y = 0 \\):\n\\[\n\\text{total number of pictures} = 28 - 2 \\times 0 = 28\n\\]\n\nThis is possible. If we have 28 pictures, we can distribute them as follows:\n- 1 picture with 3 students (3 pairs)\n- 27 pictures with 2 students (27 pairs)\n\nThis gives us a total of 28 pairs, which is exactly 28.

The distance between the centers \\((5, 5)\\) and \\((1, -1)\\) is calculated as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{(5-1)^2 + (5-(-1))^2} = \\sqrt{4^2 + 6^2} = \\sqrt{16 + 36} = \\sqrt{52} = 2\\sqrt{13}\n\\]\n\nFor the circles to intersect at exactly two points, the distance between the centers must be equal to the sum or the difference of their radii. Therefore, we have two cases to consider:\n\n1. \\(2\\sqrt{13} = \\sqrt{K} + \\sqrt{37}\\)\n2. \\(2\\sqrt{13} = \\sqrt{37} - \\sqrt{K}\\)\n\nLet's solve the first case:\n\n\\[\n2\\sqrt{13} = \\sqrt{K} + \\sqrt{37}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\sqrt{K} = 2\\sqrt{13} - \\sqrt{37}\n\\]\n\\[\nK = (2\\sqrt{13} - \\sqrt{37})^2\n\\]\n\\[\nK = 4 \\cdot 13 - 2 \\cdot 2\\sqrt{13} \\cdot \\sqrt{37} + 37\n\\]\n\\[\nK = 52 + 37 - 4\\sqrt{481}\n\\]\n\\[\nK = 89 - 4\\sqrt{481}\n\\]\n\nNow, let's solve the second case:\n\n\\[\n2\\sqrt{13} = \\sqrt{37} - \\sqrt{K}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\sqrt{K} = \\sqrt{37} - 2\\sqrt{13}\n\\]\n\\[\nK = (\\sqrt{37} - 2\\sqrt{13})^2\n\\]\n\\[\nK = 37 - 2 \\cdot \\sqrt{37} \\cdot 2\\sqrt{13} + 4 \\cdot 13\n\\]\n\\[\nK = 37 + 52 - 4\\sqrt{481}\n\\]\n\\[\nK = 89 - 4\\sqrt{481}\n\\]\n\nIn both cases, we get the same value for \\(K\\). Therefore, the greatest real number \\(K\\) for which the graphs of the given equations have exactly two intersection points is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{89 - 4\\sqrt{481}}\n\\]"

            "To transform the sequence \\(1^2, 2^2, 3^2, \\ldots, 10^2\\) into an arithmetic progression, we need to understand the conditions under which an operation (morphism) can be performed. An operation replaces two terms \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) with \\(a+1\\) and \\(b-1\\) if and only if \\(a+1 < b-1\\), which simplifies to \\(a < b-2\\).\n\nFirst, let's write out the initial sequence:\n\\[1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100.\\]\n\nWe need to find an arithmetic progression that these numbers can be transformed into. The arithmetic progression should have a common difference \\(d\\). Let's consider the possible common differences. The smallest possible common difference is 1, but that would require the sequence to be consecutive integers, which is not the case here. The next possible common difference is 3, which is a reasonable guess given the differences between the squares.\n\nLet's try to transform the sequence into an arithmetic progression with a common difference of 3. We need to find a sequence of the form \\(a, a+3, a+6, \\ldots, a+27\\). The sum of the original sequence is:\n\\[1 + 4 + 9 + 16 + 25 + 36 + 49 + 64 + 81 + 100 = 385.\\]\nThe sum of the arithmetic progression with the first term \\(a\\) and common difference 3 is:\n\\[10a + 3(0+1+2+\\cdots+9) = 10a + 3 \\cdot \\frac{9 \\cdot 10}{2} = 10a + 135.\\]\nSetting the sums equal, we get:\n\\[10a + 135 = 385 \\implies 10a = 250 \\implies a = 25.\\]\nSo, the arithmetic progression we want is \\(25, 28, 31, 34, 37, 40, 43, 46, 49, 52\\).\n\nNow, we need to determine the minimum number of operations to transform the original sequence into this arithmetic progression. We can do this by counting the number of operations needed to move each term to its correct position in the arithmetic progression.\n\n1. The term 1 needs to be moved to position 10.\n2. The term 4 needs to be moved to position 9.\n3. The term 9 needs to be moved to position 8.\n4. The term 16 needs to be moved to position 7.\n5. The term 25 needs to be moved to position 6.\n6. The term 36 needs to be moved to position 5.\n7. The term 49 needs to be moved to position 4.\n8. The term 64 needs to be moved to position 3.\n9. The term 81 needs to be moved to position 2.\n10. The term 100 needs to be moved to position 1.\n\nEach term needs to be moved a certain number of positions to its correct position. The number of operations required is the sum of the absolute differences between the positions of each term in the original sequence and its correct position in the arithmetic progression, divided by 2 (since each operation moves two terms).\n\nThe absolute differences are:\n\\[|1-10| + |4-9| + |9-8| + |16-7| + |25-6| + |36-5| + |49-4| + |64-3| + |81-2| + |100-1| = 9 + 5 + 1 + 9 + 19 + 31 + 45 + 61 + 79 + 99 = 350.\\]\nThe number of operations is:\n\\[\\frac{350}{2} = 175.\\]\n\nTherefore, the least number of operations needed to transform the sequence into an arithmetic progression is \\(\\boxed{25}\\)."

            "To solve the equation \\(\\log_{6} \\sqrt{x-7} + \\log_{36} (x-2) = 1\\), we start by using the change of base formula for logarithms. The change of base formula states that \\(\\log_{a} b = \\frac{\\log_{c} b}{\\log_{c} a}\\). Here, we can use the natural logarithm (or any other base) to simplify the equation. However, we can also use the property that \\(\\log_{a^2} b = \\frac{1}{2} \\log_{a} b\\).

            "To find the largest possible sum of the 15 answers in an arithmetic progression with the largest possible difference, we need to maximize the difference between the answers. The answers range from 000 to 999, so the largest possible difference between any two answers is 999.\n\nLet the first term of the arithmetic progression be \\(a\\) and the common difference be \\(d\\). The 15th term of the arithmetic progression can be expressed as \\(a + 14d\\). Since the answers must be within the range 000 to 999, we have:\n\\[0 \\leq a \\leq 999 - 14d.\\]\nTo maximize the sum of the answers, we should choose the largest possible value for \\(d\\). The largest possible value for \\(d\\) is 999, but this would make the 15th term \\(a + 14 \\cdot 999 = a + 13986\\), which is much larger than 999. Therefore, we need to find the largest \\(d\\) such that \\(a + 14d \\leq 999\\).\n\nIf we set \\(d = 999\\), then \\(a + 14 \\cdot 999 = a + 13986 > 999\\), which is not possible. So, we try \\(d = 998\\):\n\\[a + 14 \\cdot 998 = a + 13972 \\leq 999.\\]\nThis is also not possible. We continue this process until we find the largest \\(d\\) that works. If we set \\(d = 64\\):\n\\[a + 14 \\cdot 64 = a + 896 \\leq 999.\\]\nThis gives us:\n\\[a \\leq 999 - 896 = 103.\\]\nSo, the largest possible value for \\(a\\) is 103. Therefore, the arithmetic progression is:\n\\[103, 103+64, 103+2 \\cdot 64, \\ldots, 103+14 \\cdot 64.\\]\nThe sum of an arithmetic progression is given by:\n\\[S = \\frac{n}{2} (2a + (n-1)d),\\]\nwhere \\(n\\) is the number of terms, \\(a\\) is the first term, and \\(d\\) is the common difference. Here, \\(n = 15\\), \\(a = 103\\), and \\(d = 64\\). So, the sum is:\n\\[S = \\frac{15}{2} (2 \\cdot 103 + (15-1) \\cdot 64) = \\frac{15}{2} (206 + 928) = \\frac{15}{2} \\cdot 1134 = 15 \\cdot 567 = 8505.\\]\nThus, the largest possible sum of the 15 answers is:\n\\[\\boxed{8505}.\\]"

These points will give us the endpoints of the segments of the line that lie below the curve.\n\nFirst, we set the equations equal to each other to find the points of intersection:\n\\[ 4x = 10\\pi \\sin^2 x. \\]\nThis equation is transcendental and cannot be solved algebraically, so we need to find the solutions graphically or numerically.

            "To determine the number of noncongruent triangles that can be formed by extending three sides of a regular 16-gon, we need to consider the vertices of the 16-gon and how they can be used to form the triangles.\n\nA regular 16-gon has 16 vertices. When we extend three sides of the 16-gon, we form a triangle by connecting three vertices of the 16-gon such that no two vertices of the triangle are adjacent vertices of the 16-gon. This means that the vertices of the triangle must be separated by at least one vertex of the 16-gon.\n\nWe can represent the vertices of the 16-gon as \\(A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_{16}\\). If we choose three vertices \\(A_i, A_j, A_k\\) to form the triangle, then the condition is that the vertices are not adjacent, i.e., the difference between any two of the indices (considering the indices modulo 16) must be at least 2. This means that if we choose \\(A_i\\), the next vertex we can choose is \\(A_{i+2}\\) or later, and so on.\n\nTo count the number of noncongruent triangles, we need to count the number of distinct sets of three vertices that satisfy this condition. We can use the fact that the 16-gon is regular, so the triangles formed will be congruent if they have the same set of side lengths.\n\nWe can use a combinatorial approach to count the number of ways to choose three vertices from 16 such that no two vertices are adjacent. This is equivalent to choosing 3 vertices from 16-3+1 = 14 vertices (since we are skipping one vertex between each chosen vertex).\n\nThe number of ways to choose 3 vertices from 14 is given by the combination formula \\(\\binom{14}{3}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\binom{14}{3} = \\frac{14 \\times 13 \\times 12}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 364\n\\]\n\nHowever, this counts all possible sets of three vertices, including those where the vertices are adjacent or two vertices are adjacent. We need to subtract the number of sets where the vertices are adjacent or two vertices are adjacent.\n\nThe number of sets where two vertices are adjacent is 16 (since we can choose any of the 16 vertices and the next vertex is fixed, and the third vertex can be any of the remaining 13 vertices, but we need to subtract the cases where the third vertex is adjacent to the first two, which is 2 cases for each pair, so we have 16 * 13 \/ 2 - 16 = 104).\n\nThe number of sets where all three vertices are adjacent is 16 (since we can choose any of the 16 vertices and the next two vertices are fixed, but we need to subtract the cases where the third vertex is adjacent to the first two, which is 1 case for each set of three adjacent vertices, so we have 16 * 1 \/ 2 - 16 = 8).\n\nSo, the number of noncongruent triangles is:\n\n\\[\n364 - 104 - 8 = 252\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of noncongruent triangles that can be formed is \\(\\boxed{56}\\)."

Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, recall the periodicity and symmetry properties of the sine function. The sine function has a period of \\(2\\pi\\), and it is an odd function, meaning \\(\\sin(-x) = -\\sin(x)\\). Additionally, \\(\\sin(x + 2k\\pi) = \\sin(x)\\) for any integer \\(k\\).\n\nWe can simplify \\(\\sin \\frac{(5-T) \\pi}{2}\\) by noting that \\(\\frac{(5-T) \\pi}{2} = 2\\pi + \\frac{(1-T) \\pi}{2}\\). Since \\(\\sin(2\\pi + x) = \\sin(x)\\), we have:\n\\[\n\\sin \\frac{(5-T) \\pi}{2} = \\sin \\left(2\\pi + \\frac{(1-T) \\pi}{2}\\right) = \\sin \\frac{(1-T) \\pi}{2}.\n\\]\nThus, the original expression becomes:\n\\[\n\\sin^2 \\frac{T \\pi}{2} + \\sin^2 \\frac{(1-T) \\pi}{2}.\n\\]\n\nNext, we use the identity \\(\\sin \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} - x\\right) = \\cos x\\). Therefore, \\(\\sin \\frac{(1-T) \\pi}{2} = \\cos \\frac{T \\pi}{2}\\). So the expression now is:\n\\[\n\\sin^2 \\frac{T \\pi}{2} + \\cos^2 \\frac{T \\pi}{2}.\n\\]\n\nWe know from the Pythagorean identity that \\(\\sin^2 x + \\cos^2 x = 1\\) for any angle \\(x\\). Applying this identity, we get:\n\\[\n\\sin^2 \\frac{T \\pi}{2} + \\cos^2 \\frac{T \\pi}{2} = 1.\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the value of the original expression is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{1}.\n\\]"
