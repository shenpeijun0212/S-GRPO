Total internal reflection occurs when a light ray travels from a medium with a higher index of refraction to a medium with a lower index of refraction, and the angle of incidence is greater than the critical angle.\n\nGiven:\n- The index of refraction of the glass \\(n = 1.5\\).\n- The light enters the glass from air, so the index of refraction of air is approximately 1.\n\nThe critical angle \\(\\theta_c\\) is the angle of incidence in the glass for which the angle of refraction is 90 degrees. At this angle, the light is just starting to be internally reflected. Snell's Law states:\n\n\\[ n_1 \\sin \\theta_1 = n_2 \\sin \\theta_2 \\]\n\nwhere \\(n_1\\) is the index of refraction of the first medium (air), \\(\\theta_1\\) is the angle of incidence, \\(n_2\\) is the index of refraction of the second medium (glass), and \\(\\theta_2\\) is the angle of refraction. For the critical angle, \\(\\theta_2 = 90^\\circ\\) and \\(\\sin 90^\\circ = 1\\). Therefore, we have:\n\n\\[ 1 \\cdot \\sin \\theta_c = 1.5 \\cdot \\sin 90^\\circ \\]\n\\[ \\sin \\theta_c = 1.5 \\]\n\nHowever, the sine of an angle cannot be greater than 1. This indicates that total internal reflection does not occur at the hypotenuse \\(H\\) under the given conditions. Instead, we need to find the angle of incidence at the hypotenuse such that the light is internally reflected.\n\nThe angle of incidence at the hypotenuse is the angle between the incident light and the normal to the hypotenuse. Since the light enters the glass from the side \\(L\\) and the hypotenuse \\(H\\) forms a 45-degree angle with the side \\(L\\), the angle of incidence at the hypotenuse is 45 degrees. The critical angle \\(\\theta_c\\) is the angle of incidence in the glass for which the angle of refraction is 90 degrees. Using Snell's Law again:\n\n\\[ 1.5 \\sin \\theta_c = 1 \\sin 90^\\circ \\]\n\\[ \\sin \\theta_c = \\frac{1}{1.5} = \\frac{2}{3} \\]\n\\[ \\theta_c = \\sin^{-1} \\left( \\frac{2}{3} \\right) \\]\n\nUsing a calculator to find the inverse sine:\n\n\\[ \\theta_c \\approx 41.81031489577877^\\circ \\]\n\nRounding to three significant figures, we get:\n\n\\[ \\theta_c \\approx 41.8^\\circ \\]\n\nTherefore, the critical angle for the light to be internally reflected at \\(H\\) is \\(\\boxed{41.8}\\) degrees."

            "To determine the angular resolution of the radio telescoping array, we need to consider the geometry of the dishes and the source. The angular resolution of the array is determined by the smallest angle that can be resolved by any of the dishes when the source is directly overhead.\n\nFirst, let's recall the angular resolution of a single dish. The angular resolution \\(\\theta\\) of a single dish is given by the formula:\n\\[\n\\theta = \\frac{\\lambda}{D}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\lambda\\) is the wavelength of the radio wave and \\(D\\) is the diameter of the dish.

So, the angular resolution of a single dish is:\n\\[\n\\theta = \\frac{0.01 \\text{ m}}{1 \\text{ m}} = 0.01 \\text{ radians}\n\\]\n\nNow, for the array of dishes, the angular resolution of the array is the smallest angle that any of the dishes can resolve. Since the dishes are distributed randomly within a \\(1 \\text{ km} = 1000 \\text{ m}\\) diameter circle, the angular resolution of the array is the same as the angular resolution of a single dish when the source is directly overhead. This is because the smallest angle that any dish can resolve is the same as the angular resolution of a single dish, regardless of the number of dishes or their distribution.\n\nTherefore, the angular resolution of the telescoping array for a source directly overhead is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{0.01}\n\\]"

            "To determine the number of down quarks in a tritium ($H^3$) nucleus, we need to understand the structure of the tritium atom. T[::-3) is an isotope of hydrogen with a atomic number of 1 and a mass number of 3. This means that a tritium atom has 1proton and 2 down quarks in its nucleus.\n\nThe atomic number of an element is the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom of that element. For tritium, the atomic number is 1, so it has 1proton. The mass number of an atom is the sum of the number of protons and the number ofneutrons in the nucleus. For tritium, the mass number is 3, so the number ofneutrons is calculated as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number ofneutrons} = \\text{Mass number} - \\text{Atomic number} = 3 - 1 = 2\n\\]\n\nIn addition to the down quarks, the up quark and the down quark make up the hadrons that make up the atom. The up quark and the down quark are the only types of quarks found in hadrons, and they come in pairs (one up quark and one down quark) for each hadron. Since tritium is a hadron, it must contain one down quark.\n\nTherefore, the number of down quarks in a tritium nucleus is \\boxed{2}."

Substituting this into the formula, we get:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{1 - \\beta}{1 + \\beta}\n\\]\nTo solve for \\(\\beta\\), we can cross-multiply:\n\\[\n1 + \\beta = \\sqrt{2}(1 - \\beta)\n\\]\nExpanding and rearranging terms, we get:\n\\[\n1 + \\beta = \\sqrt{2} - \\sqrt{2}\\beta\n\\]\n\\[\n\\beta + \\sqrt{2}\\beta = \\sqrt{2} - 1\n\\]\n\\[\n\\beta(1 + \\sqrt{2}) = \\sqrt{2} - 1\n\\]\n\\[\n\\beta = \\frac{\\sqrt{2} - 1}{1 + \\sqrt{2}}\n\\]\nTo simplify this expression, we can multiply the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator:\n\\[\n\\beta = \\frac{(\\sqrt{2} - 1)(1 - \\sqrt{2})}{(1 + \\sqrt{2})(1 - \\sqrt{2})} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2} - 2 - 1 + \\sqrt{2}}{1 - 2} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{2} - 3}{-1} = 3 - 2\\sqrt{2}\n\\]\nHowever, we can also recognize that the given solution is \\(\\beta = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\), which is a simpler form. Let's verify this by substituting \\(\\beta = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\) back into the original equation:\n\\[\n\\cos 45^\\circ = \\frac{1 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}}{1 + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}} = \\frac{\\frac{\\sqrt{2} - 1}{\\sqrt{2}}}{\\frac{\\sqrt{2} + 1}{\\sqrt{2}}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2} - 1}{\\sqrt{2} + 1} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{2} - 1}{\\sqrt{2} - 1} = \\frac{(\\sqrt{2} - 1)^2}{2 - 1} = \\frac{2 - 2\\sqrt{2} + 1}{1} = 3 - 2\\sqrt{2}\n\\]\nThis confirms that \\(\\beta = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\) is indeed the correct speed.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the wavelength of light seen by Manny\nThe wavelength of light seen by Manny is given by the Lorentz transformation for the frequency of light. The frequency of light as seen by a moving observer is given by:\n\\[\nf' = f \\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}\n\\]\nwhere \\(f\\) is the frequency of the light as seen by a stationary observer. The wavelength \\(\\lambda\\) is related to the frequency by \\(\\lambda = \\frac{c}{f}\\), so the wavelength seen by the moving observer is:\n\\[\n\\lambda' = \\frac{c}{f'} = \\frac{c}{f \\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}} = \\frac{\\lambda}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}}\n\\]\nSince \\(\\beta = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\), we have:\n\\[\n\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2} = \\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\n\\]\nTherefore, the wavelength seen by Manny is:\n\\[\n\\lambda' = \\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{red}}}{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}} = \\lambda_{\\text{red}} \\sqrt{2}\n\\]\nSo the wavelength of the light seen by Manny is \\(\\boxed{\\lambda_{\\text{red}} \\sqrt{2}}\\)."

            "To determine the net charge of argillic in a solution with a pH of 1.0, we need to understand the properties of argillic and the implications of the pH of the solution.\n\n1. **Identify the nature of argillic**: Aragil is a type of salt, specifically a type of AB salt where A is a cation (such as Na+ or K+) and B is an anion (such as Cl- or Br-). When a salt of this type is dissolved in water, it dissociates into its constituent ions. For example, a simple argument is NaCl, which dissociates into Na+ and Cl- ions.\n\n2. **Understand the effect of pH on the solution**: The pH of a solution indicates the concentration of H+ ions in the solution. A pH of 1.0 means that the solution is basic. In a basic solution, the concentration of OH- ions is greater than the concentration of H+ ions. However, the number of H+ ions and OH- ions that dissociate from the salt will still be equal to the number of H+ ions and OH- ions that were originally in the solution before it was dissolved.\n\n3. **Determine the net charge**: When a salt like argillic is dissolved in water, it dissociates into its constituent ions. The net charge of the solution will be the sum of the charges of all the ions present. Since the number of H+ ions and OH- ions that dissociate from the salt will be equal to the number of H+ ions and OH- ions that were originally in the solution, the net charge of the solution will be zero. This is because the positive charges from the cations will be balanced by the negative charges from the anions.\n\nTherefore, the net charge of argillic in a solution of pH 1.0 is \\(\\boxed{0}\\)."

Since the concentration gradient is the change in concentration per unit distance, and the concentration at the surface is \\(8 \\times 10^{18} \\text{ cm}^{-3}\\) and at the p-n\u7ed3 is 0 (assuming no antium in the p-type material), the concentration gradient is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{dC}{dx} = \\frac{8 \\times 10^{18} \\text{ cm}^{-3} - 0}{3 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ cm}} = \\frac{8 \\times 10^{18}}{3 \\times 10^{-3}} = \\frac{8 \\times 10^{21}}{3} \\text{ cm}^{-4} \\]\n\nNow, we can use Fick's first law to find the diffusivity \\(J\\):\n\n\\[ J = -D \\frac{dC}{dx} = -4.8 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ cm}^2\/\\text{s} \\times \\frac{8 \\times 10^{21}}{3} \\text{ cm}^{-4} = -4.8 \\times 10^{-11} \\times \\frac{8 \\times 10^{21}}{3} = -4.8 \\times \\frac{8}{3} \\times 10^{10} = -12.8 \\times 10^{10} = -1.28 \\times 10^{11} \\text{ cm}^{-2} \\text{s}^{-1} \\]\n\nThe negative sign indicates the direction of diffusivity, but we are only interested in the magnitude. The diffusivity \\(J\\) is the rate of change of concentration per unit time per unit area, so the concentration gradient is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{dC}{dx} = 1.28 \\times 10^{11} \\text{ cm}^{-2} \\text{s}^{-1} \\]\n\nThe concentration gradient is the rate at which the concentration of antium changes with distance, and it is related to the concentration of antium in the bulk material. The concentration of antium in the bulk material is the concentration at the surface minus the product of the diffusivity and the distance:\n\n\\[ C_{\\text{bulk}} = C_{\\text{surface}} - Jx = 8 \\times 10^{18} - 1.28 \\times 10^{11} \\times 3 \\times 10^{-3} = 8 \\times 10^{18} - 3.84 \\times 10^{8} = 8 \\times 10^{18} - 0.0000384 \\times 10^{18} = 7.9999616 \\times 10^{18} \\approx 8.00 \\times 10^{18} \\text{ cm}^{-3} \\]\n\nTherefore, the donor concentration in the bulk germanium is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{8.00 \\times 10^{18}} \\text{ cm}^{-3} \\]"

            "To determine the differences in relative electronegativity \\(\\Delta x\\) in \\(e V\\) for the systems \\({H}-{F}\\) and \\({C}-{F}\\), we need to use the bond energy data provided. The bond energy of a molecule is related to the electronegativity difference between the atoms in the bond. The general relationship is that the bond energy of a bond between two atoms is proportional to the electronegativity difference between the two atoms. Specifically, the bond energy \\(E\\) can be approximated by the equation:\n\n\\[ E \\approx k \\Delta x \\]\n\nwhere \\(k\\) is a proportionality constant. For simplicity, we can use the fact that the bond energy is approximately proportional to the electronegativity difference, and we can use the bond energies directly to find the electronegativity differences.\n\nFirst, let's find the electronegativity difference for the system \\({H}-{F}\\). The bond energy of the \\({H}-{F}\\) bond is 565 kJ\/mol. We need to find the electronegativity difference \\(\\Delta x_{HF}\\) such that:\n\n\\[ 565 \\approx k \\Delta x_{HF} \\]\n\nNext, let's find the electronegativity difference for the system \\({C}-{F}\\). The bond energy of the \\({C}-{F}\\) bond is not directly given, but we can use the bond energy of \\({C}-{C}\\) as a reference. The bond energy of \\({C}-{C}\\) is 335 kJ\/mol, and we can assume that the electronegativity difference for a triple bond (which is similar to a \\({C}-{F}\\) bond in terms of electronegativity difference) is approximately the same as the difference for a double bond (which is similar to a \\({H}-{F}\\) bond). Therefore, we can use the bond energy of \\({H}-{F}\\) to estimate the bond energy of \\({C}-{F}\\). However, since the bond energy of \\({C}-{F}\\) is not given, we will use the fact that the electronegativity difference is proportional to the bond energy. So, we can write:\n\n\\[ \\Delta x_{CF} \\approx \\frac{335}{565} \\times 565 = 335 \\text{ kJ\/mol} \\]\n\nNow, we need to convert the bond energies from kJ\/mol to eV. We know that 1 kJ\/mol is approximately equal to 83.14 eV. Therefore, the bond energy of the \\({H}-{F}\\) bond in eV is:\n\n\\[ 565 \\text{ kJ\/mol} \\times 83.14 \\text{ eV\/kJ\/mol} = 48481.1 \\text{ eV} \\]\n\nAnd the bond energy of the \\({C}-{F}\\) bond in eV is:\n\n\\[ 335 \\text{ kJ\/mol} \\times 83.14 \\text{ eV\/kJ\/mol} = 27811.9 \\text{ eV} \\]\n\nNow, we can find the electronegativity difference \\(\\Delta x_{HF}\\) in eV:\n\n\\[ \\Delta x_{HF} = \\frac{48481.1 \\text{ eV}}{k} \\]\n\nAnd the electronegativity difference \\(\\Delta x_{CF}\\) in eV:\n\n\\[ \\Delta x_{CF} = \\frac{27811.9 \\text{ eV}}{k} \\]\n\nSince we are asked to find the difference in relative electronegativity \\(\\Delta x\\) in eV between the systems \\({H}-{F}\\) and \\({C}-{F}\\):\n\n\\[ \\Delta x = \\Delta x_{HF} - \\Delta x_{CF} = \\frac{48481.1 \\text{ eV}}{k} - \\frac{27811.9 \\text{ eV}}{k} = \\frac{48481.1 - 27811.9}{k} = \\frac{20669.2}{k} \\]\n\nSince \\(k\\) is a proportionality constant and we are not given its value, we can assume that the difference in bond energy is directly proportional to the difference in electronegativity. Therefore, the difference in relative electronegativity \\(\\Delta x\\) in eV is:\n\n\\[ \\Delta x = \\frac{20669.2}{565} = 36.65 \\]\n\nSo, the difference in relative electronegativity \\(\\Delta x\\) in eV for the systems \\({H}-{F}\\) and \\({C}-{F}\\) is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0.10} \\]"

The decay rate of \\(^{14}\\text{C}\\) in living tissue is 15.3 dis integrations per minute per gram of carbon, and the decay rate can be measured to \\(\\pm 0.1\\) dis integrations per minute per gram of carbon.

            "To determine the optimal price of apples in Cambridge, we need to consider the supply and demand for apples. The price that the city should set will be the price at which the quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied.\n\nFirst, let's define the variables and the conditions given in the problem:\n- The local orchard can produce up to 50 apples per day at a constant marginal cost of 25 cents per apple.\n- The store can supply any remaining apples at a constant marginal cost of 75 cents per apple.\n- When the price is 75 cents per apple, the residents of Cambridge buy 150 apples in a day.\n\nLet's denote the price of apples by \\( p \\) cents. The quantity demanded at price \\( p \\) is the sum of the quantity bought from the local orchard and the quantity bought from the store. The quantity bought from the local orchard is the minimum of 50 apples and the quantity that can be sold at the price \\( p \\) at the cost of 25 cents per apple. The quantity bought from the store is the remaining quantity that can be sold at the price \\( p \\) at the cost of 75 cents per apple.\n\nThe quantity demanded at price \\( p \\) is:\n\\[ Q_d = \\min(50, \\frac{p - 25}{25} \\times 50) + \\max(0, \\frac{p - 75}{75} \\times (150 - 50)) \\]\n\nSince the quantity demanded is 150 apples when the price is 75 cents, we can use this information to find the optimal price. When the price is 75 cents, the quantity bought from the local orchard is 50 apples (since the orchard can produce up to 50 apples and the price is above the cost of 25 cents), and the quantity bought from the store is 100 apples (since the total quantity demanded is 150 apples and the orchard provides 50 apples).\n\nThe cost to the store for the 100 apples is:\n\\[ 100 \\times 75 = 7500 \\text{ cents} \\]\n\nThe total cost to the city is the sum of the cost to the orchard and the cost to the store:\n\\[ 50 \\times 25 + 7500 = 1250 + 7500 = 8750 \\text{ cents} \\]\n\nThe total quantity produced is 150 apples, so the price per apple that the city should set is:\n\\[ \\frac{8750}{150} = \\frac{8750}{150} = \\frac{1750}{30} = \\frac{175}{3} \\approx 58.33 \\text{ cents} \\]\n\nTherefore, the optimal price that the city should set is:\n\\[ \\boxed{50} \\]\n\nThis is because the price must be set such that the quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied, and the price of 50 cents is the price at which the quantity demanded is 150 apples, given the supply constraints of the orchard and the store."

This is because at the maximum point of a function, the first derivative is zero.\n\nSo, we have:\n\\[ \\frac{d\\pi(Q)}{dQ} = \\frac{d}{dQ}(P \\cdot Q - C(Q)) = P - \\frac{dC(Q)}{dQ} \\]\n\nSetting the first derivative equal to zero gives us the condition for profit maximization:\n\\[ P - \\frac{dC(Q)}{dQ} = 0 \\]\n\nThe term \\(\\frac{dC(Q)}{dQ}\\) is the marginal cost (MC) of producing the output.

The eigenvalues of the energy eigenfunctions are the eigen energies \\(E_1\\) and \\(E_2\\) respectively.\n\nThe wavefunction \\(\\psi_{1,2}\\) is a linear combination of \\(\\psi_1\\) and \\(\\psi_2\\). When we measure the energy of the particle, the result of the measurement will be one of the eigenvalues of the energy operator, which are \\(E_1\\) and \\(E_2\\). The probability of measuring each eigenvalue is given by the square of the coefficient of the corresponding eigenfunction in the superposition state.\n\nThe coefficient of \\(\\psi_1\\) in \\(\\psi_{1,2}\\) is \\(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\), and the coefficient of \\(\\psi_2\\) in \\(\\psi_{1,2}\\) is \\(\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}}\\). Therefore, the probability of measuring \\(E_1\\) is \\(\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{3}\\), and the probability of measuring \\(E_2\\) is \\(\\left(\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)^2 = \\frac{4}{3}\\).\n\nHowever, the probability of measuring \\(E_2\\) should be normalized to ensure that the sum of the probabilities is 1. The correct probability of measuring \\(E_2\\) is \\(\\frac{4}{3} \\div \\left(\\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{4}{3}\\right) = \\frac{4}{5}\\), and the probability of measuring \\(E_1\\) is \\(\\frac{1}{3} \\div \\left(\\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{4}{3}\\right) = \\frac{1}{5}\\).\n\nThus, the possible results of the measurement are \\(E_1\\) and \\(E_2\\), with the probabilities \\(\\frac{1}{5}\\) and \\(\\frac{4}{5}\\) respectively.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{E_1 \\text{ and } E_2}\n\\]"
