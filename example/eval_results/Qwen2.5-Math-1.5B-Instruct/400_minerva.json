The gravitational acceleration \\( a \\) is the force per unit mass, so we can write:\n\n\\[ a = \\frac{F}{m_2} = G \\frac{m_1}{r^2} \\]\n\nHere, \\( G = 6.674 \\times 10^{-11} \\, \\text{m}^3 \\text{kg}^{-1} \\text{s}^{-2} \\), \\( m_1 = 1.989 \\times 10^{30} \\, \\text{kg} \\) (the mass of the Sun), and \\( r = 1 \\, \\text{AU} = 1.496 \\times 10^{11} \\, \\text{m} \\) (the average distance from the Earth to the Sun).\n\nSubstituting these values into the equation for acceleration, we get:\n\n\\[ a = 6.674 \\times 10^{-11} \\, \\text{m}^3 \\text{kg}^{-1} \\text{s}^{-2} \\times \\frac{1.989 \\times 10^{30} \\, \\text{kg}}{(1.496 \\times 10^{11} \\, \\text{m})^2} \\]\n\nFirst, we calculate the denominator:\n\n\\[ (1.496 \\times 10^{11})^2 = 2.238 \\times 10^{22} \\, \\text{m}^2 \\]\n\nNow, we substitute this back into the equation for \\( a \\):\n\n\\[ a = 6.674 \\times 10^{-11} \\times \\frac{1.989 \\times 10^{30}}{2.238 \\times 10^{22}} \\]\n\nNext, we simplify the fraction:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1.989 \\times 10^{30}}{2.238 \\times 10^{22}} = 0.890 \\times 10^8 = 8.90 \\times 10^7 \\]\n\nSo, the acceleration is:\n\n\\[ a = 6.674 \\times 10^{-11} \\times 8.90 \\times 10^7 = 5.96 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{m\/s}^2 \\]\n\nRounding to one significant figure, we get:\n\n\\[ a \\approx 6.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{m\/s}^2 \\]\n\nTherefore, the gravitational acceleration due to the Sun at the location of the Earth's orbit is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0.006} \\, \\text{m\/s}^2 \\]"

            "To determine the mass of the black hole, we can use the relationship between the orbital period, the orbital radius, and the mass of the black hole. The formula for the orbital period \\(T\\) of a star orbiting a black hole is given by:\n\n\\[ T = 2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{r^3}{GM}} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\(T\\) is the orbital period,\n- \\(r\\) is the orbital radius,\n- \\(G\\) is the gravitational constant,\n- \\(M\\) is the mass of the black hole.\n\nWe need to solve for \\(M\\).

Since 1 second of arc is approximately \\(3.086 \\times 10^{-18}\\) kilometers (the distance to the Sun in kilometers), the orbital radius \\(r\\) is:\n\n\\[ r = 0.12 \\times 3.086 \\times 10^{-18} \\text{ km} = 3.7032 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ km} \\]\n\nNext, we need to convert the distance to the black hole from kiloparsallars to kilometers.

The rotation curve is given by the speed at which a star would orbit in a circular path at a distance \\( r \\) from the center of the galaxy. The centripetal force required for circular motion is provided by the gravitational force.\n\nThe gravitational force on a star of mass \\( m \\) at a distance \\( r \\) from the center of the galaxy is given by:\n\\[\nF_{\\text{ gravitational}} = \\frac{G M(r) m}{r^2},\n\\]\nwhere \\( M(r) \\) is the mass enclosed within radius \\( r \\), and \\( G \\) is the gravitational constant.\n\nFor circular orbits, the centripetal force is:\n\\[\nF_{\\text{centripetal}} = m \\frac{v^2}{r}.\n\\]\nEquating the gravitational force to the centripetal force, we get:\n\\[\nm \\frac{v^2}{r} = \\frac{G M(r) m}{r^2},\n\\]\nwhich simplifies to:\n\\[\nv^2 = \\frac{G M(r)}{r}.\n\\]\nThus, the rotation curve \\( v(r) \\) is:\n\\[\nv(r) = \\sqrt{\\frac{G M(r)}{r}}.\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find the mass enclosed within radius \\( r \\), \\( M(r) \\).

            "To find the mean free path for collisions among stars in the globular star cluster, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine the number of stars in a given volume:**\n   The density of stars is given as \\(10^6 \\text{pc}^{-3}\\). This means there are \\(10^6\\) stars per cubic arc-minute of distance.\n\n2. **Convert the distance from arc minutes to kilometers:**\n   The distance between two adjacent stars can be approximated by the mean free path. First, we need to convert the distance from arc minutes to kilometers. The distance to the Andromorean system (the nearest star to the Earth) is approximately 2.5 million arc minutes. This means the mean free path is the distance between two adjacent stars in the cluster.\n\n3. **Calculate the mean free path:**\n   The mean free path \\(\\lambda\\) is given by the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\lambda = \\frac{1}{\\text{density} \\times \\text{average cross-section}\n   \\]\n   The average cross-section \\(\\sigma\\) for a star is the area of a sphere with the radius of the Sun. The radius of the Sun is approximately \\(7 \\times 10^5 \\text{cm}\\), so the cross-section is:\n   \\[\n   \\sigma = \\pi r^2 = \\pi (7 \\times 10^5 \\text{cm})^2 = 1.54 \\times 10^{12} \\text{cm}^2\n   \\]\n   The density of stars is \\(10^6 \\text{pc}^{-3}\\). We need to convert this density to \\(\\text{cm}^{-3}\\). Since 1 arc minute is approximately \\(1.8 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{cm}\\), the volume of a sphere with a radius of 1 arc minute is:\n   \\[\n   V = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi (1.8 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{cm})^3 = 2.4 \\times 10^{-15} \\text{cm}^3\n   \\]\n   So the density in \\(\\text{cm}^{-3}\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{density} = \\frac{10^6 \\text{stars}}{2.4 \\times 10^{-15} \\text{cm}^3} = 4.17 \\times 10^{20} \\text{stars\/cm}^3\n   \\]\n   Now we can calculate the mean free path:\n   \\[\n   \\lambda = \\frac{1}{\\text{density} \\times \\sigma} = \\frac{1}{4.17 \\times 10^{20} \\text{stars\/cm}^3 \\times 1.54 \\times 10^{12} \\text{cm}^2} = \\frac{1}{6.4 \\times 10^{32} \\text{stars} \\cdot \\text{cm}} = 1.56 \\times 10^{-33} \\text{cm}\n   \\]\n   Since we need to express the answer to a single significant figure, the mean free path is:\n   \\[\n   \\boxed{2 \\times 10^{18} \\text{cm}}\n   \\]"

            "To solve the problems, we need to determine the age of the universe at different points in its history and express these ages in the requested units. Let's go through each subproblem step by step.\n\n### Subproblem 0: Age of our universe when most He nuclei were formed in minutes\n\nThe age of the universe when most hydrogen atoms were formed is approximately 10 minutes. We need to round this to the nearest power of 10. The powers of 10 are 1, 10, 100, 1000, etc. Since 10 minutes is closer to 10 than to 100, we round 10 minutes to the nearest power of 10, which is 10 minutes.\n\nSo, the answer is \\(\\boxed{1}\\) minute.\n\n### Subproblem 1: Age of our universe when hydrogen atoms formed in years\n\nThe age of the universe when hydrogen atoms formed is approximately 13.8 billion years. We need to express this in years. Since 1 billion is equal to \\(10^9\\), 13.8 billion years is \\(13.8 \\times 10^9\\) years. Rounding 13.8 billion to the nearest power of 10, we get 14 billion years, which is \\(14 \\times 10^9\\) years. However, the problem asks for the age in years, so we use the exact value of 13.8 billion years.\n\nSo, the answer is \\(\\boxed{13800000000}\\) years.\n\n### Subproblem 2: Age of our universe today in Gyr\n\nThe age of the universe today is approximately 13.8 billion years. We need to convert this to Gyr (gigayears). Since 1 billion years is equal to \\(10^9\\) years and 1 billion years is equal to 1000 million years, 13.8 billion years is \\(13.8 \\times 10^9\\) years, which is \\(13.8 \\times 10^9 \/ 10^9 = 13.8\\) Gyr.\n\nSo, the answer is \\(\\boxed{13.8}\\) Gyr."

Since the ver non is at rest in the rest frame of thekaon, its spatial part of the four-momentum vector is zero, and its energy is simply its rest mass energy, which is zero.

            "To determine the net charge of argle in a solution with a pH of 1.0, we need to understand the properties of argle and the implications of the pH value.\n\n1. **Identify the nature of argle**: Arctan (or argon) is a gas with a high dielectricity and a high polarizing power. However, it does not have a net charge in the context of solution chemistry. When we talk about the charge of argle in a solution, we are usually referring to the charge of the ions that make up the argle compound, if any.\n\n2. **Understand the pH value**: A pH of 1.0 means that the solution is basic. basic solutions have a higher concentration of hydroxide ions (OH-) than hydrogen ions (H+). The pH scale is logarithmic, so a pH of 1.0 means that the concentration of OH- ions is 10 times the concentration of H+ ions.\n\n3. **Determine the charge of the ions**: In a solution, the net charge is determined by the sum of the charges of all the ions present. If we assume that argle is composed of ions (which is not the case for argon gas, but we are considering the ions that would be present if it were a solution of ions), the net charge would be the sum of the charges of these ions.\n\n4. **Calculate the net charge**: Since argon is a neutral gas and does not form ions in solution, the net charge of argon in a solution is zero.

For simplicity, let's assume that argon is a salt of a base and an acid, such as NaAr (sodium argon). In this case, the net charge would be determined by the charges of the ions Na+ and Ar-.\n\n   - The charge of Na+ is +1.\n   - The charge of Ar- is -1 (since argon is a neutral gas, it does not have a net charge in solution).\n\n   Therefore, the net charge of the argon salt NaAr in solution is +1 - 1 = 0.\n\nSince the problem does not specify the exact nature of the argon in the solution, we can assume that the net charge of argon in a solution of pH 1.0 is zero.\n\nThus, the net charge of argon in a solution of pH 1.0 is \\boxed{0}."

The unbalanced equation is:\n\n\\[ \\mathrm{CO} + \\mathrm{O}_2 \\rightarrow \\mathrm{CO}_2 \\]\n\n### Step 1: balance the carbon atoms\nThere is one carbon atom in CO and one carbon atom in CO\u2082. So, the carbon atoms are already balanced.\n\n### Step 2: balance the oxygen atoms\nThere is one oxygen atom in O\u2082 and two oxygen atoms in CO\u2082. To balance the oxygen atoms, we need to have two O\u2082 molecules on the left side of the equation. This gives us:\n\n\\[ \\mathrm{CO} + 2\\mathrm{O}_2 \\rightarrow \\mathrm{CO}_2 \\]\n\nNow, let's check the oxygen atoms again:\n- On the left side, we have 1 oxygen atom from CO and 2 oxygen atoms from 2 O\u2082, which totals to 5 oxygen atoms.\n- On the right side, we have 2 oxygen atoms in CO\u2082.\n\nThe equation is not balanced yet because we have 5 oxygen atoms on the left and only 2 on the right.

            "To determine the angle \\(\\theta\\) of the 4th reflection in afiffration experiment, we need to use the Bragg's law, which relates the angle of incidence to the diffraction angle and the spacing of the planes in the sample. Bragg's law is given by:\n\n\\[ n\\lambda = 2d \\sin \\theta \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( n \\) is the order of the reflection (in this case, \\( n = 4 \\)),\n- \\( \\lambda \\) is the wavelength of the X-ray,\n- \\( d \\) is the spacing between the planes in the sample,\n- \\( \\theta \\) is the angle of incidence (which is the same as the angle of reflection for diffraction experiments).\n\nForth, we need to know the wavelength of the W alpha X-ray and the spacing between the planes in the Th sample. However, since these values are not provided in the problem, we will assume typical values for the sake of this calculation. The wavelength of W alpha X-ray is approximately 0.713458888888889 \\(\\text{nm}\\) (or 0.713458888888889 \\(\\text{pm}\\)) and the spacing between the planes in the Th sample is approximately 0.254 \\(\\text{pm}\\) (this is a typical value for the Th sample).\n\nUsing these values, we can substitute into Bragg's law:\n\n\\[ 4 \\times 0.713458888888889 \\text{ pm} = 2 \\times 0.254 \\text{ pm} \\times \\sin \\theta \\]\n\nSimplifying the left side:\n\n\\[ 2.853835555555556 \\text{ pm} = 0.508 \\text{ pm} \\times \\sin \\theta \\]\n\nSolving for \\(\\sin \\theta\\):\n\n\\[ \\sin \\theta = \\frac{2.853835555555556 \\text{ pm}}{0.508 \\text{ pm}} \\approx 5.625 \\]\n\nHowever, this value is not possible for \\(\\sin \\theta\\) because the sine of an angle cannot be greater than 1. This indicates that the given values for the wavelength and the plane spacing are not consistent with the diffraction experiment. In a real experiment, the wavelength and the plane spacing would be such that the sine of the angle is less than or equal to 1. \n\nGiven the typical values and the fact that the calculation resulted in an impossible value, we should re-evaluate the problem with realistic values. If we assume the correct values and solve again, we would get a valid angle. For the sake of this problem, let's assume the correct values and solve for a realistic scenario.\n\nIf we assume the correct values and solve for a realistic scenario, we would get:\n\n\\[ \\sin \\theta = \\frac{4 \\times 0.713458888888889 \\text{ pm}}{2 \\times 0.254 \\text{ pm}} \\approx 5.625 \\]\n\nSince this is not possible, we need to re-evaluate the problem with realistic values.

So, the answer is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1} \\]\n\n**Subproblem 3: If 32.0 g of oxygen react with CO to form carbon dioxide (CO\u2082), how much CO was consumed in this reaction (to 1 decimal place)?**\n\nFirst, we need to determine how many moles of O\u2082 are in 32.0 g. The molar mass of O\u2082 is 32.0 g\/mol. So, the number of moles of O\u2082 is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Moles of O}_2 = \\frac{32.0 \\text{ g}}{32.0 \\text{ g\/mol}} = 1 \\text{ mol} \\]\n\nFrom the balanced equation \\(2\\text{CO} + \\text{O}_2 \\rightarrow 2\\text{CO}_2\\), we see that 1 mole of O\u2082 reacts with 2 moles of CO. Therefore, if 1 mole of O\u2082 reacts, then 2 moles of CO react. The molar mass of CO is 28.0 g\/mol. So, the mass of CO that reacts is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Mass of CO} = 2 \\text{ mol} \\times 28.0 \\text{ g\/mol} = 56.0 \\text{ g} \\]\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{56.0} \\]"

The volume \\(V\\) of one mole of nickel can be calculated using the density \\(\\rho\\) and the molar mass \\(M\\):\n\n\\[ V = \\frac{M}{\\rho} = \\frac{58.69 \\text{ g\/mol}}{8.83 \\text{ g\/cm}^3} \\approx 6.64 \\text{ cm}^3\/\\text{mol} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find the volume of one nickel atom. Since one mole of nickel contains \\(6.022 \\times 10^{23}\\) atoms, the volume of one atom \\(V_{\\text{ atom}}\\) is:\n\n\\[ V_{\\text{ atom}} = \\frac{6.64 \\text{ cm}^3\/\\text{mol}}{6.022 \\times 10^{23} \\text{ atoms\/mol}} \\approx 1.10 \\times 10^{-23} \\text{ cm}^3\/\\text{ atom} \\]\n\nThe volume of a sphere is given by \\(V = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi r^3\\), where \\(r\\) is the atomic radius. Solving for \\(r\\):\n\n\\[ r^3 = \\frac{3V_{\\text{ atom}}}{4\\pi} = \\frac{3 \\times 1.10 \\times 10^{-23} \\text{ cm}^3}{4 \\times 3.14159} \\approx 2.75 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ cm}^3 \\]\n\\[ r \\approx \\sqrt[3]{2.75 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ cm}^3} \\approx 1.40 \\times 10^{-8} \\text{ cm} \\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the second_nearest neighbor distance\n\nThe second_nearest neighbor distance in a face-centered cubic (FCC) structure is equal to the edge length of the cube times \\(\\sqrt{2}\/2\\). In an cubic close packing (CCP), the second_nearest neighbor distance is equal to the edge length of the cube, which is equal to twice the atomic radius.\n\nThe edge length \\(a\\) of the cube in a cubic close packing is equal to twice the atomic radius:\n\n\\[ a = 2r = 2 \\times 1.40 \\times 10^{-8} \\text{ cm} = 2.80 \\times 10^{-8} \\text{ cm} \\]\n\nThe second_nearest neighbor distance is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Second_nearest neighbor distance} = \\frac{a\\sqrt{2}}{2} = \\frac{2.80 \\times 10^{-8} \\text{ cm} \\times \\sqrt{2}}{2} \\approx 1.98 \\times 10^{-8} \\text{ cm} \\]\n\nTo convert this distance topm (1 pm = \\(10^{-12} \\text{ cm}\\)):\n\n\\[ 1.98 \\times 10^{-8} \\text{ cm} = 1.98 \\times 10^{-8} \\times 10^{12} \\text{ pm} = 198000 \\text{ pm} = 1.98 \\times 10^5 \\text{ pm} \\]\n\nThus, the second_nearest neighbor distance for nickel at \\(100^\\circ \\text{C}\\) is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1.98 \\times 10^5} \\]"

            "To determine the acceleration potential \\( V \\) required to cause electron diffraction on the \\(\\{220\\}\\) planes of gold at an angle \\(\\theta = 5^\\circ\\), we need to use the de Broglie hypothesis and the diffraction condition for electrons. The de Broglie hypothesis states that the wavelength \\(\\lambda\\) of a particle is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\lambda = \\frac{h}{p}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(h\\) is Planck's constant and \\(p\\) is the momentum of the particle. The momentum \\(p\\) of an electron can be expressed in terms of its velocity \\(v\\) and mass \\(m\\) as:\n\n\\[\np = \\gamma m v = \\frac{m v}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\gamma\\) is the Lorentz factor, \\(m\\) is the rest mass of the electron, and \\(c\\) is the speed of light. The de Broglie wavelength can also be related to the diffraction condition for electrons. For diffraction on a plane with spacing \\(d\\), the condition is:\n\n\\[\nn \\lambda = 2 d \\sin \\theta\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(n\\) is an integer ( often taken as 1 for the first order diffraction), \\(d\\) is the spacing of the planes, and \\(\\theta\\) is the angle of incidence.

First, we convert 28.1 degrees to radians:\n\n\\[ 28.1^\\circ \\times \\frac{\\pi}{180} \\approx 0.490 \\, \\text{radians} \\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ \\sin^2 28.1^\\circ \\approx 0.490^2 = 0.2401 \\]\n\nNow we substitute this value into the equation:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{\\lambda} = \\frac{2 \\times 6.626 \\times 10^{-34}}{9.109 \\times 10^{-31} \\times (1.602 \\times 10^{-19})^2} \\left( \\frac{1}{0.2401} - 1 \\right) \\]\n\nCalculate the term inside the parentheses:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{0.2401} \\approx 4.165 \\]\n\\[ \\frac{1}{0.2401} - 1 \\approx 4.165 - 1 = 3.165 \\]\n\nNow substitute this back into the equation:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{\\lambda} = \\frac{2 \\times 6.626 \\times 10^{-34}}{9.109 \\times 10^{-31} \\times (1.602 \\times 10^{-19})^2} \\times 3.165 \\]\n\nCalculate the denominator:\n\n\\[ 9.109 \\times 10^{-31} \\times (1.602 \\times 10^{-19})^2 = 9.109 \\times 10^{-31} \\times 2.566 \\times 10^{-38} = 2.334 \\times 10^{-68} \\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{\\lambda} = \\frac{2 \\times 6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\times 3.165}{2.334 \\times 10^{-68}} = \\frac{41.14 \\times 10^{-34}}{2.334 \\times 10^{-68}} = 17.64 \\times 10^{34} = 1.764 \\times 10^{35} \\]\n\nTherefore, the wavelength of the \\(\\lambda_{K_{\\alpha}}\\) line for molybdenum is:\n\n\\[ \\lambda = \\frac{1}{1.764 \\times 10^{35}} = 5.67 \\times 10^{-36} \\, \\text{m} \\]\n\nSo the answer is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5.67 \\times 10^{-10}} \\]"

            "To calculate the planar packing fraction of the (110) plane for aluminum at 300 K, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the lattice parameter of aluminum.\n2. Determine the number of atoms in the (110) plane.\n3. Determine the area of the (110) plane.\n4. Determine the area occupied by the atoms in the (110) plane.\n5. Calculate the planar packing fraction.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the lattice parameter of aluminum\nThe lattice parameter of aluminum (Al) is approximately \\( a = 4.04 \\) Angstrons.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the number of atoms in the (110) plane\nThe (110) plane in a cubic lattice of aluminum has a unit cell that is a rectangle with a length of \\( a \\) and a width of \\( a \\), and it contains 2 atoms. This is because the (110) plane intersects the lattice along the [110] direction, and it contains one atom at each of the two lattice points it passes through.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the area of the (110) plane\nThe area of the (110) plane is the area of the rectangle formed by the lattice vectors in the plane. The area is given by:\n\\[ \\text{Area of the (110) plane} = a \\times \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{a^2}{\\sqrt{2}} \\]\nSubstituting the value of \\( a \\):\n\\[ \\text{Area of the (110) plane} = \\frac{(4.04)^2}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{16.3216}{1.414} \\approx 11.587 \\text{ square Angstrons} \\]\n\n### Step 4: Determine the area occupied by the atoms in the (110) plane\nEach atom in the (110) plane is a sphere with a diameter equal to the lattice parameter \\( a \\), so the radius of each atom is \\( \\frac{a}{2} \\). The area occupied by one atom is the area of a circle with radius \\( \\frac{a}{2} \\):\n\\[ \\text{Area of one atom} = \\pi \\left( \\frac{a}{2} \\right)^2 = \\pi \\left( \\frac{4.04}{2} \\right)^2 = \\pi (2.02)^2 = 4.0804 \\pi \\approx 12.845 \\text{ square Angstrons} \\]\nSince there are 2 atoms in the (110) plane, the total area occupied by the atoms is:\n\\[ \\text{Area occupied by the atoms} = 2 \\times 4.0804 \\pi \\approx 2 \\times 12.845 = 25.690 \\text{ square Angstrons} \\]\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the planar packing fraction\nThe planar packing fraction is the ratio of the area occupied by the atoms to the area of the (110) plane:\n\\[ \\text{Planar packing fraction} = \\frac{\\text{Area occupied by the atoms}}{\\text{Area of the (110) plane}} = \\frac{25.690}{11.587} \\approx 2.203 \\]\nHowever, this value seems incorrect because it is greater than 1. Let's re-evaluate the area of the atoms. The correct area of one atom is:\n\\[ \\text{Area of one atom} = \\pi \\left( \\frac{a}{2} \\right)^2 = \\pi \\left( \\frac{4.04}{2} \\right)^2 = \\pi (2.02)^2 = 4.0804 \\pi \\approx 12.845 \\text{ square Angstrons} \\]\nSince there are 2 atoms in the (110) plane, the total area occupied by the atoms is:\n\\[ \\text{Area occupied by the atoms} = 2 \\times \\frac{4.0804 \\pi}{2} = 4.0804 \\pi \\approx 12.845 \\text{ square Angstrons} \\]\nThe correct planar packing fraction is:\n\\[ \\text{Planar packing fraction} = \\frac{4.0804 \\pi}{11.587} \\approx 1.113 \\]\nThe correct value should be:\n\\[ \\text{Planar packing fraction} = \\frac{2 \\times \\frac{4.0804 \\pi}{2}}{11.587} = \\frac{4.0804 \\pi}{11.587} \\approx 0.856 \\]\n\nSo, the planar packing fraction of the (110) plane for aluminum at 300 K is:\n\\[ \\boxed{0.740} \\]"

            "To determine the differences in relative electronegativity \\(\\Delta x\\) in \\(e V\\) for the systems \\({H}-{F}\\) and \\({C}-{F}\\), we need to use the bond energy data provided. The bond energy of a molecule is related to the electronegativity difference between the atoms in the bond. The general relationship is that the bond energy of a bond between two atoms is proportional to the electronegativity difference between the two atoms. Specifically, the bond energy \\(E\\) can be approximated by the formula:\n\n\\[ E \\approx k \\Delta x \\]\n\nwhere \\(k\\) is a proportionality constant. For simplicity, we can use the fact that the bond energy is approximately proportional to the electronegativity difference, and we can use the bond energies directly to find the electronegativity differences.\n\nFirst, let's find the electronegativity difference for the system \\({H}-{F}\\). The bond energy of the \\({H}-{F}\\) bond is 565 kJ\/mol. We need to find the electronegativity difference \\(\\Delta x_{HF}\\) between hydrogen and flourine. We can use the bond energy of the \\({F}_{2}\\) molecule, which is 172 kJ\/mol, as a reference. The bond energy of a molecule is proportional to the electronegativity difference between the atoms in the bond. Therefore, we can write:\n\n\\[ \\Delta x_{HF} \\approx \\frac{565}{172} \\times \\Delta x_{F} \\]\n\nwhere \\(\\Delta x_{F}\\) is the electronegativity difference between two hydrogen atoms. However, we can also use the fact that the bond energy of a molecule is proportional to the electronegativity difference between the atoms in the bond. Therefore, we can write:\n\n\\[ \\Delta x_{HF} \\approx \\frac{565}{172} \\times \\Delta x_{F} \\]\n\nSince the electronegativity of hydrogen is approximately 2.20 eV and the electronegativity of flourine is approximately 3.98 eV, the electronegativity difference \\(\\Delta x_{F}\\) is:\n\n\\[ \\Delta x_{F} = 3.98 - 2.20 = 1.78 \\text{ eV} \\]\n\nTherefore, the electronegativity difference \\(\\Delta x_{HF}\\) is:\n\n\\[ \\Delta x_{HF} \\approx \\frac{565}{172} \\times 1.78 = 5.99 \\text{ eV} \\]\n\nNext, let's find the electronegativity difference for the system \\({C}-{F}\\). The bond energy of the \\({C}-{F}\\) bond is 590 kJ\/mol. We need to find the electronegativity difference \\(\\Delta x_{CF}\\) between carbon and flourine. We can use the bond energy of the \\({C}-{H}\\) bond, which is 410 kJ\/mol, as a reference. The bond energy of a molecule is proportional to the electronegativity difference between the atoms in the bond. Therefore, we can write:\n\n\\[ \\Delta x_{CF} \\approx \\frac{590}{410} \\times \\Delta x_{C} \\]\n\nwhere \\(\\Delta x_{C}\\) is the electronegativity difference between two carbon atoms. However, we can also use the fact that the bond energy of a molecule is proportional to the electronegativity difference between the atoms in the bond. Therefore, we can write:\n\n\\[ \\Delta x_{CF} \\approx \\frac{590}{410} \\times \\Delta x_{C} \\]\n\nSince the electronegativity of carbon is approximately 2.55 eV and the electronegativity of flourine is approximately 3.98 eV, the electronegativity difference \\(\\Delta x_{C}\\) is:\n\n\\[ \\Delta x_{C} = 3.98 - 2.55 = 1.43 \\text{ eV} \\]\n\nTherefore, the electronegativity difference \\(\\Delta x_{CF}\\) is:\n\n\\[ \\Delta x_{CF} \\approx \\frac{590}{410} \\times 1.43 = 2.00 \\text{ eV} \\]\n\nFinally, the difference in relative electronegativity \\(\\Delta x\\) between the systems \\({H}-{F}\\) and \\({C}-{F}\\) is:\n\n\\[ \\Delta x = \\Delta x_{HF} - \\Delta x_{CF} = 5.99 - 2.00 = 3.99 \\text{ eV} \\]\n\nTherefore, the difference in relative electronegativity is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3.99} \\]"

The total demand for apples in a day is 150 apples when the price is 75 cents per apple.\n\nLet's denote the price of apples by \\( p \\) cents.

            "To determine the algebraic condition that describes a firm that is at an output level that maximizes its profits given its capital in the short-term, we need to use some basic principles of microeconometry, particularly the concept of profit maximization.\n\n1. **Define the profit function**: The profit function for a firm is given by the difference between its total revenue (TR) and its total cost (TC). If we denote the output level by \\( Q \\), the profit function can be written as:\n   \\[\n   \\pi(Q) = TR(Q) - TC(Q)\n   \\]\n   where \\( TR(Q) \\) is the total revenue as a function of output \\( Q \\), and \\( TC(Q) \\) is the total cost as a function of output \\( Q \\).\n\n2. **First-order condition for profit maximization**: To find the output level that maximizes profit, we need to take the derivative of the profit function with respect to \\( Q \\) and set it equal to zero. This is because at the maximum point, the slope of the profit function (which is the derivative of profit with respect to output) is zero. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d\\pi(Q)}{dQ} = \\frac{dTR(Q)}{dQ} - \\frac{dTC(Q)}{dQ} = 0\n   \\]\n   The derivative of total revenue with respect to output is the price (P) at which the output is sold, and the derivative of total cost with respect to output is the marginal cost (MC). Therefore, the first-order condition for profit maximization can be written as:\n   \\[\n   P(Q) - MC(Q) = 0\n   \\]\n   or simply,\n   \\[\n   P(Q) = MC(Q)\n   \\]\n   This condition states that the price at which the firm sells its output is equal to the marginal cost of producing that output. This is the condition that must be satisfied for a firm to be at an output level that maximizes its profits.\n\n3. **Use standard acronym**: The standard acronym for \"marginal cost\" is \"MC\". Therefore, the algebraic condition that describes a firm that is at an output level that maximizes its profits, given its capital in the short-term, is:\n   \\[\n   \\boxed{P = MC}\n   \\]"

For benzene, the molecular orbitals can be described as follows:\n\n1. A symmetric pi molecular orbital (1s) that is higher in energy than the other pi molecular orbitals.\n2. Three degenerate pi molecular orbitals (2p) that are lower in energy than the 1s molecular orbital.\n3. A non-bonding molecular orbital (1s) that is lower in energy than the other pi molecular orbitals.\n\nThe energy of the molecular orbitals can be estimated using the given values of \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\).

            "To obtain the short-run industry supply function for widgets, we need to determine the supply function for a single firm and then extend it to the entire industry.\n\n1. **Determine the supply function for a single firm:**\n   The cost function for a single firm is given by:\n   \\[\n   c_s(y) = \\frac{1}{3} y^3 + 2\n   \\]\n   The average cost (AC) for a single firm is:\n   \\[\n   AC(y) = \\frac{c_s(y)}{y} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{3} y^3 + 2}{y} = \\frac{1}{3} y^2 + \\frac{2}{y}\n   \\]\n   In a competitive market, each firm will produce at the level where price equals the average cost (P = AC). Therefore, the supply function for a single firm is:\n   \\[\n   p = \\frac{1}{3} y^2 + \\frac{2}{y}\n   \\]\n   To find the quantity supplied by a single firm, we need to solve this equation for \\(y\\). However, solving this equation explicitly for \\(y\\) in terms of \\(p\\) is not straightforward, so we will use the relationship between price and quantity supplied by a single firm to find the industry supply function.\n\n2. **Determine the industry supply function:**\n   The industry supply function is the sum of the supply functions of all the individual firms. Since there are 100 identical_firms, the industry supply function is:\n   \\[\n   y_s(p) = 100 \\cdot y_s^{\\text{single firm}}(p)\n   \\]\n   where \\(y_s^{\\text{single firm}}(p)\\) is the quantity supplied by a single firm at price \\(p\\). From the previous step, we know that:\n   \\[\n   p = \\frac{1}{3} y^2 + \\frac{2}{y}\n   \\]\n   This equation is not easily solvable for \\(y\\) in a closed form, but we can express the industry supply function in terms of the individual firm's supply function. Since the individual firm's supply function is \\(y_s^{\\text{single firm}}(p)\\), the industry supply function is:\n   \\[\n   y_s(p) = 100 \\cdot y_s^{\\text{single firm}}(p)\n   \\]\n   However, without an explicit solution for \\(y_s^{\\text{single firm}}(p)\\), we can only express the industry supply function in terms of the individual firm's supply function. The exact form of the industry supply function in terms of \\(p\\) would require solving the equation \\(p = \\frac{1}{3} y^2 + \\frac{2}{y}\\) for \\(y\\), which is not easily done algebraically.\n\nTherefore, the short-run industry supply function for widgets is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{y_s(p) = 100 \\cdot y_s^{\\text{single firm}}(p)}\n\\]\nwhere \\(y_s^{\\text{single firm}}(p)\\) is the quantity supplied by a single firm at price \\(p\\), which satisfies the equation \\(p = \\frac{1}{3} y^2 + \\frac{2}{y}\\)."

Therefore, the probability of measuring \\(E_1\\) is \\(\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{3}\\), and the probability of measuring \\(E_2\\) is \\(\\left(\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)^2 = \\frac{4}{3}\\).\n\nHowever, the probability of measuring \\(E_2\\) should be normalized to ensure that the sum of the probabilities is 1. The correct probability of measuring \\(E_2\\) is \\(\\frac{4}{3} \\div \\left(\\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{4}{3}\\right) = \\frac{4}{5}\\), and the probability of measuring \\(E_1\\) is \\(\\frac{1}{3} \\div \\left(\\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{4}{3}\\right) = \\frac{1}{5}\\).\n\nThus, the possible results of the measurement are \\(E_1\\) and \\(E_2\\), with the probabilities of \\(\\frac{1}{5}\\) and \\(\\frac{4}{5}\\) respectively.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{E_1 \\text{ and } E_2}\n\\]"
