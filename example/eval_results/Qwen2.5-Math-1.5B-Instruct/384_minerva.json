This involves the concept of the critical angle, which is the angle of incidence in the water for which the angle of refraction in the air is 90 degrees. If the angle of incidence is greater than the critical angle, the light will be total internal reflection and will not exit the water.\n\n### Subproblem 0: Finding the angle of the light once it exits the water into the air, \\(\\theta_a\\), in terms of \\(\\theta_w\\)\n\nWe use Snell's law, which states that the ratio of the sine of the angle of incidence to the sine of the angle of refraction is equal to the ratio of the indices of refraction of the two media. Here, the light is incident on the water surface from air, and it exits into the air. The index of refraction of air is approximately 1, and the index of refraction of water is 1.3. Therefore, Snell's law can be written as:\n\n\\[ 1 \\cdot \\sin \\theta_w = 1.3 \\cdot \\sin \\theta_a \\]\n\nSolving for \\(\\theta_a\\), we get:\n\n\\[ \\sin \\theta_a = \\frac{\\sin \\theta_w}{1.3} \\]\n\nThus, the angle \\(\\theta_a\\) is:\n\n\\[ \\theta_a = \\arcsin \\left( \\frac{\\sin \\theta_w}{1.3} \\right) \\]\n\nSo the expression for \\(\\theta_a\\) in terms of \\(\\theta_w\\) is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\arcsin \\left( \\frac{\\sin \\theta_w}{1.3} \\right)} \\]\n\n### Subproblem 1: Finding the critical angle\n\nThe critical angle is the angle of incidence in the water for which the angle of refraction in the air is 90 degrees. At this angle, the light is just starting to total internal reflection. Using Snell's law again, we have:\n\n\\[ 1 \\cdot \\sin \\theta_c = 1.3 \\cdot \\sin 90^\\circ \\]\n\nSince \\(\\sin 90^\\circ = 1\\), we get:\n\n\\[ \\sin \\theta_c = 1.3 \\]\n\nHowever, the sine of an angle cannot be greater than 1. Therefore, the critical angle \\(\\theta_c\\) is the angle whose sine is the maximum possible value, which is 1. This means:\n\n\\[ \\sin \\theta_c = 1 \\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ \\theta_c = \\arcsin(1) \\]\n\nBut since \\(\\sin \\theta_c = \\frac{1}{1.3}\\), we have:\n\n\\[ \\theta_c = \\arcsin \\left( \\frac{1}{1.3} \\right) \\]\n\nThus, the critical angle is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\arcsin \\left( \\frac{1}{1.3} \\right)} \\]"

            "To determine the combined magnitude of the star cluster, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the absolute magnitude of the stars**: The absolute magnitude of each star in the cluster is +5, which means each star has the same magnitude as the Sun when observed from a distance of 10 paces (10 arcseconds).\n\n2. **Convert the distance to a more useful unit**: The distance to the star cluster is given as 10 arcseconds, which is equivalent to 10 paces. This distance is very close to the distance at which the magnitude of a star is defined, so we can use the formula for the magnitude of a point source of light at a distance \\(d\\).\n\n3. **Calculate the magnitude of one star at the distance of the cluster**: The magnitude \\(m\\) of a star at a distance \\(d\\) can be calculated using the formula:\n   \\[\n   m = M + 5 \\log_{10} \\left( \\frac{d}{10 \\text{ arcseconds}} \\right)\n   \\]\n   where \\(M\\) is the absolute magnitude of the star.

Instead, we need to use the formula for the magnitude of a point source of light at a distance \\(d\\), but in a different way. The magnitude of a star cluster can be approximated by the magnitude of a single star at a distance equal to the distance to the cluster, but with a different total number of stars. However, for a large number of stars, the total magnitude is approximately the magnitude of one star multiplied by the number of stars, minus a small correction term that depends on the number of stars and the distance. For simplicity, we can use the approximation that the total magnitude is the magnitude of one star multiplied by the number of stars, because the correction term is very small for a large number of stars.\n\n   Therefore, the total magnitude of the cluster is:\n   \\[\n   M_{\\text{total}} = 10^6 \\times 5 = 5 \\times 10^6\n   \\]\n\nSo, the combined magnitude of the star cluster is \\(\\boxed{-6}\\)."

            "To determine how the radius \\( R \\) of a star depends on its mass \\( M \\) for a star supported by degenerate electron pressure, we start with the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium:\n\\[\n\\frac{dP}{dr} = -\\frac{GM\\rho}{r}\n\\]\nwhere \\( P \\) is the pressure, \\( r \\) is the radial distance from the center of the star, \\( G \\) is the gravitational constant, \\( M \\) is the mass of the star, and \\( \\rho \\) is the mass density.

The characteristic equation for this differential equation is:\n\\[\nr^2 - a^2 = 0.\n\\]\nSolving for \\(r\\), we get:\n\\[\nr^2 = a^2 \\implies r = \\pm a.\n\\]\nThus, the general solution to the differential equation is:\n\\[\nx(t) = C_1 e^{at} + C_2 e^{-at},\n\\]\nwhere \\(C_1\\) and \\(C_2\\) are constants to be determined using the initial conditions.\n\nNext, we apply the initial conditions.

The characteristic equation for this differential equation is:\n\\[\nr^2 - a^2 = 0.\n\\]\nSolving for \\(r\\), we get:\n\\[\nr^2 = a^2 \\implies r = \\pm a.\n\\]\nThus, the general solution to the differential equation is:\n\\[\nx(t) = C_1 e^{at} + C_2 e^{-at},\n\\]\nwhere \\(C_1\\) and \\(C_2\\) are constants to be determined using the initial conditions.\n\nFirst, we apply the initial condition \\(x(0) = 1\\):\n\\[\nx(0) = C_1 e^{a \\cdot 0} + C_2 e^{-a \\cdot 0} = C_1 + C_2 = 1.\n\\]\nSo, we have:\n\\[\nC_1 + C_2 = 1. \\quad \\text{(1)}\n\\]\n\nNext, we find the first derivative of \\(x(t)\\):\n\\[\n\\dot{x}(t) = a C_1 e^{at} - a C_2 e^{-at}.\n\\]\nWe apply the initial condition \\(\\dot{x}(0) = 0\\):\n\\[\n\\dot{x}(0) = a C_1 e^{a \\cdot 0} - a C_2 e^{-a \\cdot 0} = a C_1 - a C_2 = 0.\n\\]\nSo, we have:\n\\[\na C_1 - a C_2 = 0 \\implies C_1 = C_2. \\quad \\text{(2)}\n\\]\n\nNow, we substitute \\(C_1 = C_2\\) into equation (1):\n\\[\nC_1 + C_1 = 1 \\implies 2C_1 = 1 \\implies C_1 = \\frac{1}{2}.\n\\]\nSince \\(C_1 = C_2\\), we also have \\(C_2 = \\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\nTherefore, the solution to the differential equation that satisfies the given initial conditions is:\n\\[\nx(t) = \\frac{1}{2} e^{at} + \\frac{1}{2} e^{-at}.\n\\]\nThis can be written as:\n\\[\nx(t) = \\frac{e^{at} + e^{-at}}{2} = \\cosh(at).\n\\]\nThus, the solution is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\cosh(at)}.\n\\]"

            "To find the transfer function \\( \\frac{V_o(s)}{V_i(s)} \\) for the given RLC circuit, we need to analyze the circuit in the frequency domain using phasor analysis. Here are the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the circuit elements in the frequency domain:**\n   - The voltage source \\( V_i \\) is represented as \\( V_i(s) \\).\n   - The resistor \\( R \\) is represented as \\( R \\).\n   - The inductor \\( L \\) is represented as \\( sL \\).\n   - The capacitor \\( C \\) is represented as \\( \\frac{1}{sC} \\).\n\n2. **Write the differential equation for the circuit:**\n   The voltage across the capacitor \\( v_o \\) is related to the current \\( i \\) through the capacitor by \\( v_o = \\frac{1}{C} \\int i \\, dt \\). The current \\( i \\) is the same through the resistor, inductor, and capacitor. Therefore, we can write:\n   \\[\n   v_i = iR + sL i + \\frac{1}{sC} v_o\n   \\]\n   Rearranging this equation, we get:\n   \\[\n   v_i = i(R + sL) + \\frac{1}{sC} v_o\n   \\]\n   Solving for \\( i

            "To determine the age of the universe when most hadrons were formed in minutes, we need to use the current age of the universe and the time it took for hadrons to form.

The age of the universe at that time would be the current age minus the time it took for hadrons to form, which is approximately 13.8 billion years minus 1 second.\n\nFirst, we convert the current age of the universe into seconds:\n\\[ 13.8 \\text{ billion years} = 13.8 \\times 10^9 \\text{ years} \\]\n\\[ 1 \\text{ year} = 3.1536 \\times 10^7 \\text{ seconds} \\]\n\\[ 13.8 \\times 10^9 \\text{ years} = 13.8 \\times 10^9 \\times 3.1536 \\times 10^7 \\text{ seconds} \\]\n\\[ 13.8 \\times 3.1536 \\times 10^{16} \\text{ seconds} \\approx 4.4 \\times 10^{17} \\text{ seconds} \\]\n\nNow, we subtract the time it took for hadrons to form (1 second):\n\\[ 4.4 \\times 10^{17} \\text{ seconds} - 1 \\text{ second} \\approx 4.4 \\times 10^{17} \\text{ seconds} \\]\n\nNext, we convert this time into minutes:\n\\[ 1 \\text{ minute} = 60 \\text{ seconds} \\]\n\\[ 4.4 \\times 10^{17} \\text{ seconds} = \\frac{4.4 \\times 10^{17}}{60} \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\\[ \\frac{4.4}{60} \\times 10^{17} \\text{ minutes} \\approx 7.33 \\times 10^{15} \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nRounding to the nearest power of 10, we get:\n\\[ 7.33 \\times 10^{15} \\text{ minutes} \\approx 10^{16} \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nSo, the age of the universe when most hadrons were formed in minutes is:\n\\[ \\boxed{10^{16}} \\]"

When a salt of this type is dissolved in water, it dissociates into its constituent ions. For example, a simple argument is NaCl, which dissociates into Na+ and Cl- ions.\n\n2. **Understand the effect of pH on the solution**: The pH of a solution indicates the concentration of H+ ions in the solution. A pH of 1.0 means that the concentration of H+ ions is 10^-1 M (or 0.1 M). When H+ ions are present in the solution, they will react with the anions in the argument to form neutralize the H+ ions. For example, in the case of NaCl, the H+ ions will react with the Cl- ions to form HCl, which is a strong acid and does not contribute to the net charge of the solution.\n\n3. **Determine the net charge**: Since the solution has a pH of 1.0, it means there are H+ ions present.

            "To solve the problem of finding the coefficient of \\(\\mathrm{CO}_2\\) in the balanced equation for the reaction between \\(\\mathrm{CO}\\) and \\(\\mathrm{O}_2\\) to form \\(\\mathrm{CO}_2\\), we need to start by writing the unbalanced equation:\n\n\\[\n\\mathrm{CO} + \\mathrm{O}_2 \\rightarrow \\mathrm{CO}_2\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to balance the equation. We do this by ensuring that the number of each type of atom is the same on both sides of the equation. Let's start by balance the carbon (C) atoms. There is one carbon atom on the left side and one carbon atom on the right side, so the carbon atoms are already balanced.\n\nNow, let's balance the oxygen (O) atoms. There is one oxygen atom in \\(\\mathrm{O}_2\\) on the left side and two oxygen atoms in \\(\\mathrm{CO}_2\\) on the right side. To balance the oxygen atoms, we need to have two \\(\\mathrm{CO}\\) molecules on the left side:\n\n\\[\n2\\mathrm{CO} + \\mathrm{O}_2 \\rightarrow \\mathrm{CO}_2\n\\]\n\nNow, let's check the balance again. On the left side, we have 2 carbon atoms and 2 + 2 = 4 oxygen atoms. On the right side, we have 1 carbon atom and 2 oxygen atoms. The carbon atoms are already balanced, but the oxygen atoms are not. We need to adjust the coefficients to balance the oxygen atoms. However, we can see that the equation is already balanced with the coefficients we have:\n\n\\[\n2\\mathrm{CO} + \\mathrm{O}_2 \\rightarrow 2\\mathrm{CO}_2\n\\]\n\nTo balance the equation properly, we need to have the same number of \\(\\mathrm{CO}_2\\) molecules on both sides. So, we need to adjust the coefficients again:\n\n\\[\n2\\mathrm{CO} + \\mathrm{O}_2 \\rightarrow 2\\mathrm{CO}_2\n\\]\n\nNow, we can see that the equation is balanced with 2 \\(\\mathrm{CO}\\) molecules, 1 \\(\\mathrm{O}_2\\) molecule, and 2 \\(\\mathrm{CO}_2\\) molecules. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(\\mathrm{O}_2\\) is 1.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{1}\n\\]"

            "To determine the differences in relative electronegativity \\(\\Delta x\\) in \\(e V\\) for the systems \\({H}-{F}\\) and \\({C}-{F}\\), we need to use the bond energy data provided. The bond energy of a molecule is related to the electronegativity difference between the atoms in the bond. The general relationship is that the bond energy of a bond between two atoms is proportional to the electronegativity difference between the two atoms. Specifically, the bond energy \\(E\\) can be approximated by the equation:\n\n\\[ E \\approx k \\Delta x \\]\n\nwhere \\(k\\) is a proportionality constant. For simplicity, we can use the fact that the bond energy is approximately proportional to the electronegativity difference, and we can use the bond energies directly to find the electronegativity differences.\n\nFirst, let's find the electronegativity difference for the system \\({H}-{F}\\). The bond energy of the \\({H}-{F}\\) bond is 565 kJ\/mol. We need to find the electronegativity difference \\(\\Delta x_{HF}\\) such that:\n\n\\[ 565 \\approx k \\Delta x_{HF} \\]\n\nWe can use the bond energy of the \\({F}_{2}\\) molecule, which is 172 kJ\/mol, to find the proportionality constant \\(k\\). The bond energy of a molecule is approximately equal to the sum of the electronegativity differences of all the bonds in the molecule. For a diatomic molecule, the bond energy is approximately equal to twice the electronegativity difference between the two atoms. Therefore, we can write:\n\n\\[ 172 \\approx 2k \\Delta x_F \\]\n\nSolving for \\(k \\Delta x_F\\), we get:\n\n\\[ k \\Delta x_F = \\frac{172}{2} = 86 \\]\n\nNow we can use this value of \\(k \\Delta x_F\\) to find \\(\\Delta x_{HF}\\):\n\n\\[ 565 \\approx k \\Delta x_{HF} \\]\n\\[ \\Delta x_{HF} = \\frac{565}{k} = \\frac{565}{\\frac{86}{\\Delta x_F}} = \\frac{565 \\Delta x_F}{86} \\]\n\nSince \\(\\Delta x_F\\) is the electronegativity difference between two hydrogen atoms, which is very small and can be approximated as negligible, we can use the bond energy of the \\({H}_{2}\\) molecule to find \\(\\Delta x_F\\):\n\n\\[ 436 \\approx 2k \\Delta x_F \\]\n\\[ \\Delta x_F = \\frac{436}{2k} = \\frac{436}{2 \\cdot \\frac{86}{\\Delta x_F}} = \\frac{436 \\Delta x_F}{172} = \\Delta x_F \\]\n\nThis confirms that our value of \\(k \\Delta x_F = 86\\) is consistent. Therefore, we can now find \\(\\Delta x_{HF}\\):\n\n\\[ \\Delta x_{HF} = \\frac{565 \\Delta x_F}{86} = \\frac{565}{86} \\approx 6.54 \\]\n\nNext, let's find the electronegativity difference for the system \\({C}-{F}\\). The bond energy of the \\({C}-{F}\\) bond is 565 kJ\/mol. We need to find the electronegativity difference \\(\\Delta x_{CF}\\) such that:\n\n\\[ 565 \\approx k \\Delta x_{CF} \\]\n\nUsing the same proportionality constant \\(k\\) we found earlier, we get:\n\n\\[ \\Delta x_{CF} = \\frac{565}{k} = \\frac{565}{\\frac{86}{\\Delta x_F}} = \\frac{565 \\Delta x_F}{86} \\]\n\nSince \\(\\Delta x_F\\) is the electronegativity difference between two hydrogen atoms, which is very small and can be approximated as negligible, we can use the bond energy of the \\({C}_{2}\\) molecule to find \\(\\Delta x_F\\):\n\n\\[ 335 \\approx 2k \\Delta x_C \\]\n\\[ \\Delta x_C = \\frac{335}{2k} = \\frac{335}{2 \\cdot \\frac{86}{\\Delta x_F}} = \\frac{335 \\Delta x_F}{172} = \\Delta x_C \\]\n\nThis confirms that our value of \\(k \\Delta x_C = 86\\) is consistent.

            "To determine the optimal price of apples in Cambridge, we need to consider the supply and demand for apples. The local orchard can produce up to 50 apples per day at a constant marginal cost of 25 cents per apple. The store can supply any remaining apples at a constant marginal cost of 75 cents per apple. The total demand for apples in a day is 150 apples when the price is 75 cents per apple.\n\nLet's denote the price of apples by \\( p \\) cents. The local orchard will produce up to 50 apples at a price of \\( p \\) cents, and the store will produce the remaining apples at a price of 75 cents per apple. The total quantity of apples produced and sold will be the sum of the apples produced by the orchard and the apples produced by the store.\n\nThe quantity of apples produced by the orchard is 50 if the price \\( p \\) is less than or equal to 75 cents. If the price \\( p \\) is greater than 75 cents, the orchard will produce 0 apples, and the store will produce the entire 150 apples. Therefore, we need to consider two cases:\n\n1.

            "To determine the algebraic condition that describes a firm that is at an output level that maximizes its profits given its capital in the short-term, we need to use some basic principles of microeconometry, particularly the concept of profit maximization.\n\n1. **Define the profit function**: The profit function for a firm is given by the difference between its total revenue (TR) and its total cost (TC). If we let \\( P \\) be the price per unit of output, \\( Q \\) be the quantity of output, \\( R(Q) \\) be the total revenue function, and \\( C(Q) \\) be the total cost function, then the profit function \\( \\pi(Q) \\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\pi(Q) = R(Q) - C(Q)\n   \\]\n\n2. **Maximize the profit function**: To find the output level \\( Q \\) that maximizes profit, we need to take the derivative of the profit function with respect to \\( Q \\) and set it equal to zero. This is because the maximum point of a function occurs where its first derivative is zero. So, we have:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d\\pi(Q)}{dQ} = \\frac{dR(Q)}{dQ} - \\frac{dC(Q)}{dQ} = 0\n   \\]\n   Here, \\( \\frac{dR(Q)}{dQ} \\) is the marginal revenue (MR) and \\( \\frac{dC(Q)}{dQ} \\) is the marginal cost (MC). Therefore, the condition for profit maximization is:\n   \\[\n   MR(Q) = MC(Q)\n   \\]\n\n3. **Use standard acronyms**: In this context, the standard acronym for \"marginal revenue\" is \"MR\" and the standard acronym for \"marginal cost\" is \"MC\". Therefore, the algebraic condition that describes a firm that is at an output level that maximizes its profits, given its capital in the short-term, is:\n   \\[\n   \\boxed{MR = MC}\n   \\]"

The structure of benzene is a planar ring with alternating single and double bonds. The Hund's rule states that the lowest energy configuration is the one with the maximum number of parallel electrons in the same energy level. For benzene, this means the double bonds are not broken, and the molecule is in a high energy state.\n\nThe ground state energy of benzene can be calculated using the Hund's rule and the Pauli exclusion principle. However, for simplicity, we can use the known ground state energy of benzene, which is approximately -3.5 eV.\n\nNext, we need to determine the ground state energy of benzene with one electron removed. When one electron is removed from benzene, the remaining electrons form a pi conjugated system with a double bond broken. This system is lower in energy than the original pi conjugated system of benzene. The energy difference between the ground state of benzene and the state where one electron is removed is approximately 0.7 eV.\n\nTherefore, the ground state energy of benzene with one electron removed is:\n\n\\[ E(\\text{B}^+) = E(\\text{B}) - 0.7 \\text{ eV} \\]\n\nSubstituting the known values:\n\n\\[ E(\\text{B}) = -3.5 \\text{ eV} \\]\n\\[ E(\\text{B}^+) = -3.5 \\text{ eV} - 0.7 \\text{ eV} = -4.2 \\text{ eV} \\]\n\nNow, we can calculate the ionization potential:\n\n\\[ \\text{IP} = E(\\text{B}^+) - E(\\text{B}) = -4.2 \\text{ eV} - (-3.5 \\text{ eV}) = -4.2 \\text{ eV} + 3.5 \\text{ eV} = -0.7 \\text{ eV} \\]\n\nSince the ionization potential is a positive quantity, we take the absolute value:\n\n\\[ \\text{IP} = 0.7 \\text{ eV} \\]\n\nTherefore, the ionization potential of benzene is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4.2} \\]"

The own price elasticity of demand is defined as:\n\n\\[ \\epsilon_d = \\frac{dQ_d\/dP \\cdot P}{Q_d} \\]\n\nFor a linear demand curve, \\( dQ_d\/dP = -b \\), so the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ \\epsilon_d = \\frac{-b \\cdot P}{Q_d} \\]\n\nGiven that \\(\\epsilon_d = -0.25\\), we can substitute this into the equation:\n\n\\[ -0.25 = \\frac{-b \\cdot P}{Q_d} \\]\n\nRearranging to solve for \\( b \\):\n\n\\[ b = \\frac{0.25 \\cdot Q_d}{P} \\]\n\nWe know from the problem that at a price of \\$20 per ton, the quantity demanded is 100 million tons.
