Therefore, the mass of the black hole is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{4.90 \\times 10^{-81}}{1.989 \\times 10^{30}} = 2.47 \\times 10^{-111} \\]\n\nSince the mass of the black hole is extremely small compared to the Sun's mass, we can express the mass of the black hole as a fraction of the Sun's mass. The mass of the black hole is approximately:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1} \\]\n\nThis means the black hole is about the same mass as the Sun."

            "To determine how the radius \\( R \\) of a star depends on its mass \\( M \\) for a star supported by degenerate electron pressure, we start with the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium:\n\\[\n\\frac{dP}{dr} = -\\frac{GM\\rho}{r}\n\\]\nwhere \\( P \\) is the pressure, \\( r \\) is the radial distance from the center of the star, \\( G \\) is the gravitational constant, \\( M \\) is the mass of the star, and \\( \\rho \\) is the mass density.

The characteristic equation for this differential equation is:\n\\[\nr^2 - a^2 = 0.\n\\]\nSolving for \\(r\\), we get:\n\\[\nr^2 = a^2 \\implies r = \\pm a.\n\\]\nThus, the general solution to the differential equation is:\n\\[\nx(t) = C_1 e^{at} + C_2 e^{-at},\n\\]\nwhere \\(C_1\\) and \\(C_2\\) are constants to be determined using the initial conditions.\n\nNext, we apply the initial conditions.

Therefore, we have:\n   \\[\n   A \\tau + B = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad A = 1\n   \\]\n   Solving these equations, we get \\(A = 1\\) and \\(B = -\\tau\\). Substituting these values back into the partial fraction decomposition, we get:\n   \\[\n   Y(s) = \\frac{1}{s} - \\frac{\\tau}{\\tau s + 1} = \\frac{1}{s} - \\frac{1}{s + \\frac{1}{\\tau}}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Find the inverse Laplace transform:**\n   The inverse Laplace transform of \\(Y(s)\\) is:\n   \\[\n   y(t) = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left\\{\\frac{1}{s}\\right\\} - \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left\\{\\frac{1}{s + \\frac{1}{\\tau}}\\right\\} = 1 - e^{-\\frac{t}{\\tau}}\n   \\]\n   So, the output of the system is:\n   \\[\n   y(t) = 1 - e^{-\\frac{t}{\\tau}}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine the settling time \\(t_s\\):**\n   The system is said to have settled within an error \\(\\pm \\Delta\\) from the final value of 1 when \\(y(t)\\) is within \\(\\Delta\\) of 1. This means:\n   \\[\n   1 - \\Delta \\leq y(t) \\leq 1 + \\Delta\n   \\]\n   Since \\(y(t) = 1 - e^{-\\frac{t}{\\tau}}\\), we have:\n   \\[\n   1 - \\Delta \\leq 1 - e^{-\\frac{t}{\\tau}} \\leq 1 + \\Delta\n   \\]\n   Simplifying the left inequality, we get:\n   \\[\n   -\\Delta \\leq -e^{-\\frac{t}{\\tau}} \\implies \\Delta \\geq e^{-\\frac{t}{\\tau}} \\implies \\ln \\Delta \\geq -\\frac{t}{\\tau} \\implies t \\geq -\\tau \\ln \\Delta\n   \\]\n   Simplifying the right inequality, we get:\n   \\[\n   1 - e^{-\\frac{t}{\\tau}} \\leq 1 + \\Delta \\implies -e^{-\\frac{t}{\\tau}} \\leq \\Delta \\implies e^{-\\frac{t}{\\tau}} \\geq -\\Delta\n   \\]\n   Since \\(\\Delta\\) is a positive number, \\(-\\Delta\\) is negative, and the inequality \\(e^{-\\frac{t}{\\tau}} \\geq -\\Delta\\) is always true for any \\(t \\geq 0\\). Therefore, the relevant inequality is:\n   \\[\n   t \\geq -\\tau \\ln \\Delta\n   \\]\n   Since \\(t\\) must be non-negative, we have:\n   \\[\n   t \\geq \\tau \\ln \\left(\\frac{1}{\\Delta}\\right) = \\tau \\ln \\left(\\frac{1}{\\Delta}\\right) = \\tau \\ln \\left(\\frac{1}{\\Delta}\\right) = \\tau \\ln \\left(\\frac{1}{\\Delta}\\right)\n   \\]\n   So, the settling time \\(t_s\\) is:\n   \\[\n   t_s = \\tau \\ln \\left(\\frac{1}{\\Delta}\\right)\n   \\]\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\tau \\ln \\left(\\frac{1}{\\Delta}\\right)}\n\\]"

A pH of 1.0 indicates that the solution is highly acidic. For a salt of a weak acid and a weak base, the solution can be either neutral, acidic, or basic depending on the relative strengths of the weak acid and the weak base.

            "To determine the wavelength of the photoemission generated by the interaction of the EM radiation with the Germanium crystal, we can use the relationship between the frequency of the EM radiation, the work function of the material, and the wavelength of the photoemission. The relationship is given by the equation:\n\n\\[ E = \\frac{c}{\\lambda} \\]\n\nwhere \\( E \\) is the energy of the EM radian, \\( c \\) is the speed of light, and \\( \\lambda \\) is the wavelength of the EM radian. The energy of the EM radian can also be expressed in terms of its frequency as:\n\n\\[ E = h \\cdot f \\]\n\nwhere \\( h \\) is Planck's constant and \\( f \\) is the frequency of the EM radian. By equating the two expressions for energy, we get:\n\n\\[ h \\cdot f = \\frac{c}{\\lambda} \\]\n\nRearranging this equation to solve for the wavelength \\( \\lambda \\), we get:\n\n\\[ \\lambda = \\frac{c}{h \\cdot f} \\]\n\nWe are given the frequency \\( f = 3.091 \\times 10^{14} \\) Hz, Planck's constant \\( h = 6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\) J\u00b7s, and the speed of light \\( c = 3.00 \\times 10^8 \\) m\/s.

Let's recheck the calculation of the energy in eV. The band gap of Germanium is 0.7 eV, which means the work function of Germanium is 0.7 eV. The energy of the EM radian in eV is:\n\n\\[ E = h \\cdot f = 6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\cdot 3.091 \\times 10^{14} \\cdot \\frac{1 \\text{ eV}}{1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ J}} = 1.240 \\text{ eV} \\]\n\nSince the energy of the EM radian (1.240 eV) is greater than the band gap (0.7 eV), photoemission will occur. The wavelength of the photoemission is given by:\n\n\\[ E = \\frac{c}{\\lambda} \\]\n\nRearranging to solve for the wavelength \\( \\lambda \\):\n\n\\[ \\lambda = \\frac{c}{E} = \\frac{3.00 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m\/s}}{1.240 \\text{ eV} \\cdot 1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ J\/eV}} = \\frac{3.00 \\times 10^8}{1.985 \\times 10^{-19}} = 1.512 \\times 10^{-10} \\text{ m} \\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places, we get:\n\n\\[ \\lambda = 1.51 \\times 10^{-10} \\text{ m} \\]\n\nThus, the wavelength of the photoemission is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1.51 \\times 10^{-10}} \\]"

The lattice parameter (side length of the cubic unit cell) for barium is approximately \\( a = 0.3524 \\) nm.\n\n2. **Determine the coordinates of the atoms in the <110> direction**: The <110> direction in a BCC structure runs from one corner of the cube to the center of the cube. The coordinates of the atoms along this direction can be represented as \\((0,0,0)\\) and \\((\\frac{a}{2}, \\frac{a}{2}, 0)\\).\n\n3. **Calculate the length of the <110> direction**: The length of the <110> direction is the distance between the points \\((0,0,0)\\) and \\((\\frac{a}{2}, \\frac{a}{2}, 0)\\).

            "To determine how many different [110]-type directions lie in the (111) plane in an face centered cubic (FCC) structure, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the direction [110]**: The direction [110] means a direction with components (1, 1, 0) in the reciprocal lattice. In the real space, this direction can be represented by a vector that is a linear combination of the basis vectors of the cubic lattice.\n\n2. **Find the intersection of the [110] direction with the (111) plane**: The (111) plane in an cubic lattice is defined by the equation \\(x + y + z = 0\\). We need to find the points on this plane that are in the direction of [110]. This means we need to find the points that satisfy both the plane equation and the direction equation.\n\n3. **Parameterize the [110] direction**: The [110] direction can be parameterized as \\((t, t, 0)\\) for some real number \\(t\\). We need to check if this direction lies in the (111) plane. Substituting \\((t, t, 0)\\) into the plane equation \\(x + y + z = 0\\), we get \\(t + t + 0 = 0\\), which simplifies to \\(2t = 0\\). This implies \\(t = 0\\), but this is a trivial solution. We need to consider the direction vector in a more general form.\n\n4. **Generalize the direction vector**: The [110] direction can also be represented as a vector in the plane. The normal to the (111) plane is \\((1, 1, 1)\\). The [110] direction vector \\((1, 1, 0)\\) is not perpendicular to the normal of the plane, so it is not in the plane. However, we can find a vector in the plane that is parallel to [110]. This can be done by finding a vector that is perpendicular to the normal of the plane and parallel to [110]. One such vector is \\((1, -1, 0)\\), which is perpendicular to \\((1, 1, 1)\\) and parallel to [110].\n\n5. **Count the unique directions**: The [110] direction can be represented by the vector \\((1, -1, 0)\\) or any scalar multiple of it. In the (111) plane, the [110] direction can be represented by the vectors \\((1, -1, 0)\\), \\((-1, 1, 0)\\), \\((1, 0, -1)\\), \\((0, -1, 1)\\), \\((-1, 0, 1)\\), and \\((0, 1, -1)\\). These are the unique directions of the [110] type that lie in the (111) plane.\n\nTherefore, the number of different [110]-type directions that lie in the (111) plane is \\(\\boxed{3}\\)."

            "To solve the problems, we need to start with the balanced chemical equation for the reaction between carbon monoxide (CO) and oxygen (O\u2082) to form carbon dioxide (CO\u2082). The balanced equation is:\n\n\\[ \\text{CO} + \\text{O}_2 \\rightarrow \\text{CO}_2 \\]\n\n### Subproblem 0: Coefficient of CO\nThe coefficient of CO in the balanced equation is 1. So, the answer is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1} \\]\n\n### Subproblem 1: Coefficient of O\u2082\nTo find the coefficient of O\u2082, we need to balance the equation. The unbalanced equation is:\n\n\\[ \\text{CO} + \\text{O}_2 \\rightarrow \\text{CO}_2 \\]\n\nTo balance it, we need to ensure that the number of oxygen atoms on both sides of the equation is the same. We can do this by adding a coefficient of 1 to CO and a coefficient of 1\/2 to O\u2082. However, since we typically use whole numbers, we can multiply the entire equation by 2 to get:\n\n\\[ 2\\text{CO} + \\text{O}_2 \\rightarrow 2\\text{CO}_2 \\]\n\nNow, the coefficient of O\u2082 is 1. So, the answer is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0.5} \\]\n\n### Subproblem 2: Coefficient of CO\u2082\nFrom the balanced equation \\(2\\text{CO} + \\text{O}_2 \\rightarrow 2\\text{CO}_2\\), the coefficient of CO\u2082 is 2. So, the answer is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1} \\]\n\n### Subproblem 3: Amount of CO consumed\nWe are given that 32.0 g of oxygen react with CO to form CO\u2082. First, we need to find out how many moles of O\u2082 are used. The molar mass of O\u2082 is 32.0 g\/mol. So, the number of moles of O\u2082 is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Moles of O}_2 = \\frac{32.0 \\text{ g}}{32.0 \\text{ g\/mol}} = 1 \\text{ mol} \\]\n\nFrom the balanced equation \\(2\\text{CO} + \\text{O}_2 \\rightarrow 2\\text{CO}_2\\), we see that 1 mole of O\u2082 reacts with 2 moles of CO. Therefore, 1 mole of O\u2082 will react with 2 moles of CO. The molar mass of CO is 28.0 g\/mol, so the mass of CO consumed is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Mass of CO} = 2 \\text{ mol} \\times 28.0 \\text{ g\/mol} = 56.0 \\text{ g} \\]\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{56.0} \\]"

This is because the plane intersects the lattice along two lattice points and does not include the third point that would complete a unit cell.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the area of the (110) plane\nThe area of the (110) plane is the area of a rectangle with sides equal to the lattice parameter \\( a \\) and the distance between the parallel planes, which is \\( \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{2}} \\) for the (110) plane.

This indicates that the atoms do not completely fill the plane, and the correct interpretation is that the planar packing fraction is the ratio of the area occupied by the atoms to the area of the (110) plane, which is:\n\\[ \\text{Planar packing fraction} = \\frac{2 \\times \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\right) a^2}{\\frac{a^2}{\\sqrt{2}}} = \\frac{\\pi a^2 \/ 2}{a^2 \/ \\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{\\pi \\sqrt{2}}{2} \\approx 0.785 \\]\n\nTherefore, the planar packing fraction of the (110) plane for aluminum at 300 K is:\n\\[ \\boxed{0.785} \\]"

To maximize profit, we need to find the value of \\( Q \\) that maximizes \\( \\pi(Q) \\). This is done by taking the derivative of the profit function with respect to \\( Q \\) and setting it equal to zero.\n\nThe first-order condition for profit maximization is:\n\\[ \\frac{d\\pi(Q)}{dQ} = P - \\frac{dC(Q)}{dQ} = 0. \\]\n\nHere, \\( \\frac{dC(Q)}{dQ} \\) is the marginal cost (MC) of producing the output level \\( Q \\). Therefore, the first-order condition can be rewritten as:\n\\[ P = \\frac{dC(Q)}{dQ}. \\]\n\nIn standard notation, the marginal cost (MC) is the derivative of the total cost function with respect to the quantity produced, and the price (P) is the revenue per unit. So, the condition for profit maximization is:\n\\[ P = MC. \\]\n\nThus, the algebraic condition that describes a firm that is at an output level that maximizes its profits, given its capital in the short-term, is:\n\\[ \\boxed{P = MC}. \\]"

The slope \\( b \\) is related to the price coefficient in the own price elasticity of demand, which is given as \\(-0.25\\). The own price elasticity of demand is defined as:\n\n\\[ \\epsilon_d = \\frac{dQ_d\/dP}{Q_d\/P} \\]\n\nFor a linear demand curve, the slope \\( b \\) is the change in quantity demanded per unit change in price. Therefore, the own price elasticity of demand can be expressed as:\n\n\\[ \\epsilon_d = \\frac{-b}{Q_d\/P} \\]\n\nGiven that \\(\\epsilon_d = -0.25\\), we can substitute this into the equation:\n\n\\[ -0.25 = \\frac{-b}{Q_d\/P} \\]\n\nRearranging this equation, we get:\n\n\\[ b = 0.25 \\cdot \\frac{Q_d}{P} \\]\n\nWe know from the problem that at a price of $20 per ton, the quantity demanded is 100 million tons.

            "To find the energy \\( E_{\\widetilde{10}} \\) using non-degenerate perturbation theory to second order, we start with the Hamiltonian \\(\\mathbf{H}\\) given by:\n\\[\n\\mathbf{H} = \\left(\\begin{array}{ccc}\n10 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n1 & 0 & 2 \\\\\n0 & 2 & -10\n\\end{array}\\right)\n\\]\nWe are given that the eigen-eneries of the unperturbed Hamiltonian are \\(E^{(0)} = 10\\), \\(E^{(0)} = 0\\), and \\(E^{(0)} = -10\\) with corresponding eigenfunctions \\(\\left|10\\right\\rangle\\), \\(\\left|0\\right\\rangle\\), and \\(\\left|-10\\right\\rangle\\). The state \\(\\left|\\widetilde{10}\\right\\rangle\\) is dominated by the zero-order state with \\(E^{(0)} = 0\\), so we can write \\(\\left|\\widetilde{10}\\right\\rangle = \\left|0\\right\\rangle + \\alpha \\left|10\\right\\rangle + \\beta \\left|-10\\right\\rangle\\).\n\nThe first-order correction to the energy is zero because \\(\\left|\\widetilde{10}\\right\\rangle\\) is not degenerate with \\(\\left|0\\right\\rangle\\).
