            "To determine the number of ways to split the integers \\(1\\) through \\(14\\) into \\(7\\) pairs such that in each pair, the greater number is at least \\(2\\) times the lesser number, we need to carefully analyze the possible pairs that can be formed.\n\nFirst, let's list the possible pairs:\n- If the lesser number is \\(1\\), the greater number can be \\(2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14\\).

The equation of the line passing through \\((0, a_i)\\) and \\((b_i, 0)\\) can be written as:\n\\[\n\\frac{x}{b_i} + \\frac{y}{a_i} = 1 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad a_i x + b_i y = a_i b_i.\n\\]\nThe perpendicular distance from the point \\((r, r)\\) to this line is given by:\n\\[\n\\frac{|a_i r + b_i r - a_i b_i|}{\\sqrt{a_i^2 + b_i^2}} = r.\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n|a_i r + b_i r - a_i b_i| = r \\sqrt{a_i^2 + b_i^2}.\n\\]\nSince \\(a_i\\) and \\(b_i\\) are positive integers, we can drop the absolute value and rearrange to get:\n\\[\na_i r + b_i r - a_i b_i = r \\sqrt{a_i^2 + b_i^2}.\n\\]\nDividing through by \\(r\\), we get:\n\\[\na_i + b_i - \\frac{a_i b_i}{r} = \\sqrt{a_i^2 + b_i^2}.\n\\]\nSquaring both sides, we obtain:\n\\[\n(a_i + b_i)^2 - 2a_i b_i \\left(1 + \\frac{a_i b_i}{r^2}\\right) = a_i^2 + b_i^2.\n\\]\nSimplifying, we get:\n\\[\na_i^2 + 2a_i b_i + b_i^2 - 2a_i b_i - \\frac{2a_i^2 b_i^2}{r^2} = a_i^2 + b_i^2,\n\\]\nwhich reduces to:\n\\[\n2a_i b_i - \\frac{2a_i^2 b_i^2}{r^2} = 0.\n\\]\nFactoring out \\(2a_i b_i\\), we get:\n\\[\n2a_i b_i \\left(1 - \\frac{a_i b_i}{r^2}\\right) = 0.\n\\]\nSince \\(a_i\\) and \\(b_i\\) are positive integers, we have:\n\\[\n1 = \\frac{a_i b_i}{r^2} \\quad \\text{or} \\quad a_i b_i = r^2.\n\\]\nThus, \\(a_i\\) and \\(b_i\\) are pairs of factors of \\(r^2\\). To minimize \\(r\\), we choose the smallest \\(r\\) such that \\(r^2\\) has at least 14 factor pairs. The smallest such \\(r\\) is 10, because \\(10^2 = 100\\) and the factor pairs of 100 are:\n\\[\n(1, 100), (2, 50), (4, 25), (5, 20), (10, 10).\n\\]\nHowever, we need 14 pairs, so we need to check the next smallest \\(r\\), which is 15. The factor pairs of \\(15^2 = 225\\) are:\n\\[\n(1, 225), (3, 75), (5, 45), (9, 25), (15, 15).\n\\]\nWe need to find a way to get 14 pairs. We can use the pairs \\((1, 225), (3, 75), (5, 45), (9, 25), (15, 15), (15, 15), (15, 15), (15, 15), (15, 15), (15, 15), (15, 15), (15, 15), (15, 15)\\), which gives us 14 pairs. The length of the line segment for the pair \\((15, 15)\\) is:\n\\[\nc_{14} = \\sqrt{15^2 + 15^2} = \\sqrt{2 \\cdot 15^2} = 15\\sqrt{2}.\n\\]\nThe length of the line segment for the pair \\((1, 100)\\) is:\n\\[\nc_1 = \\sqrt{1^2 + 100^2} = \\sqrt{1 + 10000} = \\sqrt{10001}.\n\\]\nThus, the ratio \\(\\frac{c_{14}}{c_1}\\) is:\n\\[\n\\frac{15\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{10001}} = \\frac{15\\sqrt{2}}{100.005} \\approx \\frac{15\\sqrt{2}}{100} = \\frac{15 \\cdot 1.414}{100} = \\frac{21.21}{100} = 0.2121.\n\\]\nHowever, the exact ratio is:\n\\[\n\\frac{15\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{10001}} = \\frac{15\\sqrt{2}}{100.005} = \\frac{15 \\cdot \\sqrt{2}}{100} = \\frac{15 \\cdot 1.414}{100} = \\frac{21.21}{100} = 0.2121.\n\\]\nThus, the exact ratio is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{5}.\n\\]"

            "To determine the area of the region inside both the square and the rectangle, we start by analyzing the given diagram. The rectangle has side lengths 4 and 8, and the square has a side length of 5. The square is positioned such that three of its vertices lie on three different sides of the rectangle.\n\nFirst, let's place the rectangle in the coordinate plane with vertices at \\((0,0)\\), \\((8,0)\\), \\((8,4)\\), and \\((0,4)\\). Assume the square is positioned such that one of its vertices is at \\((x,0)\\) on the bottom side of the rectangle, another vertex is at \\((8,y)\\) on the right side of the rectangle, and the third vertex is at \\((8-x,4)\\) on the top side of the rectangle. The side length of the square is 5, so the distance between \\((x,0)\\) and \\((8,y)\\) is 5, and the distance between \\((8,y)\\) and \\((8-x,4)\\) is also 5.\n\nSince the distance between \\((x,0)\\) and \\((8,y)\\) is 5, we have:\n\\[\n(8-x)^2 + y^2 = 25\n\\]\nSince the distance between \\((8,y)\\) and \\((8-x,4)\\) is 5, we have:\n\\[\nx^2 + (4-y)^2 = 25\n\\]\n\nWe also know that the distance between \\((x,0)\\) and \\((8-x,4)\\) is 5, so:\n\\[\nx^2 + 4^2 = 25 \\implies x^2 + 16 = 25 \\implies x^2 = 9 \\implies x = 3 \\text{ (since } x \\text{ must be positive)}\n\\]\nSubstituting \\(x = 3\\) into the first equation, we get:\n\\[\n(8-3)^2 + y^2 = 25 \\implies 5^2 + y^2 = 25 \\implies 25 + y^2 = 25 \\implies y^2 = 0 \\implies y = 0\n\\]\nThis is not possible since \\(y\\) must be positive. Instead, we should use the second equation:\n\\[\n3^2 + (4-y)^2 = 25 \\implies 9 + (4-y)^2 = 25 \\implies (4-y)^2 = 16 \\implies 4-y = 4 \\text{ or } 4-y = -4\n\\]\nSince \\(y\\) must be positive, we have:\n\\[\n4-y = 4 \\implies y = 0 \\text{ (not possible)} \\implies 4-y = -4 \\implies y = 8\n\\]\nThis is also not possible. Instead, we should use the correct interpretation of the geometry. The correct interpretation is that the square is positioned such that the side of the square is not aligned with the sides of the rectangle but rather at an angle. The correct approach is to use the fact that the area of the region inside both the square and the rectangle is the area of the rectangle minus the area of the three right triangles that are outside the rectangle but inside the square.\n\nThe area of the rectangle is:\n\\[\n4 \\times 8 = 32\n\\]\nThe area of the square is:\n\\[\n5 \\times 5 = 25\n\\]\nThe area of the three right triangles is the area of the square minus the area of the rectangle:\n\\[\n25 - 32 + \\text{area of the region inside both} = 0 \\implies \\text{area of the region inside both} = 25 - 16 = 9\n\\]\nThus, the area of the region inside both the square and the rectangle is:\n\\[\n\\frac{16}{25}\n\\]\nThe numerator of the simplest fraction that represents the area of the region inside both the square and the rectangle is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{16}\n\\]"

            "Given that medians \\(\\overline{AD}\\) and \\(\\overline{BE}\\) of \\(\\triangle ABC\\) intersect at \\(G\\) and \\(\\triangleAGB\\) is equilateral, we need to find \\(\\cos(C)\\) in the form \\(\\frac{m\\sqrt{p}}{n}\\) and determine \\(m+n+p\\).\n\nFirst, recall that the centroid \\(G\\) of a triangle divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the longer segment being closer to the vertex. Therefore, \\(AG = \\frac{2}{3}AD\\) and \\(BG = \\frac{2}{3}BE\\).\n\nSince \\(\\triangleAGB\\) is equilateral, all its sides are equal, so \\(AG = BG = AB\\).

            "To find the area of the resulting 12-sided outer nonconvex polygon, we need to break down the problem into manageable parts. The polygon consists of a square with side length 1 and four regular hexagons surrounding it.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the area of the square:\n\\[\n\\text{Area of the square} = 1^2 = 1\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find the area of one regular hexagon. The side length of each hexagon is equal to the side length of the square, which is 1. The area \\(A\\) of a regular hexagon with side length \\(s\\) is given by:\n\\[\nA = \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2} s^2\n\\]\nSubstituting \\(s = 1\\):\n\\[\nA = \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\cdot 1^2 = \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2}\n\\]\n\nSince there are four hexagons, the total area of the four hexagons is:\n\\[\n4 \\times \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2} = 6\\sqrt{3}\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to consider the overlapping areas. Each hexagon shares one of its sides with the square, and each pair of adjacent hexagons shares a segment of their sides with the square. However, the overlapping areas are not straightforward to calculate directly. Instead, we can use the fact that the total area of the polygon is the sum of the areas of the square and the four hexagons minus the areas of the overlapping regions.\n\nTo find the area of the overlapping regions, we observe that each pair of adjacent hexagons shares a segment of their sides with the square, and these segments form right triangles. The area of each of these right triangles is:\n\\[\n\\text{Area of one right triangle} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 1 \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}\n\\]\nSince there are four such right triangles (one for each pair of adjacent hexagons), the total area of the overlapping regions is:\n\\[\n4 \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} = \\sqrt{3}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the area of the resulting 12-sided outer nonconvex polygon is:\n\\[\n1 + 6\\sqrt{3} - \\sqrt{3} = 1 + 5\\sqrt{3}\n\\]\n\nIn the form \\(m\\sqrt{n} + p\\), we have \\(m = 5\\), \\(n = 3\\), and \\(p = 1\\). The absolute value of \\(m + n + p\\) is:\n\\[\n|5 + 3 + 1| = 9\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{9}\n\\]"

            "To solve the problem, let's denote the five positive integers as \\(a, b, c, d, e\\) in non-decreasing order, i.e., \\(a \\leq b \\leq c \\leq d \\leq e\\). The median of these five numbers is \\(c\\), the mode is the number that appears most frequently, and the arithmetic mean is the sum of the numbers divided by 5.\n\nWe are given two conditions:\n1. The mode is 2 greater than the median.\n2. The median is 2 greater than the arithmetic mean.\n\nLet's denote the mode by \\(m\\). From the first condition, we have:\n\\[ m = c + 2 \\]\n\nFrom the second condition, we have:\n\\[ c = \\frac{a + b + c + d + e}{5} + 2 \\]\nMultiplying both sides by 5, we get:\n\\[ 5c = a + b + c + d + e + 10 \\]\nRearranging terms, we get:\n\\[ 4c = a + b + d + e + 10 \\]\n\nSince \\(m\\) is the mode, it must appear more frequently than any other number. The simplest case to consider is that \\(m\\) appears at least three times. Let's assume \\(m = c + 2\\) appears three times, and the other two numbers are different from each other and from \\(m\\). The simplest configuration is \\(a = b = c + 2\\) and \\(d = e = c + 4\\). This gives us:\n\\[ a = c + 2, \\quad b = c + 2, \\quad d = c + 4, \\quad e = c + 4 \\]\n\nSubstituting these into the equation \\(4c = a + b + d + e + 10\\), we get:\n\\[ 4c = (c + 2) + (c + 2) + (c + 4) + (c + 4) + 10 \\]\n\\[ 4c = 4c + 12 + 10 \\]\n\\[ 4c = 4c + 22 \\]\nThis is a contradiction, so \\(m\\) cannot be \\(c + 2\\) appearing exactly three times.

So, let's try \\(m = c + 2\\) appearing five times, which is not possible since we only have five numbers. The next simplest configuration is \\(a = b = c = c + 2\\) and \\(d = c + 4\\), but we need to adjust the values to fit the conditions.

The correct configuration is \\(a = b = c = c + 2\\) and \\(d = c + 4\\), and \\(e = c + 6\\).

We are given the equation \\(2^{a_7} = 2^{27} \\cdot a_7\\).

To find the minimum possible value of \\(a_2\\), we need to minimize \\(a_2 = a_0 + 2d\\). From \\(a_0 + 7d = 32\\), we can express \\(a_0\\) as \\(a_0 = 32 - 7d\\). Substituting this into the expression for \\(a_2\\), we get:\n\n\\[a_2 = a_0 + 2d = 32 - 7d + 2d = 32 - 5d.\\]\n\nTo minimize \\(a_2\\), we need to maximize \\(d\\). Since \\(a_0\\) and \\(d\\) are positive integers, \\(d\\) must be a positive integer such that \\(a_0 = 32 - 7d > 0\\). This implies \\(32 > 7d \\implies d < \\frac{32}{7} \\approx 4.57\\).

            "To determine the units digit of the sum of the 2023 numbers in the 2023rd row of the given triangular array, we first need to understand the pattern in the units digits of the numbers in each row.\n\nLet's start by examining the units digits of the numbers in the first few rows:\n\nRow 1: \\(1\\)\nUnits digits: \\(1\\)\n\nRow 2: \\(1 \\quad 1\\)\nUnits digits: \\(1, 1\\)\n\nRow 3: \\(1 \\quad 3 \\quad 1\\)\nUnits digits: \\(1, 3, 1\\)\n\nRow 4: \\(1 \\quad 5 \\quad 5 \\quad 1\\)\nUnits digits: \\(1, 5, 5, 1\\)\n\nRow 5: \\(1 \\quad 7 \\quad 11 \\quad 7 \\quad 1\\)\nUnits digits: \\(1, 7, 1, 7, 1\\)\n\nWe observe that the units digits of the numbers in each row follow a pattern. Let's denote the units digit of the \\(n\\)-th row by \\(a_n\\). From the above rows, we can see that the units digits of the numbers in the \\(n\\)-th row are the same as the units digits of the numbers in the \\((n-1)\\)-th row, but each number is increased by 2 (since each interior entry is 1 greater than the sum of the two numbers diagonally above it in the previous row, and the units digit of 1 is 1).\n\nTo find a general pattern, let's look at the units digits of the first few rows again:\n\nRow 1: \\(1\\)\nUnits digits: \\(1\\)\n\nRow 2: \\(1 \\quad 1\\)\nUnits digits: \\(1, 1\\)\n\nRow 3: \\(1 \\quad 3 \\quad 1\\)\nUnits digits: \\(1, 3, 1\\)\n\nRow 4: \\(1 \\quad 5 \\quad 5 \\quad 1\\)\nUnits digits: \\(1, 5, 5, 1\\)\n\nRow 5: \\(1 \\quad 7 \\quad 11 \\quad 7 \\quad 1\\)\nUnits digits: \\(1, 7, 1, 7, 1\\)\n\nWe can see that the units digits of the numbers in each row are the same as the units digits of the numbers in the previous row, but each number is increased by 2. This means that the units digits of the numbers in the \\(n\\)-th row are the same as the units digits of the numbers in the \\((n-1)\\)-th row, but each number is increased by 2.\n\nTo find the units digit of the sum of the numbers in the 2023rd row, we need to find the units digit of the sum of the units digits of the numbers in the 2023rd row. Since the units digits of the numbers in each row are the same as the units digits of the numbers in the previous row, but each number is increased by 2, we can see that the units digits of the numbers in the 2023rd row are the same as the units digits of the numbers in the 1st row, but each number is increased by 2.\n\nThe units digits of the numbers in the 1st row are \\(1\\). Therefore, the units digits of the numbers in the 2023rd row are \\(1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, \\ldots\\). This is a repeating sequence with a period of 5.\n\nTo find the units digit of the sum of the units digits of the numbers in the 2023rd row, we need to find the units digit of the sum of the first 2023 numbers in this sequence. Since the sequence repeats every 5 numbers, we can find the units digit of the sum of the first 5 numbers in the sequence, and then multiply this by the number of complete cycles in 2023 numbers, and add the units digit of the sum of the remaining numbers.\n\nThe units digits of the first 5 numbers in the sequence are \\(1, 3, 5, 7, 9\\). The sum of these units digits is \\(1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 = 25\\). The units digit of 25 is 5.\n\nSince 2023 divided by 5 gives a quotient of 404 and a remainder of 3, the units digit of the sum of the first 2023 numbers in the sequence is the same as the units digit of \\(404 \\times 5 + 1 + 3 + 5 = 2020 + 9 = 2029\\). The units digit of 2029 is 9.\n\nTherefore, the units digit of the sum of the 2023 numbers in the 2023rd row is \\(\\boxed{9}\\)."

            "To determine the value of \\( x \\) in Coinland, we need to find the largest amount of money that cannot be expressed using the given coin values of 6, 10, and 15 cents. This problem can be approached using the concept of the Frobenius coin problem, which deals with finding the largest number that cannot be expressed as a non-negative integer combination of given coin values.\n\nFirst, we note that the coin values are 6, 10, and 15. We will use the fact that for two coprime integers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), the largest number that cannot be expressed as a non-negative integer combination of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) is given by \\( ab - a - b \\). However, since we have three coin values, we need to consider the problem more carefully.\n\nWe start by checking if any two of the coin values are coprime. The greatest common divisor (gcd) of 6 and 10 is 2, so they are not coprime. The gcd of 6 and 15 is 3, so they are not coprime. The gcd of 10 and 15 is 5, so they are not coprime. Since none of the pairs are coprime, we need to use a different approach.\n\nWe will use the fact that the largest number that cannot be expressed using three coin values can be found by checking the combinations of the coin values. We will start by checking the largest number that cannot be expressed using only the 6 and 10 cent coins, and then check if adding the 15 cent coin changes the result.\n\nThe largest number that cannot be expressed using only 6 and 10 cent coins is given by the Frobenius number for 6 and 10, which is \\( 6 \\times 10 - 6 - 10 = 50 \\). However, we need to check if adding the 15 cent coin changes this result.\n\nWe will check the numbers from 51 upwards to see if they can be expressed using the coin values 6, 10, and 15. We can use a systematic approach to check each number:\n\n- 51: Not possible (51 = 3 \\times 15 + 6 \\times 1)\n- 52: Not possible (52 = 2 \\times 15 + 6 \\times 2)\n- 53: Not possible (53 = 3 \\times 15 + 6 \\times 1 + 10 \\times 1)\n- 54: Possible (54 = 9 \\times 6)\n- 55: Possible (55 = 3 \\times 15 + 10 \\times 1)\n- 56: Possible (56 = 2 \\times 15 + 6 \\times 2)\n- 57: Possible (57 = 3 \\times 15 + 6 \\times 1)\n- 58: Possible (58 = 2 \\times 15 + 6 \\times 2 + 10 \\times 1)\n- 59: Possible (59 = 3 \\times 15 + 6 \\times 1 + 10 \\times 1)\n- 60: Possible (60 = 4 \\times 15)\n\nSince 59 is the largest number that cannot be expressed using the coin values 6, 10, and 15, the value of \\( x \\) is 49. The sum of the digits of 49 is \\( 4 + 9 = 13 \\).\n\nThus, the answer is \\(\\boxed{13}\\)."

Since the triangle has an angle of \\(120^\\circ\\), we can use the Law of Cosines to find \\(d\\).\n\nThe Law of Cosines states that for a triangle with sides \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) and angle \\(\\gamma\\) opposite side \\(c\\), we have:\n\\[ c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \\cos(\\gamma). \\]\nIn our case, let the side opposite the \\(120^\\circ\\) angle be \\(6+2d\\). Then we have:\n\\[ (6+2d)^2 = 6^2 + (6+d)^2 - 2 \\cdot 6 \\cdot (6+d) \\cdot \\cos(120^\\circ). \\]\nSince \\(\\cos(120^\\circ) = -\\frac{1}{2}\\), the equation becomes:\n\\[ (6+2d)^2 = 36 + (6+d)^2 + 6(6+d). \\]\nExpanding both sides, we get:\n\\[ 36 + 24d + 4d^2 = 36 + 36 + 12d + d^2 + 36 + 6d, \\]\n\\[ 36 + 24d + 4d^2 = 108 + 18d + d^2. \\]\nRearranging terms, we have:\n\\[ 3d^2 + 6d - 72 = 0, \\]\n\\[ d^2 + 2d - 24 = 0. \\]\nWe solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \\(d = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\), where \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 2\\), and \\(c = -24\\):\n\\[ d = \\frac{-2 \\pm \\sqrt{4 + 96}}{2} = \\frac{-2 \\pm \\sqrt{100}}{2} = \\frac{-2 \\pm 10}{2}. \\]\nThis gives us two solutions: \\(d = 4\\) and \\(d = -6\\). Since \\(d\\) must be positive, we have \\(d = 4\\).\n\nThus, the side lengths of the triangle are 6, 10, and 14. To find the area of the triangle, we use the formula for the area of a triangle with sides \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) and an angle \\(\\gamma\\) opposite side \\(c\\):\n\\[ \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2}ab \\sin(\\gamma). \\]\nHere, \\(a = 6\\), \\(b = 10\\), and \\(\\gamma = 120^\\circ\\).

The rectangle can be placed either horizontally or vertically. If placed horizontally, it can cover any of the following pairs of squares: (1,2), (2,3), (4,5), (5,6), (7,8), (8,9). If placed vertically, it can cover any of the following pairs of squares: (1,4), (2,5), (3,6), (4,7), (5,8), (6,9).\n\nThere are 6 possible horizontal placements and 6 possible vertical placements, giving us a total of 12 possible placements for the rectangle.\n\nTo ensure that we cover at least one square of the rectangle, we need to consider the worst-case scenario where the rectangle is placed in such a way that it avoids our guesses as long as possible. We can use a strategy of guessing squares in a way that maximizes the information we get from each guess.\n\nOne effective strategy is to guess the center square of the grid, which is the square at position (2,2). If the center square is not covered, then the rectangle cannot be placed in such a way that it avoids the center square. This means that the rectangle must be placed either horizontally or vertically, and at least one of its squares must be covered by our guess.\n\nIf the center square is covered, then we have already found a covered square. If the center square is not covered, then we need to guess one of the adjacent squares to the center square. By guessing the adjacent squares, we can ensure that we cover at least one square of the rectangle. For example, if we guess the square at position (2,1), and it is not covered, then the rectangle must be placed vertically, and the square at position (2,3) must be covered. Similarly, if we guess the square at position (1,2), and it is not covered, then the rectangle must be placed horizontally, and the square at position (3,2) must be covered.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of turns required to ensure that at least one of the guessed squares is covered by the rectangle is 3. This is because we need to guess the center square and then one of the adjacent squares to the center square, and in the worst-case scenario, we need one more guess to ensure that we cover at least one square of the rectangle.\n\nThus, the minimum number of turns required is \\(\\boxed{3}\\)."

            "To determine the area of the region defined by the inequality \\( | | x | - 1 | + | | y | - 1 | \\le 1 \\), we need to analyze the expression step by step.\n\nFirst, let's rewrite the inequality in a more manageable form. Define \\( u = |x| \\) and \\( v = |y| \\). The inequality then becomes:\n\\[ |u - 1| + |v - 1| \\le 1. \\]\n\nThis inequality describes a diamond (or square rotated by 45 degrees) centered at \\((1,1)\\) with side length \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) in the \\(uv\\)-plane. To see why, consider the different cases for the absolute values:\n\n1. If \\( u \\ge 1 \\) and \\( v \\ge 1 \\), then \\( |u-1| = u-1 \\) and \\( |v-1| = v-1 \\), so the inequality becomes \\( (u-1) + (v-1) \\le 1 \\) or \\( u + v \\le 3 \\).\n2. If \\( u \\ge 1 \\) and \\( v < 1 \\), then \\( |u-1| = u-1 \\) and \\( |v-1| = 1-v \\), so the inequality becomes \\( (u-1) + (1-v) \\le 1 \\) or \\( u - v \\le 1 \\).\n3. If \\( u < 1 \\) and \\( v \\ge 1 \\), then \\( |u-1| = 1-u \\) and \\( |v-1| = v-1 \\), so the inequality becomes \\( (1-u) + (v-1) \\le 1 \\) or \\( -u + v \\le 1 \\) or \\( v - u \\le 1 \\).\n4. If \\( u < 1 \\) and \\( v < 1 \\), then \\( |u-1| = 1-u \\) and \\( |v-1| = 1-v \\), so the inequality becomes \\( (1-u) + (1-v) \\le 1 \\) or \\( 2 - u - v \\le 1 \\) or \\( u + v \\ge 1 \\).\n\nThese four inequalities describe a diamond in the \\(uv\\)-plane with vertices at \\((2,1)\\), \\((1,2)\\), \\((0,1)\\), and \\((1,0)\\). The area of this diamond is the same as the area of a square with side length \\(\\sqrt{2}\\), which is \\(2\\).\n\nSince \\(u = |x|\\) and \\(v = |y|\\), the region in the \\(xy\\)-plane is a square rotated by 45 degrees with side length 2. The area of this square is also 2.\n\nTherefore, the area of the region in the coordinate plane defined by \\( | | x | - 1 | + | | y | - 1 | \\le 1 \\) is \\(\\boxed{4}\\)."
